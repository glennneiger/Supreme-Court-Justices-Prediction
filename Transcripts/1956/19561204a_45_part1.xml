            <label>Mr. Lucien F. Marion</label>
            <text syncTime="17.000" offset="171342">May it please this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.124" offset="183881">This is a suit under the Federal Tort Claims Act asking for damages caused by a forest fire in 1951 which damages are alleged to have been caused by the negligence of the Forest Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.555" offset="257546">I might call Your Honors attention at this point that the fact that Number 47 which follows this case immediately is a companion suit being by other plaintiffs arising out of the same fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.125" offset="311881">The case is here on a challenge to the sufficiency of the complaint to state facts upon which a claim may be based.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.472" offset="341243">The District Judge in Tacoma held that they sustained a motion to dismiss and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.777" offset="390457">Under the circumstances, all of the allegations of the complaint must be accepted as true and construed in a light, the most favorable plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.926" offset="435075">Federal Tort Claims Act makes the United States liable for the negligent acts and omissions of its employees under circumstances where the United States if a private individual would be liable claimant under the law of the place where the acts and omissions occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.108" offset="523786">Section 2680 of Title 28 contains the exceptions to the waiver of the immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.168" offset="560044">No one of those exceptions is here involved nor urged by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.353" offset="580733">Particularly, the discretionary function exception is not involved, as all acts and omissions complained of were at the operational level.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.888" offset="630888">It has been helpful to us in our consideration of this case and in our presentation of it to ask ourselves this question and I offer it because I think it will also be helpful to Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.496" offset="693373">Let us assume that the facts here were exactly transposed that the United States with the plaintiff, that Rayonier Incorporated was the defendant that the acts and omissions complained of were those of Rayonier.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.432" offset="769128">Is there any reason in fact or in law why the positions could not be transposed in all material respects?</text>
            <text syncTime="173.990" offset="799326">And if so, would Rayonier be liable to the Government?</text>
            <text syncTime="178.771" offset="818448">Since Rayonier, he's a private individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.246" offset="828374">Then if it would be liable, it would follow that -- by that test, the United States is liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.473" offset="861288">This fire started on the Olympic Peninsula on August 6, 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.654" offset="890023">It started on land which the defendant owned, had control of and free of unrestricted access to.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.909" offset="923042">These are the allegations of the complaint which I am now recounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.963" offset="947179">It started when fire or sparks were thrown from the passing locomotive into accumulations of inflammables on the right of way in the adjoining property, both Government owned and controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.907" offset="1002977">It -- from the spot far stage, it spread to a 60 -- 60-acre carrier were it was controlled for about a day and then jumped into a large area of cut-off logged-off lands about 1600 acres in area.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.265" offset="1084479">It was contained and controlled in that 1600-acre area on August 11th.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.494" offset="1113318">It continued to burn in a small reform in this logged-off area until the early morning hours of September 20th.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.824" offset="1154696">In the early morning hours on that day, I think around two or three, winds carried as far south of the 1600-acre area into a joining slash, young growth and virgin timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.057" offset="1227630">That caused the fire which burned an area, roughly 20 miles in an east-west direction and up to five miles in a north-south direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.673" offset="1270053">After the fire broke away on the 20th of September, there was nothing anybody could do about it and no negligence is claimed from that occasion on.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.278" offset="1320521">Negligence is asserted on behalf of the -- on the part of the Forest Service, both before the fire ever started because of the fire hazardous conditions and practices carried on, on this Government owned and controlled land.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.905" offset="1386977">Negligence is claimed and failure to eliminate or extinguish the fire immediately in the spot fire stage, again at the 60-acre stage and again during the 1600-acre stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.632" offset="1445909">There were adequate men and equipment and water available at all times to extinguish the fire, the Forest Service, and let's say this too.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.574" offset="1501706">Immediately, upon the outbreak of the fire on August 6th, the Forest Service was notified.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.222" offset="1528247">They immediately stepped in, assumed supervision, direction and control of the fire fighting at all times thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.161" offset="1568057">But during this whole period from August 6 to September 20th, the Forest Service actively took part in the supervision, direction and control of the fire fighting activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.029" offset="1623437">This was known to petitioner and others in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.201" offset="1640155">And the petitioner and others relied upon the Forest Service having been induced to rely upon by their announced position and relied upon the Forest Service to conduct its chore in a prudent manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.087" offset="1715702">It is highly important, Your Honors, that you have in mind at all times the importance of the practical operation and the physical facts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.279" offset="1772440">I am somewhat concerned that the Court of Appeals apparently did not appreciate the significance of it and its importance in the part that the Forest Service plays here and the character of its activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.056" offset="1839626">First, have in mind that this forested area on the Olympic Peninsula is vast in timber and vast areas of cutover lands and that the Government is by far the largest owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.348" offset="1908799">The Government's ownerships are scattered throughout and intermingled with private ownerships, so that you cannot go very far in one direction up there without running into government land and government timber which is under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.877" offset="1994898">The Forest Service and the private timber operators there are essentially in the same business that is the timber business.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.704" offset="2054144">The complaint alleges this timber was held by the Government with pecuniary gain and profit.It is sold by the -- under Forest Service jurisdiction to private enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.862" offset="2106807">A large part of the Forest Service activities, in fact, the bulk of it has to do with the development of timber sales, necessary appraisals, the conduct of sales, the engineering required in laying out the sales, laying out roads, conducting the sales and then supervising the logging of the timber in the course of those sales and the construction of roads and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.397" offset="2220910">Forest Service also has other duties such as they maintain some forest camps.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.462" offset="2245256">They give information to recreations and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.073" offset="2267617">Now, the Forest Service in common with all the other timber operators there are naturally concerned about the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.978" offset="2315264">The Forest Service, however, just like the timber operators, does not in itself maintain a fire department.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.619" offset="2353821">It has relatively few employees, relatively little equipment and neither the Forest Service nor any other operator has sufficient equipment or men of which to cope with a major fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.194" offset="2424142">However, because of this, the Forest Service and the private industries recognized that cooperation is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.098" offset="2463744">If I own a track of timber here, I am concerned that fire, about any fire starting on my land or immediately close to my land which threatens my timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.289" offset="2520482">We recognized that it would be uneconomical for each to maintain a complete fire department and it is not necessary because in that area where the timber industries are the main source of livelihood, everyone will respond willingly, men will serve in fire fighting activities, people will furnish their equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.519" offset="2633435">Now, to carry out this battle against the common enemy, both the Forest Service and private industries have what they call a fire suppression plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.147" offset="2691950">That fire suppression plan contains a list of the persons available to fight fires, the equipment to available to fight fires and how those persons can be reached and brought to the scene of the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.475" offset="2749315">That is the type of plan of the Forest Service has.</text>

            <text syncTime="673.460" offset="2797171">Your Honor, it's not a matter of joining in.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.379" offset="2808874">I mean Rayonier will have a list of Forest Service employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.987" offset="2827368">It will have a list of ex-company's employees and so and so, (Inaudible) contractors and employees and the list of their equipment where they're located.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.140" offset="2867911">It occur -- fire occurs on Rayonier's land, Rayonier will step in --</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="694.468" offset="2881285">But there's no -- there's no association of (Voice Overlap) --</text>

          <turn speaker="lucien_f_marion" startTime="696.913" stopTime="833.559">
            <label>Mr. Lucien F. Marion</label>
            <text syncTime="696.913" offset="2891003">There's no association, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.037" offset="2903542">The point is that if Rayonier were party on this land as the fire had started, Rayonier would send its men there and they would take charge and they would direct it.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.556" offset="2945546">And they would follow Rayonier's plan to call in all the men and equipment from our neighbors as well as our own to supervise this and fight it.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.621" offset="2989850">And that is the case with the Forest Service here.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.711" offset="3006255">Those are the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.416" offset="3013047">It's this forest.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.420" offset="3021093">There is this fire suppression plan and the fact that they do not maintain a fire department.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.514" offset="3049409">Let me also point out that under the statute, 16 United States Code 5 -- 51, I believe, it is cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.055" offset="3091623">The Forest Service is authorized to engage in fire or to take steps necessary to protect the public forest from fire depredation.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.594" offset="3133733">No place in the statutes to refine their authorization to maintain a fire department for the public at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.204" offset="3168214">Forest Service is also authorized to cooperate with the State and private industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.891" offset="3190888">But the cooperation which I have just described, which is necessary, and that's the basis for this so-called cooperation.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.307" offset="3232580">May I also point out that the State of Washington has sets standards of good forestry practices for private industries and all timber owners, those standards being reflected both from the statutes and common law and they prescribed certain minimum standards to reduce, eliminate or minimize the fire hazard in forest areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.912" offset="3339055">Those standards may to a stranger seem high but they obviously are not because the timber industry has operated successfully under them for some 70 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.312" offset="3400600">Now, this brings us to -- with that factual background, Your Honors, District Judge Boldt --</text>

            <text syncTime="989.261" offset="4060453">For the 40 days and 40 nights during which this fire burned the 1600-acre area, there was hardly any rain.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.029" offset="4099532">In fact, there had been -- in fact, there's no rain for period of 4 months prior to that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.195" offset="4124191">During that period of time, Forest Service took no effort to seek out and extinguish the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.424" offset="4161076">Although, it was known that in these dry periods, the prevailing winds are northeasterly, they are dry winds, the humidity was low and in the lee of this 1600-acre area were all these vast stands of virgin timber which are endangered by any fire not properly handled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.963" offset="4267238">This was maintained by the district ranger only on a patrol basis and only during the daytime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.530" offset="4293465">After the normal quitting time of the day, there was no one on duty watching this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.035" offset="4319483">Also, it is significant that just one week before the breakaway on September 20th, fire actually did blow out of the sparks in this area and jumped the fire alarms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.938" offset="4363160">That it so happened, there were men on duty at that time and they were able to extinguish that fire.</text>

            <text syncTime="1174.535" offset="4801494">That under the reasoning of the Court of Appeals, they assumed that -- had there been negligence in their duty under state law because of these conditions prior to the fire and the conduct before the breakaway.</text>

            <text syncTime="1209.717" offset="4942242">I wish to point out and urge the reason why Dalehite is not applicable in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.408" offset="4972962">There, the Coast Guard was charged apparently with negligence, precise nature which is not clear from the opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.317" offset="5016639">But at any rate, it is clear that the Coast Guard did not supervise or undertake the direction of the fire fighting at the Texas City fire or did they induce reliance on others that they would so fight the fire or supervise it and act prudently.</text>

            <text syncTime="1309.914" offset="5343065">Thirdly, as we read the Dalehite case, there was no duty established on the Coast Guard and duty is an essential element of actionable negligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1334.720" offset="5442226">Next, in the -- as we understand the Dalehite facts, the Coast Guard do not even get into the act of fire fighting and that it was only about an hour between the time that the fires first broke out in the time of the terrific explosion which caused -- caused the damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.629" offset="5517876">Here, the Forest Service was in this from the beginning.</text>

            <text syncTime="1362.598" offset="5553716">Now lastly, the Forest Service employees were not public firemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.544" offset="5577540">Their duties were associated with the administration of government timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.612" offset="5593840">They had no authority to act, otherwise, and in connections with the administration of government timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.194" offset="5628113">That should be compared to the situation with this public firemen immunity as normally announced and that is the City Fire Departments where they are maintained for the benefit of one and all in the city to protect any persons, all persons and property in the city, not associated with city-owned property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.278" offset="5716511">And those cases which the public firemen immunity doctrine is announced.</text>

            <text syncTime="1576.102" offset="6407816">Indian Towing, announced by this Court about a year ago, establishes several things which are very pertinent to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.661" offset="6441984">First, it rejects municipal corporation law as not applicable to the administration of the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.842" offset="6486706">The public firemen immunity theory is definitely a child of municipal corporation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.028" offset="6511470">It is found nowhere else in the basis of immunity stems from the fact that the cases say that fire fighting is a governmental function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.721" offset="6562252">These fire departments are maintained for the benefit of one and all of public's function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.320" offset="6580642">From that theory, the city cannot be held on the doctrine of respondeat superior for the negligence of its firemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.491" offset="6609377">Second, Indian Towing establishes that the public function or governmental character of an employee's activities is immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.448" offset="6653158">Now, that is consistent with many holdings under the Federal Tort Claims Act and it's hard to justify immunity of the Forest Service as being a public engagement in light of the holdings of liability of the United States for negligence of its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.641" offset="6729958">And say the conduct of lighthouses, the operation of military vehicles, the operation of military airplanes, operation of airport controlled towers, Coast Guard rescue services, even the classic example cited as the type of thing for which the Government should be liable, namely, the negligence of a male truck driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.983" offset="6823267">That certainly is in a public function or governmental in character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.777" offset="6850435">It -- lastly, Indian Towing establishes that where the Government undertakes to act, whether you call it a volunteer, an actor, a good samaritan or by what meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.576" offset="6905710">If he undertakes to act and induces reliance, he is then bound to act prudently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.241" offset="6932355">And if he is negligent in the conduct to that activity, then he must pay for the consequences of his negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.764" offset="6966418">Now, Your Honors, if we reverse the situation of the parties here and there's no reason why Rayonier might not have found itself and precisely the same situation, then I say, Rayonier would have been liable and I have yet to hear from the Attorney General, to whom we have opposed this question repeatedly, would Rayonier have been liable or not?</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.315" offset="7056593">If it would, then it follows because the Government's liability is the same as Rayonier's would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.451" offset="7085223">It follows that the Government is liable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2229.458" offset="9021210">When I came to the briefs in the case that's following you, it seemed to me that there was a great question of facts as to what the precise relationship was between the United States and the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.111" offset="9079829">Because your brief as does the brief of your adversaries and particularly in the other case, their reply brief refers to a lot of very long -- a long series of transactions or rather complicated series of transactions, none of them where in record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.957" offset="9151195">There are matters of record apparently in the files but it occurred to me that before you reach -- before you can say that the lower court was right as to Washington Law in relation to the duty of the United States to this easement, there was a question of fact as to whether or not the relationship was that -- of the United States, was that of -- of a grantor of an easement and there was a question of fact that is out there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2294.841" offset="9282748">Well -- well, Your Honor, the -- the briefs here, particularly in the reply brief was on hold, has raised that question emphatically, but I should like to point this out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.285" offset="9328515">That the Court of Appeals construed the allegations of this complaint and the representations of counsel made in their briefs and argument its meaning that the railroad had a railroad easement over the Government lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.912" offset="9411062">As the railroad will -- on the dominant state and the position of the Government was that -- of the holder of a servient interstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.337" offset="9444707">Now, the main thrust of the -- of the arguments in the main briefs of the appellants, both Arnhold and Rayonier presupposed that to be the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.964" offset="9499251">And I might say that no where in this amended complaints that Arnhold file -- filed four of them did they ever say the railroad operated a locomotive on tracks over the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.835" offset="9570722">They alleged throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.931" offset="9579081">They -- they refer throughout their pleadings to a railroad right of way which in all the dictionaries is deemed equivalent to a railroad easement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.274" offset="9616488">Now having alleged there was right of way of the railroad across the Government property they -- they now submit that perhaps that that's wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.855" offset="9666748">Now, they did -- they did query it in the Court of Appeals that the main thrust to their argument there, in their briefs and argument and as it is here was that this was -- certainly, it was a railroad easement of right of way, one of the effects of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.743" offset="9734353">Now obviously, this Court didn't take jurisdiction of these cases to pass on such a question as that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2485.238" offset="10044374">In accordance with your established policy which you would had to in numerous cases of -- of saying that decision of the -- of the Circuit judges particularly as in this case were one of those Circuit judges practiced for 40 years in the State of Washington, Judge Boldt, you should accept that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.098" offset="10135803">Now, the allegations of negligence here are -- are of importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.869" offset="10170807">All of the negligent acts imputed to the Forest Service relate to the quantum of effort in fighting a fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.998" offset="10211349">They are all negative acts of nonfeasance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.749" offset="10230366">There are no affirmative acts at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.130" offset="10243845">They are not even acts as alleged negligence in getting equipment to the scene of the fire or taking up fire truck or a fire automobile having an access on the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.419" offset="10305076">The allegations are that the Forest Service, although they conceive we put out five of these fires, they say the sixth fire got away from us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.299" offset="10348544">And we didn't use enough water and enough equipment and enough men to extinguish that fire before it leaves the plaintiff's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.011" offset="10403401">Now, I'd like to point out, Your Honors, that this is the bedrock of the immunity, public fireman doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.215" offset="10444257">In other words, there has been a distortion of that immunity in many state cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.448" offset="10469125">I think it's been applied too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.911" offset="10479052">It's been applied to some cases to the negligent operation of a fire truck on the way to the scene of a fire, but we are not dealing with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.627" offset="10525863">We're dealing with the quantum of effort which we say should be clearly covered, and why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.562" offset="10553657">Because in the case of every fire, it can be charged if you use 10 men, you should have used 20 men.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.511" offset="10589393">If you use 50 men, you should have been -- used a 100 men.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.643" offset="10605902">And it is true that if we used more men and used more water and used more supplies, that fire would have been put out sooner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.927" offset="10655117">So, liability here on the ground that the immunity principle is inapplicable would mean litigation we think in the case of every fire that these people are fighting daily.</text>
