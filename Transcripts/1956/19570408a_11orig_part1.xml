            <text syncTime="45.102" offset="283773">This case presents the question of whether the United States is entitled, as against the State of Louisiana, to the lands, minerals, and other things underlying the Gulf of Mexico, lying more than three geographic miles seaward from the ordinary low water mark and from the outer limit of inland waters on the Coast of Louisiana and extending seaward to the edge of the Continental Shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.272" offset="400488">It presents the further question of whether United States is entitled to an accounting by the State of Louisiana for all sums of money derived by the State from June 5th, 1950, the date of the opinion of the Court in the other case, from such lands and minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.713" offset="490245">United States alleges in the complaint that it is entitled to a judgment for the property described, lying seaward from the low water mark, inland waters, that the question is res judicata by reason of the prior opinion of the Court, June 1950, and the decree by this Court of December 11th, 1950 that the rights of the United States were modified to the extent of the provisions of the Submerged Lands Act passed by the Congress which gave the States the right to the lands within three miles of the baseline below water -- low water mark or a right to the lands in three leagues but no more in the Gulf of Mexico providing they had a historic boundary for such three leagues in the Gulf of Mexico either at the time they entered the Union or, if it was approved by Act of Congress, on or prior to the passage of the Act on May 22nd, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.173" offset="840077">The United States alleges that it's being interfered with in the operation of the properties in the area described by the State of Louisiana that it does not have any relief -- adequate relief except in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.669" offset="914056">It goes on to describe the nature of the interference, the fact that Louisiana brought an action against the United States in the state courts of Louisiana in which it sought to enjoin the further leasing and development of the area, and that that action was enjoined by this Court and that later, a stipulation was entered into in accordance with the order of this Court whereby the properties might be developed and limited leasing provided for by an agreement filed with this Court until this matter could be determined.</text>

            <text syncTime="250.235" offset="1104332">Louisiana alleges a series of defenses, first, a general denial, and then, supplementary allegations to support that general denial and altogether, eight separate defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.086" offset="1175698">Seven of the defenses, I will deal with later in seriatim as I reach them in the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.284" offset="1216554">The principal defenses in the -- as pertinent to their argument and general denial are, first, that the Submerged Lands Act nullified the decree of this Court by the action of the Congress, in that -- by that congressional act, the Congress interpreted the decree of the Court and determined that, instead of -- of the United States acquiring the property in the manner the Court decreed that it was always the right of the States to have the property which was the subject of the Submerged Lands Act and therefore, they were -- it was less in the nature of a quick claim or a grant but merely giving to the States what they had already had for a period since the beginning of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.465" offset="1473181">They alleged that the restrictions on the state boundaries are unconstitutional, that the territorial boundary included the Continental Shelf, that the State always had a title to the submerged lands, that the boundary of Louisiana always was the same as the United States since the Treaty of Paris of 1803 when we acquired the Louisiana purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.398" offset="1576939">That by the Louisiana Acts of 1938 to 1954, they acquired the right to all of the land in the submerged area from the Cost Guard line to 0.3 leagues beyond that, in the gulf, but they exercise jurisdiction under claims of right since 1949, and they are entitled to judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.177" offset="1704103">The position of the United States is that the judgment and decree of this Court is res judicata as to all of the elements except what was carved out by the Congress in the Submerged Lands Act of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.307" offset="1764603">That there is no genuine issue of fact or of law before this Court at this time in the pleadings presented by the parties, that the Court takes judicial notice of its own decrees of the fact that the political branches of the Government have determined since 1793 that the maritime boundary of the United States is only three miles, three nautical miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.896" offset="1895006">And therefore, no State could possibly have a boundary beyond that of the United State as a maritime boundary on any coast including the gulf.</text>

            <text syncTime="3663.549" offset="14757595">And the Court followed a similar plan in regard to the case of U.S.against California where they decided the question of whether or not this State or the United States was entitled to the submerged area and then reserve the question of where the coastline was to be handled by a special master and his examination of the facts and details.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.689" offset="14862085">And the Government is now asking that the Court pass only upon the question of whether it's three miles or three leagues, and agrees that Louisiana is entitled to have evidence and probably, a special master to develop a question of, assuming it's three miles, where shall it be measured from and where is the proper coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.115" offset="14947871">But we do want to call attention to the fact that the Coast Guard line, the dotted line, has no real relation to the -- what is a proper measure of the coastline under all of the legal holdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.539" offset="15021537">The line was prepared by the commandant of the Coast Guard and it was not made with reference to what the coastline should be or boundary of any State should be, but was made with regard to navigation and navigational aids.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.362" offset="15100844">And it runs along from the point A to D, along the islands here, and then you'll notice it departs at some points in as much as 10 nautical miles away and then on, one-and-a half to six at other points, and it doesn't purport to touch any land for practically the entire distance from about 60 miles over here on the east side of the coast at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.710" offset="15246190">So that, if the Court, in examining this question that we're asking the Court to pass on at this time, would determine whether or not the measure of the maritime belt is three miles or three leagues, and would also decide whether or not the Coast Guard was a proper baseline of which to try to measure the coast, it would be of great help in -- in passing onto the detailed question of the measurement of the coast, which we assume would be done by direction of the Court before a special master in an action similar to what was taken in the case of U.S.against California.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack P.F. Gremillion</label>
            <text syncTime="4914.496" offset="19761403">Mr. Justice Black and Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4919.147" offset="19780002">As Attorney General of the State of Louisiana, I would like to briefly explain to the Court the position of the State in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4927.404" offset="19813021">Incidentally, this is an auspicious day for Louisiana because were admitted to the Union of 145 -- 145 years ago today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4935.891" offset="19846980">So, we are here in a form of a happy birthday, and we hope it will be happy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4942.120" offset="19871848">Our position is plain and it's covered in several simple statements, which I would like to make to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4953.879" offset="19918869">Our argument will be conducted on the motion about -- the argument of Louisiana on the motion against the Federal Government would be conducted by Mr. Scott Wilkinson of Shreveport and Mr. Victor Sachse of Baton Rouge will conclude the State's argument under the arrangement that we have made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4978.221" offset="20016253">But I want to state our position very simply at the outset and that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4984.743" offset="20042376">That, number one, the seaward boundaries of our State are coextensive with the seaward boundaries of the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4993.720" offset="20078216">There is not any federally-owned belt of submerged land seaward of the state-owned submerged land.</text>
            <text syncTime="5002.736" offset="20114265">And while the Congress alone can declare the extent of American territory, and has done so, the ownership of that territory, as distinguished from the imperium respecting it, necessarily is vested in the States pursuant to our constitutional system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5020.534" offset="20185527">And number two, alternatively, and only if the Court should hold that Congress can legally appropriate for the Federal Government a belt of land seaward of the submerged land belonging to and occupied by the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5035.563" offset="20245608">Louisiana claims that its historic boundaries within the meaning of Congressional Acts extend seaward three leagues and not just three miles from its coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="5049.250" offset="20300361">Third, if a state limit is set short of the limit of national territory, the measurement determining the state limit necessarily commences from the coastline and not the shoreline.</text>
            <text syncTime="5062.087" offset="20351770">And the coastline has been declared by Congress to be where inland waters meet the open sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="5069.969" offset="20383222">Fourth, in this particular case, Louisiana has filed a motion to take depositions of various facts or, in the alternative, to have the case transferred to the District Court for such place.</text>
            <text syncTime="5085.496" offset="20445393">Now, the primary problem is the baseline from which Louisiana's boundary is to be measured and that is, whether from Louisiana's coast as the Enabling Act admitting Louisiana provides for are from the shore or whether that measurement is to be three leagues as we plead the Enabling Act also provides or three miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="5112.303" offset="20552600">We believe that the Court might very well conclude that the Enabling Act makes it clear that the baseline is the coast and not the shore, that the measurement is three leagues, not three miles if, indeed, the Court has not rendered all of these unnecessary by deciding that Louisiana is entitled to the entire Continental Shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="5137.016" offset="20651447">But if the Court entertains any doubt as to whether the Congress in 1812 chose the word “coast” instead of “shore” intentionally or whether the Congress in 1812 said “three leagues” intentionally, then in keeping with the mandate of the Congress in the Submerged Lands Act, Louisiana is entitled to produce evidence to show that the implication and the necessary implication and the real meaning of the Enabling Act was and is that Louisiana is to have within its territory all submerged lands within three leagues of its coast as it existed in 1812, 145 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="5180.812" offset="20826572">Now, there is one other matter that I'd like to call the Court's attention to --</text>
