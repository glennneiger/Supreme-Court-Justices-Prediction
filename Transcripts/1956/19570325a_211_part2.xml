            <text syncTime="13.586" offset="157759">Now, I must say in all candor that the congressional history with respect to this subject is very, very confusing indeed.Congress was dealing in this area largely with the objections that had been made that unions cannot be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.876" offset="226826">However, in formulating the legislation which probably in this instance is the most reliable guide it was not confined to suits against unions for damages which is the subject most discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.721" offset="298297">It was as the statute itself plainly indicates, a statute governing suits by one against the other be irrespective of whether the plaintiff was union or defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.751" offset="350333">And in fact, there are community reports in reporting this legislation which indicate that very clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.642" offset="385964">And it would be hard to believe that Congress in enacting a statute of this type would confine itself to a -- a piece of legislation that would operate only on one side of the street.</text>

            <text syncTime="2057.302" offset="8332622">The action sounded in the District Court both as a suit for damages under title 28 and as a request for relief under 301, and as a request for a mandatory injunction and a prohibitory injunction to enforce arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.679" offset="8414124">The District Court, after hearing the parties, found that there was no damage proven and it dismissed that point and continued, however, its jurisdiction under the remainder of the case by directing this company to proceed with the arbitration of grievances as provided under the terms of the expired contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.398" offset="8493014">Now, to us that's extremely significant, if the Court please, because if you take the case in that posture and if you assume the inapplicability of the Norris-LaGuardia Act to this company as an employer, that we can't raise the Norris-LaGuardia Act against injunctive relief directed at us.</text>

            <text syncTime="2244.816" offset="9082650">The -- the Court took into account those facts and they came up with their own version citing the opinion of the three judges which you wrote, sir, as proof of their determination that Congress in enacting 301 had not conferred substantive rights in terms of creating a body of federal common law for enforcement of contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.713" offset="9198216">And in so determining, the Court felt that it must then look to other federal statutes and if there were no other federal statutes to the state law to see if the remedy sought could be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.432" offset="9245132">The Court looked at the Norris-LaGuardia Act and found rather summarily that it did not prohibit the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.425" offset="9273031">It then looked at the Federal Arbitration Act, the United States Arbitration Act and it found -- as this Court found in the Polygraphic case, and I differ with counsel as to why we contend that the Polygraphic case is applicable that the exception in the introductory definitions of the Polygraphic case of the Arbitration Act applied to the whole Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.356" offset="9364773">And to that point, we rely on to the Polygraphic case that the exemption of contracts, seamen and railroad men and other persons engaged in commerce -- I -- I don't have the exact language here -- applied with the whole Act that it wasn't something that applied to section 1 of the Act and not applicable to 2 and 3.</text>

            <text syncTime="2339.468" offset="9461217">The Fifth Circuit undertook to align itself rather strongly with the Fourth Circuit on that point and to disagree rather vigorously with the Third Circuit's interpretations or its later interpretations on that point, pointing out that initially, the Third Circuit had reached the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.580" offset="9537703">The Fifth Circuit then examining -- having examined the Taft-Hartley Act and the United States Arbitration Act, and having found no body of federal common law that should -- that granted the remedy, then felt that it could only apply the law of Alabama which prohibited the remedy and it dismissed the -- it reversed the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.756" offset="9622444">It left open this question which we feel is significant and will -- will continue to be significant in this matter as to the effect of the expiration of the contract upon the demand for arbitration when the contract had expired before arbitration was demanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.657" offset="9694020">Now, going back, if I may, just briefly to legislative history the legislative history of the Taft-Hartley Act indicates as to this point rather little that is specific except two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.765" offset="9762461">In the House, when the bill was in the House, the House Committee bill in its version of what ultimately became 301, referred to any action or proceedings involving a violation of a collective-bargaining contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.321" offset="9836648">And in the same section, the House Committee expressly provided that the provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act would be made inapplicable to an action of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.351" offset="9884818">Now, there's an indication, it seems to us, that the House intended to give equitable remedies or give equitable jurisdiction to the federal courts and to remove the obstacles to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.326" offset="9944691">The Senate on the other hand, dealt with the question primarily and decided to test statement on the floor which was quoted here by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in the -- in his opinion in -- in Westinghouse, expressed the intent of the Senate Committee of being concerned primarily with removing the jurisdictional obstacles to suits against the non-incorporated association for breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.784" offset="10050539">Now, I -- I am certainly in no position to attribute a desire on the part of Congress to take an action of one kind or another or the lack of multilateralism and congressional action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.007" offset="10107382">There's certainly obvious precedent for Congress passing even a one-sided statute to meet an evil that's apparent to Congress or to meet a purpose that it intends to meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.851" offset="10150745">Now, be that as it may, the legislative history of Taft-Hartley certainly contains no basis of assuming that Congress intended for this Court or for itself to write a body of federal common law governing the interpretation of contracts which are all is under the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.184" offset="10220126">These contracts do not arise under the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.178" offset="10232038">The National Labor Relations Act may have some impact upon the obligation to contract, but the terms of the contracts are matters of state law and they're governed by the laws of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.364" offset="10280835">And those States who have -- have seen fit to make them enforceable either by specific performance or to make the agreements the arbitrative, irrevocable have enacted statutes to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.325" offset="10328691">And there are statutes to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.560" offset="10337573">Case is cited by counsel in its reply brief on -- on the question of irrevocability of arbitration all arise under the New York Statute which expressly so provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.760" offset="10378428">Alabama on the other hand, has not elected to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.208" offset="10392221">And we submit that Congress did not elect to write such a provision for Alabama, it -- to govern it in the interpretation of a type of contract arising under the law of that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.433" offset="10437151">Now, as to the applicability of Norris-LaGuardia, I say their point lead to the Court that the Fifth Circuit, not only was not impressed with the argument, but dealt with it very summarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.831" offset="10506742">And we do not argue as such that the Norris-LaGuardia Act prohibits the federal court from granting some relief under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.808" offset="10574555">But we do argue that the Norris-LaGuardia Act's prohibitions against granting equitable relief under the Taft-Hartley Act and because of the Taft-Hartley Act were expressly kept active by the Congress because whatever Congress wrote in injunctive or equitable relief in the Taft-Hartley, and provided for it, it also expressly provided for a non-applicability of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.351" offset="10680822">And in this instance, it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.499" offset="10693360">And it may not be said in the light of the legislative history that the -- the application or the impact of Norris-LaGuardia was unknown or not considered by the Congress because the House expressly injected it in the House Bill.</text>

            <text syncTime="2733.817" offset="11038595">Yet here we are -- are confronted with an argument asking us to embody that into a -- an implied federal code of substantive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.970" offset="11079241">Our answer to it is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.583" offset="11085720">That Congress is not without the means or the knowledge or the capacity to impose a code of federal substantive law if it sees fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.709" offset="11130232">But it was perfectly obvious from the history of the whole Labor Relations Program beginning with the United States Arbitration Act that the policy of Congress was against imposing such a code except in the limited fields that it specified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.498" offset="11193344">The labor opposition to compulsory arbitration is that whether it has been changed by their position in this matter is a matter of economic and American history and certainly something that Congress was well aware of.</text>

            <text syncTime="2845.745" offset="11486333">As a matter of fact, when counsel was talking, I happened to have with me a short excerpt from a discussion by Senator Murray on the floor of the Senate in which he was expressing some opposition to the provisions of 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.625" offset="11545893">And in his dissertation he pointed out that 301 provided that the federal courts would be burdened with interpreting state law on the applicability of contracts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2951.748" offset="11910353">Now, on the United States Arbitration Act, if I may proceed to that there again, one must not only read in to a statute what is not there but must read into the legislative history a complete reversal of what the legislative history says the purpose of the statute was to make it applicable to this or the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.694" offset="12038144">It seems to me that if there's a clear legislative history, it's the legislative history of the United States Arbitration Act that it did not intend to make it applicable to agreements involving industrial disputes of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.574" offset="12097703">Now, the argument that in 1925, they were talking about contract to arbitration rather than grievance arbitration and that sort of thing is all very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.153" offset="12156008">But to come to the conclusion that the United States Arbitration Act provides the federal remedy here in the face of its language and its history, requires that this Court not only look at the legislative history but reverse it and to come up with a conclusion exactly contrary to what Congress said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.293" offset="12232495">Now, it can't be argued, it seems to me, that the American Federation of Labor, even in 1925, did not know the difference between a collective agreement and an individual contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.296" offset="12284531">And that it did not know the difference between agreements covering seamen as the reference is made to the president of Seamen's Union and collective agreements which weren't in existence at that time when there were collective-bargaining agreements in effect in 1925 in a number of industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.852" offset="12354748">And yet the American Federation of Labor specifically opposed the bill and insisted upon the inclusion of language exempting industrial disputes from its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.921" offset="12395081">And Congress went along.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.989" offset="12399365">Congress agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.889" offset="12402918">The Secretary of Commerce recommended the change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.648" offset="12413994">And the bill was changed accordingly and enacted that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.380" offset="12428936">And the only decision of any court prior to its reenactment in the judicial court, the Galland case expressly held that that was the -- the intent of Congress and so ruled and Congress reenacted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.546" offset="12485569">Now, to say that the United States Arbitration Act may now be stretched beyond its intent, its language, and its congressional purpose, to at this stage in contradiction to its legislative history cover -- provide the -- the substantive basis for a judicial code or a federal labor code that Congress didn't see fit to write seems to me to -- to request this Court to simply legislate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.114" offset="12595806">There just isn't any basis of interpretation or anything else it can be sustained, we submit in the face of that legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.150" offset="12631960">Our final point is one that I mentioned at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.621" offset="12645857">And that is the point of whether or not a federal court may require an employer to submit to final and binding arbitration matters governing the operation of his business which the petitioners concede are a sort of mutuality for the agreement not to strike when the no-strike clause is no longer effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.224" offset="12772289">Now, in effect, the District Court extended the life of this contract through the date of arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.630" offset="12797889">If he extended it only insofar as this company is concerned, it did not extend it insofar as the union is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.859" offset="12822758">It couldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.823" offset="12830699">And while the Circuit Court did not reach the question, we think it is -- it is extremely significant because it's an indication of the fallacy, if you -- if the Court please, of this alleged distinction between grievance and contract arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.110" offset="12899767">The line is so interwoven and the area is so commingling that except in the rather obvious case of conceivably a discharge in reinstatement, the grievance process as an extension, as some of the experts call it of the collective-bargaining process, is in and of itself a writing of contracts and a writing and implementing and an expansion of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.460" offset="13009168">So that I think that the -- the purported distinction that counsel seeks to draw between contract and grievance arbitration is not a substantial difference because the areas intermingle and in various places the area is gray rather than black and white.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.242" offset="13076355">Now, if the Court please, we submit that the decision of the Fifth Circuit or the majority of the Fifth Circuit is a correct decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.911" offset="13103000">That 301 did not, by its language or by the intent of Congress, vest in the federal courts the right to impose a federal rule requiring the arbitration of an -- of the enforcement of an executory agreement to arbitrate in the face of state law which expressed therein clearly prohibits the enforcement of such agreement.</text>
