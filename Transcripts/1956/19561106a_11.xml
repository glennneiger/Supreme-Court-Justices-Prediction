            <text syncTime="7.875" offset="134875">When the Court recessed yesterday, I believe I had completed discussing the -- the jurisdiction of the court below to do what it did in this case, the power of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.522" offset="189419">I should now like -- like to address myself to the merits of what the court below did.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.840" offset="214706">The first thing that the court below did was to strike down Counts I and II of the Iowa suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.434" offset="253158">We think that there -- that there can be no doubt about the proper use of discretion in doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.640" offset="281893">The Court did it on the ground that those two Counts clearly violate Article IV of the decree which had to judge these patent licenses to be illegal, null and void.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.024" offset="335496">And being illegal, null and void, the Court said that you could not bring suit upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.453" offset="361200">The Court did not say as Judge Bromley intimated yesterday or said yesterday that these two Counts were struck down because of fresh misuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.535" offset="401533">They were not, and I shall ask Your Honors to look at the conclusion in a few moments with respect to those two Counts, they were struck down not because they were brought, they were struck down because they flew directly in the face of the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.783" offset="470497">And the United States Government is very much interested in this and said below contrary to what Judge Bromley said -- said below and repeat here that they are very much interested in protecting the decree and therefore, they joined with us not only in sustaining the jurisdiction of the Court but in the exercise of its discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="236.426" offset="1049057">The court -- the court below did the -- took the same position.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.098" offset="1067760">But with respect to Counts I and II, the position that it took was that they were to be barred for reasons of -- by reason of the fact that they had been specifically barred by the decree below.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.571" offset="1125648">They also barred them on other Counts, as I shall show.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.249" offset="1140381">Now, there can be no ambiguity about what the declaration illegal, null and void means.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.201" offset="1168175">And all of the exposition of Judge Bromley yesterday and in his brief talking about what the lawyers claimed when -- before the decree was finally signed, what illegal, null and void meant is entirely beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.240" offset="1232332">This was not a consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.047" offset="1239542">This was a litigated decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.323" offset="1248632">And every lawyer there was speaking for his own client.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.466" offset="1261275">Dallstream was talking for his client Celotex who isn't here before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.616" offset="1281860">Mr. Finck was talking for National Gypsum.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.658" offset="1293981">And what these lawyers said about what was going to be in the decree was something which the Court listened to and then made up its own mind what was going to be put into the decree and what the Court put into the decree was that language that each and every one of these patent licenses is illegal, null and void.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.463" offset="1373184">There can be nothing less ambiguous than that declaration, and USG is hard put to it toward to explain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.606" offset="1405785">In the court below and in fact, during the entire course of this original litigation through the various courts, it took the position that these patent license agreements were perfectly legal each in itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.468" offset="1465240">And what they said was that all that this Court had determined was that the plurality of the licenses, the fact that there were so many is what made them illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.036" offset="1503483">That isn't what this Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.902" offset="1511006">It isn't what the District Court said originally, and it isn't what the District Court says now.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.411" offset="1533053">It said that every one of this was illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.071" offset="1547682">Now, in the court below, as I say, Judge Bromley made the argument that they were legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.653" offset="1569938">And in page 78 of our brief, we quote him as to what he said below.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.600" offset="1589791">In the footnote, in the brief answering the petitioner's briefs, he said that each individual license agreement in this case constituted a valid and binding contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.806" offset="1638588">That was his position below.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.139" offset="1647888">Obviously, he doesn't make the same flat assertion here but what he has tried to argue yesterday that all illegal, null and void meant was that the license agreements were going to be canceled.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.815" offset="1702640">Now, it's quite clear that illegal, null and void does not mean that sometime in the future we're going to cancel.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.756" offset="1734405">They mean illegal, null and void, and I might add that it wasn't until the reply brief in this case that USG shifted its ground from the saying that each of them was illegal and shifted its ground to say that all they meant was that they were to be canceled.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.864" offset="1806817">So I think we need not carry much longer on Counts I and II.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.375" offset="1824893">When we come to Counts III, IV and V, Judge Bromley advances a novel proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.718" offset="1858226">Count III was described by the court below as an indebitatus assumpsit count, Count IV was a quantum meruit, and Count V is the action for infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.555" offset="1917576">Now, what did the court below do with respect to these Counts?</text>
            <text syncTime="457.731" offset="1934294">It definitely and unequivocally barred them all.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.985" offset="1955297">It barred them on three separate grounds, not on one ground, as Judge Bromley what had you -- have you believed.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.174" offset="1992077">It barred them on three separate grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.684" offset="2006079">Each one was an alternative ground, each one, we maintain, was a proper ground, and each one was sufficient on which they found its conclusion that these Iowa suits should be barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.601" offset="2073788">Now, Judge Bromley in his argument yesterday, as I say, advanced this proposition, which he has never advanced before to the effect, and I quote him on page 14 in response to Mr. Justice Brennan's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.092" offset="2143692">Justice Brennan, "Did it have any other basis than this ground, that is the fresh misuse involved in bringing the Iowa action?"</text>
            <text syncTime="519.582" offset="2181726">Mr. Bromley, "I think -- I don't think it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.429" offset="2197086">I think it asserted that some of the allegations of misuse had been proved although they had not been."</text>
            <text syncTime="529.504" offset="2221432">There is a conflict, I think, and a little doubt as to what they did decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.250" offset="2240345">But my position is all they decided, as a matter of law, was the bringing of the suit was enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.150" offset="2272005">Justice Frankfurter at that point said -- I'm sorry, I withdraw that.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.891" offset="2290918">On page 30, he was even more unequivocal than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.023" offset="2311502">What he said was, "Now, therefore, it is clear from conclusions 7 and 13 of the court below, which appear at record 1156, conclusions 7 and 13, if, in 1953, we had not pleaded Counts on the old licenses -- on the old license agreement, the 1951 decree," I think he meant 1954 decree, "would not have barred compensation suits based on the other Counts".</text>
            <text syncTime="582.577" offset="2433651">That is the second paragraph of the Conclusion 7."</text>
            <text syncTime="585.793" offset="2446503">If we had not pleaded those Counts, then the Court, as it did, would hold that the other Counts were not barred by the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.850" offset="2486732">I further think it is clear that if we had not pleaded those Counts, we would not have been deemed to have misused our patents from 1948 to 1953," referring again to the same record.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.165" offset="2540022">And finally, "If we had not pleaded those Counts, I think it is clear from those conclusions, the Court would not have modified the final decree."</text>
            <text syncTime="618.146" offset="2575966">At which point, Justice Frankfurter said, "It strikes me a strange."</text>
            <text syncTime="621.791" offset="2590490">And it also strikes us a strange because it just isn't true.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.163" offset="2608044">That is not true as to what the Court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.155" offset="2619956">It involves a misconception of what the court below did of so fundamental in nature that I would ask Your Honors' indulgence to turn to the conclusions of law in this case which we --</text>

            <text syncTime="657.734" offset="2734268">There are 16 conclusions of law, as Your Honors will see beginning on page 1155.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.234" offset="2760286">The first 10 of them have to do mainly with the jurisdiction of the court below and with Counts I and II.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.908" offset="2794977">The final six of them beginning with number 11, set forth the basis of the Court's decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.477" offset="2829249">May I respectfully direct your attention to number 11 in which the Court said that the course of conduct of USG has clearly shown by the proceedings of record in the antitrust case, that's the case in which Your Honors passed on twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.068" offset="2895600">And then these suits by USG established that USG did not purge itself of its patent misuse at any time prior to May 15th, 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.134" offset="2943875">Now, that was the date of the decree so that the Court here was talking about the prior misuse, which was the basis of the 1951 decree, the unpurged misuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.887" offset="2994970">It wasn't talking about the misuse which had alleged occurred when the Iowa suits were brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.226" offset="3020257">And the Court went on to say that the acts -- the five acts claimed by USG to constitute acts of purge prior to May 15th do not constitute purge.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.251" offset="3064351">Now, whenever they talk about purge, they are talking about the old misuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.857" offset="3082846">They couldn't be talking about purge, as Justice Frankfurter pointed out yesterday with respect to the new actions because obviously, there's no purge there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1540.845" offset="6266755">It is our position that they could not possibly show that the evil effects of this conspiracy had been terminated until the final decree was signed, at least until the final decree was signed because this Court said that any prior decree was insufficient to meet that test of dissipating the evil effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.958" offset="6363199">The original decree of 1949 came up here on appeal by the Government to expand.</text>

            <text syncTime="2002.717" offset="8114239">Yes, sir, and we cover that very -- very carefully in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.582" offset="8129703">We say that the court below should not have been put to the necessity of having a hearing on the question of purge unless something was indicated to them to indicate to -- to show what a hearing was to be held about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.180" offset="8188113">Now, all that they did below was to say that there are some five facts, which apparently I do not have time to go into, there were some five facts, not new facts, but five facts in the old record which we claim constitute purge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.270" offset="8248404">The court below said they do not constitute purge even if they're true, even if you can prove those five facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.413" offset="8281004">They are not adequate in law to constitute purge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2049.620" offset="8301902">And if I had time, I would discuss each of these five facts to show that even if proved, they do not meet the test of purge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.938" offset="8335130">So then, we contend that it was up to USG to say, "If you don't think those constitute purge, then we have the following evidence which we would like to submit to you to have a hearing on because we think we can prove purge."</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.297" offset="8400541">Now, this Court said in its second opinion in this case that the court below didn't have to waste its time that it could regulate the procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2671.739" offset="10790327">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.356" offset="10800776">Certain-teed, like National Gypsum, was a petitioner in the District Court and is an appellee here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.178" offset="10832123">We filed a separate brief in this Court but the position of Certain-teed on this appeal is in all respects the same as National.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.046" offset="10875591">We agreed to the use of all but a few minutes of the time by Judge Rosenman who would present the views of National which naturally because of our position as licensees of USG also defendants originally, petitioners below and appellees here is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.945" offset="10955107">There'd be no purpose served in my repeating the matters which Judge Rosenman has presented in his argument and which are fully covered in the briefs filed by Certain-teed and National.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.996" offset="11003382">However, I'd like to devote a few minutes I have to emphasizing the following points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.529" offset="11033475">The first have to do with the reference of Mr. Bromley to the fact that all that we had below was two days of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.892" offset="11082898">Now, in examination of the District Court's opinion of July 1954, which was entered a month and something, a year and three months after the first petition had been filed in that Court and after lengthy argument after many briefs had been filed would indicate quite clearly that the District Court had made a painstaking examination of the whole antitrust litigation and the record in those cases, and a voluminous record it was, had made an examination of the numerous authority cited to it, had listened to all the arguments, and had passed upon the matters presented to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.209" offset="11236185">Again, it did that similar thing in the motion for a new trial and for rehearing so that it would seem that the -- the statement that all that Mr. Bromley's client had was two days of argument would be refuted by the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.367" offset="11292818">Now, nowhere during all of that time did Mr. Bromley, on behalf of his client, make any proffer of the various matters he offered to prove which brings me to the next point and that is that letter of July 8, 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.237" offset="11356348">The letter first came into this -- the hearing before the District Court as result of the five so-called facts of purge urged by Mr. Bromley.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.661" offset="11402010">He referred to the facts that there has been a finding that they had ceased fixing prices in July 8, 1941 but had failed inadvertently, I assume, to the reach -- to say that that same letter or that same notice had contained this reservation that they retain the right to fix the prices at any time they desire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.057" offset="11491558">In the District Court, no argument was ever made by Mr. Bromley in reply to our reference to that letter and that reservation of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.222" offset="11524263">In fact, his argument before the District Court shows clearly that he admitted it but said that as a matter of law that reservation didn't change their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.299" offset="11564596">Now, with regard to Mr. Dallstream's statement, I believe Judge Rosenman has answered that completely except for one -- one point which I wish to point out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.634" offset="11609945">The fact that lawyer has said great many things before the decree was entered wouldn't affect the determination by this Court of what the decree meant and by the District Court of what its own decree meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.241" offset="11648293">However, as the footnotes in our brief and in Mr. -- and in National's brief at pages 48 and 49 and 50, respectively, show Mr. Dallstream specifically stated there were differences of opinion between counsel for the various petitioners and licensees and that he spoke for himself and that's also evidenced by Mr. Bromley's quotation from what Mr. Dallstream had to say when he said that in order that USG will have no misunderstanding of my position that my suggestion is in no way based on the desire or hope on my part to avoid these royalty payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.882" offset="11810879">Finally, I would like to say that it is not true and Mr. Bromley intimated that the Government said as to Counts III, IV &amp; V, it was a private affair between private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.123" offset="11863855">Therefore, the Government's petition in its brief clearly showed that it considered this matter of great interest that it felt as to Counts I and II, the -- and the suits filed by USG that they were applauding of this Court's decree and though they took no position, they never made any further statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.667" offset="11934072">And I just wish to add finally that in this Court, the Government's position has changed to refute that remark completely, and I think it's a fair statement to say that the Government is now neutral on our side.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bruce Bromley</label>
            <text syncTime="2975.507" offset="12005439">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.047" offset="12011604">Yesterday, in answer to a question by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I may have given the impression that this appeal involves a bottom only an interpretation of Article IV of the 1951 final decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.680" offset="12058102">That is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.684" offset="12066147">Now that Article IV of that decree has been construed by the court below as nullifying the old license agreements as sources of rights, as I understand it, for either party in the compensation suits either by way of affirmative claim or defense, USG can accept and rely upon that adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.225" offset="12152247">That adjudication is the first paragraph of Conclusion 7 at record 1156.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.584" offset="12173667">But as I said yesterday, the court below has also concluded that the 1951 decree did not expressly or by implication bar suits by USG for quantum meruit or infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.735" offset="12226330">That is the second paragraph of Conclusion 7 at record 1156.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.299" offset="12252557">Thus, in those areas, neither the judgment below enjoining the USG suits for quantum meruit or infringement nor this appeal are concerned with interpreting the 1951 decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.058" offset="12307623">This appeal is directed to the conclusion of the court below that we misused our patents in the 1948-1951 period, and that therefore, the right of USG to seek compensation on any theory should be enjoined by supplementing the injunctive reach of the 1951 decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.257" offset="12392364">Now, I should like to refer to those alleged misuses that Judge Rosenman yesterday and today asserts and tell the court below to make the modification of the decree that it did make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.279" offset="12440534">He says the court below found two basic misuses, the fresh misuse, that is the bringing of the compensation suits, and secondly, and now more importantly, he says, and I quote him, "The misuse which Your Honors have twice found pervaded this entire industry and had been used by USG to regimen and organize the industry to refrain production."</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.744" offset="12530395">And he gives illustrations of price fixing on unpatented goods and the elimination of jobbers and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.683" offset="12558085">Now, I submit that such a definition of this alleged second misuse makes it clear that Judge Rosenman is speaking of a misuse which on this record can have occurred no later than 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.870" offset="12614823">This Court's rulings related to a complaint filed in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.561" offset="12629661">As I've said repeatedly, there was no evidence concerning anything after 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.670" offset="12650036">That's why I said yesterday, he must rely upon a legal fiction to bring that down to the 1948-1951 period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.820" offset="12678666">And as has been said many times, we denied that in our answers at record 788 and 789.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.038" offset="12711476">Now, even if misuse proved to have been a fact in or before 1940 can as a matter of law be presumed to have continued into the 1948-1951 period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.084" offset="12755675">The fact remains that we've never been allowed an opportunity to rebut that presumption by the submission of evidence extrinsic of the record in the old antitrust case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.388" offset="12792874">It was in connection with this claim which we made for an opportunity to be heard that we call to the Court's attention certain facts already of record before it which we contended not only prevented any summary ruling of unpurged misuse but transferred the burden to the corporate appellees of proving prima facie at least that the patent misuses which they alleged had been indulged in by us -- us during the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3464.915" offset="13963055">And in -- in that connection, the ground rules were laid down, I submit, that it was made perfectly clear and made clear by Judge Rosenman himself that the Court was to approach the matter to see if it could be decided as a matter of law and then we were to be given a hearing if it felt it couldn't because on page 676 of the record, if you please, Judge Rosenman said this to the Court at the very outset before we'd had any discussion, "We brought this petition, sirs, in two claims."</text>

            <text syncTime="3516.245" offset="14168377">Under claim number two, there will be questions of fact perhaps.</text>

            <text syncTime="3523.327" offset="14196694">He explains on the next page, 678, what he means by "perhaps".</text>

            <text syncTime="3529.584" offset="14221667">And he said, of course, if we answer, then there will be questions of fact because Judge Stevens, on page 678 of the record, said to him, "In determining these questions of fact, will there be witnesses or documentary evidence or what?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.579" offset="14289690">And Judge Rosenman's answer said that that would depend upon whether we deny the alleged misuse in the 1948-1951 period set forth in paragraph (21) of the National petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.514" offset="14341413">I -- I think he conceded that if we denied it, there would be questions of fact upon which testimony went farther.</text>
