            <label>Mr. George W. Crockett, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="15.308" offset="61231">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.110" offset="84428">The petitioner here is a 48-year old woman who is employed as a waitress in a restaurant herein to the working class people in the City of Detroit.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.879" offset="143464">She knows practically nothing about the Constitution or the Fifth Amendment except perhaps what she has seen on TV or what her attorney told her in connection with this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.863" offset="199367">The attorney, judging from the record, was not too experienced himself with the interpretations of the Fifth Amendment, and there are certain definite areas of misjudgment, I would say, that will immediately occur to the Court as you examine this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.326" offset="289228">The judge who tried the case, with a very recent appointee to our District Court bench, I am not too sure but what this was not his first contested trial and I am sure this was the first time he was called on to exercise the drastic power of criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.211" offset="368744">Now, it was this combination of circumstances which gave rise to the case that we have before us today, our case which, in my humble opinion, never should have been in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.004" offset="427990">I recall when I first appear before this Court, I think it was Mr. Justice Frankfurter who made the comment to me that sometimes justice is the appearance of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.452" offset="481802">And later in Offutt against United States, I believe the majority opinion repeats that very appropriate statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.222" offset="516807">I entered this case in the appeal stage and I conceive it to be my function to suggest possible reasons in law by which this Court might right the injustice that occurred in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.866" offset="587442">Of course, I am assuming that the Court agrees with me that there has been an injustice and it's incumbent upon me to point that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.153" offset="616594">Now, as to the facts, the petitioner was born in Poland.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.324" offset="645224">She migrated to the United States at the age of two in 1911.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.880" offset="671451">She has lived in the United States ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.433" offset="689633">Her formal education seized with the seventh grade at which time she was 15 years old and she had to go to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.413" offset="729652">I think the record clearly indicates that throughout her life, she has identified herself with so-called oppressed people in our social order and particularly with the members of the working class.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.565" offset="794227">Her testimony admits that during her youth and during the period of the Depression, this identification was so-called oppressed causes led her to become a member of the Young Communist League, which, I understand, was the junior section of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.618" offset="878446">She denies that she was ever a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.295" offset="897149">Also in her youth, she married a man, who, I believe the record bears us out, was a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.853" offset="931318">And in January 1935, her husband was expelled from the Communist Party and it was at that time that she ceased to be active in the Young Communist League.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.523" offset="990041">In 1946, she made application for citizenship under the provisions of the Nationality Act of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.312" offset="1033195">That Act prohibited the naturalization of anyone who, within the period of 10 years prior to his application, had been a member of any organization teaching anarchy or the disbelief in organized government.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.852" offset="1115324">Petitioner, in the course of her naturalization process, did not reveal that she had been a member of the Young Communist League.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.860" offset="1155344">As a matter of fact, when she registered in 1940 under the Alien Registration Act, there was a question there that inquired what organizations have you belonged to in the past five years, and she did not indicate in answering that question that she had been a member of the Young Communist League.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.317" offset="1233189">Now, come the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 which permits the revocation of naturalization wherever the Government is able to show a willful misrepresentation or concealment of a material fact, the Government filed its complaint for denaturalization in the District Court at Detroit.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.926" offset="1327647">The essence of that complaint is that petitioner was guilty of a fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.450" offset="1345724">In that, in her application for citizenship and in the processes leading up to the grant of citizenship, she had not revealed her former affiliation with the Young Communist League and with the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.720" offset="1406851">Now, that case came on to be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.770" offset="1419076">And here, we see the first error of judgement, I believe, that was made by a trial counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.392" offset="1441541">Since denaturalization is a civil proceeding, the Government was permitted under the rules to call the defendant to the stand as a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.241" offset="1484904">The course of the Government's examination, both the dependent and her counsel made it abundantly clear that with respect to all of the questions relating to her organizational affiliations that were limited in point of time to the period prior to her 1946 naturalization, she would answer those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.941" offset="1575706">But as to the organizational affiliations subsequent to 1946, she would rely upon her privilege under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.965" offset="1615830">There is, I believe, a rational basis for that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.949" offset="1631713">Certainly, this Court has held in the (Inaudible) case that questions intended to elicit from a witness an admission of membership in the Communist Party are questions which might tend to incriminate into that extent the privilege is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.793" offset="1691167">It is also true, however, that with respect to a showing of a possible offense which is outlawed by the statute of limitations as certainly a Smith Act offense predicate upon activity prior to 1946 would be outlawed, the privilege would not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.727" offset="1758877">So as I say, there was a sound legal basis from making that distinction, the trial court was aware of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.023" offset="1784059">And throughout petitioner's examination under the rule, the trial court recognized her right to the protection of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.990" offset="1823869">At the conclusion of petitioner's examination under the rule, her attorney requested leave to delay her cross-examination until after the Government had completed its case in sheet.</text>

            <text syncTime="476.239" offset="1904953">Rather than to call her as his own witness, she was a witness for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.822" offset="1923239">And under the rule, even her own attorney was entitled to cross-examine her with respect to the testimony she had given while she was on the stand as a witness for the Government.</text>

          <turn speaker="george_w_crockett_jr" startTime="494.424" stopTime="817.266">
            <label>Mr. George W. Crockett, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="494.424" offset="1977678">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.754" offset="1978932">I say he requested permission to delay his cross-examination until after the Government had completed its case in sheet.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.962" offset="2019788">The trial court denied that request.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.035" offset="2036088">Now, at that point, counsel for the petitioner had a choice of either to go on with this cross-examination at that time when it was abundantly clear that there could be no subsequent contention that there was a waiver by taking the stand or he could excuse the petitioner and recall her as his own witness after the Government rested.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.330" offset="2129293">I think it was an error in tactics, trial tactics that he didn't proceed with his cross-examination at that time because, as I examined the record, there isn't one thing that he was able to bring out on her direct examination as his own witness that he could not have brought out by cross-examining her while she was a witness for the Government, perhaps the first one of these errors that has given rise to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.916" offset="2239634">Petitioner was excused from the stand and the Government subsequently produced two, possibly three witnesses, all of whom, I believe I am correct in saying, fall in the category of paid informers that are frequently used by the Government in denaturalization proceedings in that particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.290" offset="2317061">Their testimony was to the effect that petitioner not only had been a member of the Young Communist League but that she had been a member of the Communist Party and they brought that period of membership up to a point subsequent to the date of her naturalization in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.728" offset="2390831">At the conclusion of the Government's case, petitioner's counsel then called petitioner as his witness and there is no question in the record that that's precisely what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.633" offset="2438478">As a matter of fact, there was some colloquy with the Court and the Court made sure that the record reflected the fact that petitioner was now taking the stand as a witness called back her own counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.785" offset="2487066">And now, we come to the second tactical error made by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.050" offset="2508173">Knowing that the Court would prepare to go along with his view that the privilege could be claimed with respect to all questions that were limited -- let me begin that again.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.017" offset="2568046">Knowing that the Court was prepared to go along with his view that the privilege was available with respect to the membership prior to 1946 or alleged Communist Party activity prior to 1946, he tried, in the course of his examination of his client, to limit his questions to that period but he made one or two mistakes in such a limitation and they are in the record, and I have set them forth in a footnote in our main brief and I believe it appears on pages 5 to 6, certain questions that he put to her as his witness which were not limited in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.936" offset="2727706">Take for example this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.083" offset="2736274">Referring to her petition for naturalization which she already had identified and it said that she answered the questions as therein stated, counsel asked her “In question 28, you were asked "Are you a believer in anarchy or the unlawful damage, injury or destruction of property or sabotage?"</text>
            <text syncTime="703.581" offset="2814224">And you answered, "No."</text>
            <text syncTime="705.550" offset="2822165">"Was that a true answer to that question?”</text>
            <text syncTime="708.924" offset="2835644">And the witness then answered, “That was the true answer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="712.000" offset="2847974">And then counsel said, “You say it was not only a true answer at that time, you filed the petition July 16th, 1946, and is that the true answer today?”</text>
            <text syncTime="723.586" offset="2894263">So he's coming down to a period subsequent to 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.620" offset="2910459">And there are two or three other instances in which the same error of judgement has made and it is that error of judgement that is relied upon by the Court of Appeals in affirming the conviction below.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.555" offset="2962181">Now, after petitioner had completed her direct examination as a witness called by her own counsel, the Government was entitled to cross-examine and the first question put to her on cross-examination was, "Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?"</text>
            <text syncTime="760.501" offset="3041907">With respect to the portion of that question that has to do with "Have you ever been?"</text>
            <text syncTime="764.231" offset="3056849">Obviously, that had been answered because when she was a witness for the Government, she had categorically denied that she'd ever been a member of the Communist Party not withstanding she had admitted membership in the Young Communist League.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.988" offset="3107944">It is the other part of the question, “Are you now,” of course perhaps a part of the second half or, “have you ever been a member?”</text>
            <text syncTime="785.018" offset="3140023">Because that portion certainly related to the period subsequent to 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.092" offset="3164264">As to that, the petitioner claimed her privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.678" offset="3178684">The trial court ruled and I think it's pretty clear that she had waived the protection of the Fifth Amendment by voluntarily taking the stand as a witness in her own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.813" offset="3231242">I recalled when I argued this case before, Mr. Justice Whittaker raised the question whether or not it was really correct to say that that was a basis of the trial court's ruling.</text>

            <text syncTime="824.320" offset="3297280">Yours was the first question, and I'll always remember that.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.383" offset="3313476">If you will examine the transcript at pages 33 to 34 and again at page 40, you will see that the trial court was most specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.432" offset="3349629">It was his view that the rule with respect to the waiver in criminal cases should also apply in civil cases and that as soon as a person voluntarily takes the stand in a civil case, these is a waiver of the Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.709" offset="3422772">Now, the Court of Appeals did not uphold the trial court in that calling nor did it disagree with the trial court in that holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.187" offset="3460702">Instead, the Court of Appeals said regardless of whether or not there was a waiver when she took the stand, there was a waiver based on her prior testimony that having undertaken to speak concerning the question of organization or affiliations on her direct examination, she was compelled then to submit to cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.117" offset="3552444">In effect then, what the Court of Appeals is saying is that we must apply in our interpretation of the Fifth Amendment the same rule that is customarily applied in the law of evidence that whatever doors are open on direct examination remain open for purposes of questioning on cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.736" offset="3638857">That, I submit, has never been the rule of this Court and I rely on this Court's opinion in the Arndstein cases that are cited in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.215" offset="3688803">I don't want to take the time to review that facts in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.030" offset="3704059">I do want to point out that certainly, when the same question is presented to this Court on four different occasions between the same litigants and the Court adheres to its ruling, the Court must be convinced of the correctness of that ruling.</text>

            <text syncTime="953.089" offset="3812310">The ruling in Arndstein was to this effect that in a civil proceeding, a witness or a fraud defendant, who takes the stand whether voluntarily or involuntarily, does not waive the privilege under the Fifth Amendment unless and until he even admits guilt or gives clear proof of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.762" offset="3918994">Now, that was the holding in the Arndstein case.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.603" offset="3938325">I'm reminded at this point at the time of my last argument, I think it was Mr. Justice Brennan who questioned me about the Arndstein case and gave me a hypothetical case that really carries Arndstein to its outermost limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.703" offset="3994749">It was suggested that I consider the case of two automobile drivers not accompanied with passengers going in opposite directions down the highway and colliding with the result that one driver is killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.558" offset="4050129">The other driver brings a suit against the administrator of the estate of the deceased driver, he takes the witness stand, he gives his version of how the accident occurred and of course, it's a one-sided version.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.694" offset="4102687">On cross-examination, he was asked certain questions, I presume a possible answer to which might show him guilty of negligent homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.635" offset="4138527">And so, he relies upon his privilege under the Fifth Amendment and refuses to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.410" offset="4161620">The justice asked me under those circumstances should he be permitted to go to the jury on his one-sided version of the case, and my answer was that if we apply the Arndstein rule as this Court announced that rule, he would be entitled to go to the jury on even that one-sided version of the case to which, if I'm not mistaken, Mr. Justice Brennan indicate that he thought it was most unfair and then the Chief Justice inquired if it was necessary to go that far in this case and I answered no without elaborating upon my note.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.972" offset="4303830">I want to suggest that in such cases, certainly the state courts have found a way of taking care of a situation without depriving the Fifth Amendment of its effectiveness in that type of situation because the state cases many of them hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.775" offset="4379063">And under those circumstances, the trial court has justified in striking that portion of the direct testimony which, because of the invocation of the Fifth Amendment, is not subjected to cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.921" offset="4431621">I want to suggest that the Court might wish, in its opinion in this case, to consider at least amending the Arndstein rule to the extent to confirm the authority of the Federal District Courts to do essentially the same thing where an attempt to reconcile the constitutional right to rely upon the Fifth Amendment conflicts with the constitutional right to cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.444" offset="4533708">Now, leaving for the moment the lower court's decision in Arndstein or before leaving it, I do want to make one additional point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.820" offset="4575190">There is basis, I think, to conclude from the examination of this record that trial counsel for the petitioner in this case as well as the petitioner was really misled by the trial court's rulings because when you examine the record, you will find that there were several instances for the trial court sustain the claim of the Fifth Amendment or held that there had not been a waiver not withstanding the witness that answered previous questions that were not limited in time to the period prior to 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.616" offset="4734433">For example, the witness was asked concerning certain individuals who were -- were well-known in the area to be members of the Communist Party and who were expected to be witnesses in this particular case, she was asked if she knew a person whose name was -- pardon me, Virgil Stewart or Bernice Baldwin or Earl Reno.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.272" offset="4813009">Now, those questions were not limited in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.238" offset="4820950">She wasn't asked, “Did you know them before 1946?</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.289" offset="4833071">Just, "Did you know them?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.607" offset="4842371">And with respect to those questions, she answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.728" offset="4854909">Now, if we apply the rule which the Court of Appeals later applied, we would have to conclude from that that she had opened the door by answering the questions with respect to her associations or knowledge and so forth of these individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.002" offset="4911961">And to that extent, she had waived the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.325" offset="4921260">The trial court, however, and I think it's clear, was attempting to apply the rule in Arndsted -- in Arndstein rather and was saying that while she could have claimed the privilege with respect to those questions under the theory that an answer might tend to incriminate her, the fact that she did not claim the privilege did not amount to a waiver because there had been no admission of guilt or clear proof of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.087" offset="5016346">In other words, the scope of the area within which the privilege can be claimed is not necessarily coextensive with the scope of the area in which waiver occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.996" offset="5079980">In short, you have to go a little further before you find waiver than you need go in order to sustain a claim of a privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.798" offset="5139122">Now, let me consider another point that the Government raises in its brief and that is that in any event, the rule in Arndstein should be limited to cases where the witnesses is -- where the witness is an involuntary witness on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.688" offset="5218743">The Government does not deny that the Arndstein rule is the rule to be applied in civil proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.110" offset="5244343">As a matter of fact, in my main brief, as I point out at the bottom of page 13, the Government filed a brief in the Rogers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.473" offset="5277884">And in that brief, while they criticize the Court's ruling in Arndstein, they said this, "Where the witness is not the defendant in a criminal prosecution, there is a substantial body of authority that testimony as to a transaction waives the privilege with respect all other inquiries pertinent to that transaction,” which is what I call the open door rule in which is the rule that was applied in this case by the Court of Appeals, but the Government continues, “This Court however has indicated that the privilege is not waived merely by a testimony as to a transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.748" offset="5434932">And that before the witness can be held to have waived, there must be an element of incrimination in what he has disclosed."</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.099" offset="5472340">Now, there are additional reasons why you can't predicate a waiver in a civil case upon a mere taking of a stand.Let me mention one or two of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.205" offset="5508807">First of all, the right to claim the protection of the Fifth Amendment does not come into play until there is an element of compulsion to testify concerning an incriminating matter, not simply a compulsion to testify, but a compulsion to testify concerning an incriminating matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.527" offset="5602011">It might be said therefore that a witness who appears in court pursuant to a subpoena is compelled to appear and is compelled to testify but he is not compelled to testify as to an incriminating matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1420.857" offset="5683409">I suppose only a witness who is not a party would be appearing pursuant to a subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.584" offset="5706292">And so, what I'm talking about is an involuntary witness using the time to mean a witness who is appearing pursuant to a subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.767" offset="5738998">And the point that I'm making is that the subpoena itself does not supply the element of compulsion because the subpoena does not compel him to testify to incriminating matter, it compels him to come in and testify generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.975" offset="5795840">Now, it is not until he claims the protection of the Fifth Amendment and the Court then issues a directive to him to testify concerning this matter which he claims of incriminating that you get the element of compulsion so that the right to claim the privilege itself does not arise until after the witness is on the stand after he has been sworn and after he has been asked the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.271" offset="5901061">Obviously, up until that point, since there was no right to claim it, there could not be a waiver merely by taking the stand.</text>

            <text syncTime="1802.628" offset="7210423">Now, I want to touch briefly on some other facts with difficulties that we get into when they say that there is a waiver as soon as you take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.827" offset="7243233">It's generally recognized, I think, as mid law that the claim of the waiver has to be made under oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.399" offset="7269564">Prior to the time that the witness takes the stand, he's not under oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.415" offset="7281580">And therefore, he is in no position to claim the waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.281" offset="7293074">It's generally recognized also that the claim of the waiver must be made in a factual setting where the Court can clearly see that there is a possibility of incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.598" offset="7334348">And all too frequently, that factual setting will not appear until after the witness has taken the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.962" offset="7359843">If, therefore, we say that the waiver occurred when he took the stand, we are in effect compelling him to -- to prejudge what questions are going to be put to him and whether or not those questions will call for a possible incriminating answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.310" offset="7429224">Now, I want to leave the trial court and deal, if I may, with the holding of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.328" offset="7453257">The Court of Appeals, as I point out earlier, did not sustain the trial court in its contention that there was a waiver as soon as my client took the witness stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.766" offset="7490978">Instead, the Court of Appeals said, "On the basis of the general answers you gave on the questions were put to you by your counsel questions that were not limited to the pre-1946 period, we believe that you, in effect, opened the door."</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.960" offset="7563807">That's in essence what the Court is saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.284" offset="7573107">“You have indicated in absence of fear of incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.069" offset="7588258">You have demonstrated a willingness to testify in this particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.999" offset="7607902">And having done that, you have waived the protection of the Fifth Amendment and you must subject yourself to cross-examination the same as any other witness would do.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.806" offset="7651161">Now, the authority, which the Court of Appeals relied on to sustain in that respect, was Raffel against United States, a case which has come in recently, I think, for some criticism in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.929" offset="7707690">In the Grunewald case, it was considered and there were some members of the Court who thought that it should be overruled but I believe it was not overruled in that case but we have to regard it as still the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.112" offset="7756382">But it's still the law with respect to a defendant in a criminal case who voluntarily takes the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.718" offset="7786789">It cannot be the law with respect to a defendant in a civil case and takes the stand unless we are to completely ignore Arndstein.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.569" offset="7822211">My second point in connection with that is that it is almost impossible to conceive of a situation where a witness by denying guilt by saying, "I've done nothing that is incriminating," thereby, waives the privilege.In short, what I'm saying is that under no circumstances can a negative answer to the question that is supposed to be an incriminating question serve as the predicate for a waiver because by virtue of the question being negative, the witness has denied that there is any guilt whatever associated with him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2011.034" offset="8044042">The answer to that is that the Constitution has said the Government is not entitled in this limited area to cross-examine the witness unless the witness voluntarily agrees to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.710" offset="8090749">And this Court has interpreted that constitutional provision as saying not until the witness has admitted guilt or given clear proof of crime are we prepared to say she has voluntarily agreed to submit the cross-examination in that area.</text>

            <text syncTime="2266.068" offset="9064176">He is not compelled to give incriminating testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.686" offset="9074730">That's a point I was making a little earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.980" offset="9083820">The compulsion does not arise until he claims the privilege and the trial court overrules his claim and then directs him to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.581" offset="9118302">He is then being compelled to give evidence which, if it is incriminating, would violate his privilege under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.746" offset="9166890">Now, in the course of our argument here before, I believe it was Mr. Justice Frankfurter who called our attention to this Court's ruling in In re Hudgings with the suggestion that perhaps the element of obstruction is a necessary element to be assumed in all cases where it is sought to punish someone for criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.833" offset="9243272">I would like now to address myself to that proposition, and I began with a flat statement that I interpret In re Hudgings as applying to all criminal contempts in the federal court whether they are under Section 1, 2 or 3 of Section 401.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.516" offset="9317982">I am aware that this Court, during the course of a previous argument, implied if there was any decision indicating that the requirement of a showing of obstruction had been made with respect to a contempt predicate upon a violation of subsection (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.866" offset="9383393">I must confess that I know of no such case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.573" offset="9394260">But I do know of one case, and that's Clark against U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.872" offset="9407425">It's not cited in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.091" offset="9412336">That's reported at 289 U.S. at page 1 where the Court has found the element of obstruction necessary in order to uphold a charge of criminal contempt based upon a violation of the second section of Section 401.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.064" offset="9480255">That second subsection refers to misconduct on the part of any officer of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.221" offset="9504810">In the Clark case, there was involved a juror who had given false answers in the course of her voir dire and had actually concealed some of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.079" offset="9548278">And in the first holding in that case, the opinion was written by Mr. Justice Cardozo, we find these words, “Concealment or misstatement by a juror upon a voir dire examination is punishable as a contempt if its tendency and design are to obstruct the processes of justice."</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.394" offset="9633541">Now, in as much as the Court has found no statutory difficulty in concluding that the requirement in In re Hudgings concerning obstruction applies to subsection (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.515" offset="9678054">I don't anticipate that there would be any difficulty in finding that also applied to subsection (3), but I don't predicate my argument upon that alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.422" offset="9713685">A rereading of Ex Parte Hudgings, I think, makes the point additionally clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.376" offset="9737404">For there, the Court said, "An obstruction,” and I'm reading now from page 2 of my supplemental memorandum, "An obstruction to the performance of judicial duty resulting from an act done in the presence of the court is then the characteristic upon which the power to punish for contempt must rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.383" offset="9825489">This being true, it follows that the presence of that element must clearly be shown in every case where the power to punish for contempt is exerted.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.639" offset="9878465">My interpretation of In re Hudgings then is that it admits that no exception insofar as contempts in the federal court is concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.045" offset="9912111">Counsel, in his reply brief, dwells primarily upon the rule at common law and that at common law, any violation of a court's order amounted to a contempt without the necessity of a showing of obstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.987" offset="9975850">The first answer to that, of course, is that there is no so such thing as a common law contempt in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.877" offset="9999464">There's no such thing as inherent power of a lower Federal court to punish for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.031" offset="10020049">Its power must be gained from the three corners -- four corners rather of Section 401 and only then as interpreted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.848" offset="10059337">And in Hudgings, this Court has said and this Court repeated in In re Michael and also in Offutt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.323" offset="10089221">This Court calls attention to the pervading effect of this requirement of obstruction as applied wherever it is sought to punish someone for a federal -- for a criminal contempt in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.146" offset="10148571">Example in Offutt, this Court said, "The pith of this rather extraordinary power to punish without the formalities required by the Bill of Rights for the prosecution of federal crimes generally, is that the necessities of the administration of justice require such summary dealing with obstructions to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.912" offset="10227566">It is a mode of vindicating the majesty of law, in its active manifestation, against obstruction and outrage."</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.642" offset="10266540">Now, it was suggested in the course of the trial of the earlier case that as a practical matter, every refusal to obey an order of a trial court really amounts to an obstruction and you will find the same thought expressed in In re Hudgings, and I believe the same thought is expressed in In re Michael.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.184" offset="10356715">But this Court made it abundantly clear that that falls under the heading of incidental obstruction and that the Court was not concern there with incidental obstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.342" offset="10393287">It meant something that disrupted the processes of the administration of justice and that something had to clearly appear from the record in the case and had to -- I would say had to clearly be found by the trial court in his certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.619" offset="10450442">Otherwise, he has not set forth the facts constituting the alleged contempt which is required whenever he seeks to punish someone summarily for a criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.597" offset="10498299">The certificate in this case, and there is no formal certificate where I have not raised the issue, I believe, the trial court intended that his opinion had served as his certificate because he specifically directed that it be tied up and handed up to him for signature, and I think that, perhaps, was a substantial compliance with the requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.294" offset="10581159">I believe, however, that if the Court is not prepared to say that the element of obstruction must be shown in every case of criminal contempt whether it'd be under subsections (1), (2) or (3), the minimum that this Court should say is that the element of obstruction must be clearly shown wherever it is sought to punish summarily an alleged criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.263" offset="10685022">And I say that because I think the rule itself makes it clear that the Congress there or perhaps, it was the Court is concerned with the -- with the matter of having a certificate filed by the trial judge that will serve as one and the same time as both the indictment charging this so-called crime as well as the judgment itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.388" offset="10785541">The requirements of due process would require that in any such indictment, the accused, at least, is entitled to know that conduct on his part which is alleged to have constituted the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.296" offset="10833084">And if In re Hudgings is good law, and I submit that it is, one necessary element of that would be a finding of obstruction and there is no such finding in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.906" offset="10879582">Now, my final point has to do with the overall limitation on the power of the federal courts to punish for contempt and that limitation was first expressed, I believe, in Anderson versus Dunn where this Court used the term “the least power -- “the least possible power adequate to the end proposed”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.180" offset="10960666">The end proposed in all of these cases is, of course, the removal of the so-called obstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.848" offset="10983340">I contend, therefore, that in this case, the trial court did not used “the least possible power adequate to the end proposed”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.320" offset="11017195">If he had, he would have merely stricken the testimony on direct examination without applying the drastic authority to punish summarily for criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.808" offset="11063171">I suggest further that the mere fact that the trial court is given, under the statute, this question to determine whether the alleged conduct will be considered as civil or criminal contempt does not necessarily make his determination of that issue controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.206" offset="11128790">And that in a given case where the obstruction could be removed by treating the conduct as civil contempt and therefore not punish merely as drastically as criminal contempt, there is an obligation on the part of the trial court to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3323.289" offset="13293087">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.267" offset="13317016">When this case was here last term, petitioner, as the Court will recall, devoted herself entirely to the argument that there had been no waiver of privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.322" offset="13373231">We denied that as we do now for we say basically that the notion that a party can volunteer direct testimony in her own cause consisting here of a series of general denials of broad exculpatory statements, the word “general denials” is the term of petitioner's counsel in its brief on re-argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.644" offset="13490573">The notion that a party can volunteer such general denials on direct testimony and then its her privilege, when cross-examined for purposes of testing the veracity of those exculpatory statements, is simply one that we think is wholly unacceptable and has no foundation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.588" offset="13582315">If I understand correctly, the argument of petitioner's counsel here today, namely, that a defendant in a case and takes the stand and then ward off cross-examination, so long as a defendant in his direct examination does not incriminate himself, then I suppose that the logic of that would apply equally to the criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.683" offset="13698717">It would follow, I suppose, if that were a sound argument that a defendant in a criminal case can take the stand and protest innocence and then meet every question on cross-examination with the statement that the answer might incriminate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.111" offset="13760366">I think I hardly need to cite the cases to demonstrate that that is not the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3452.642" offset="13810521">Since it was a civil case, I think she was subject to being called as a party witness under the civil rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.082" offset="13840300">She was so called -- she claimed privilege when she was called as a compelled witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.099" offset="13872379">And in every instance that the claim was made, it was sustained by the District Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.799" offset="13903099">She got into this difficulty, the citation for contempt came about only as the result of the fact that she reappeared on the stand a second time volunteering as a witness in her own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.090" offset="13972271">On that second appearance as a witness in her own behalf, she testified without limitation as of the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3532.545" offset="14130155">I think petitioner is simply confusing the case of a compelled witness with the case of a volunteer witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.993" offset="14159935">Arndstein was called before a commissioner in bankruptcy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3546.731" offset="14186893">And he was called before the Commissioner as a compelled witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.194" offset="14208731">The Commissioner asked for a certain date or an information and Arndstein produced a limited amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.857" offset="14235376">Actually, I think it was a statement of some -- a statement of assets and liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.372" offset="14261394">He was then asked to give further information and to produce more and claim privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.583" offset="14290233">But this Court, ultimately, held that the partial disclosures made by giving this limited amount of information did not constitute a waiver of privilege on the part of a compelled witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.866" offset="14343419">It said that a compelled witness, an involuntary witness does not waive privilege, of course, until the point is reached where he makes a disclosure which gives proof of crime or implication in a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.081" offset="14436310">Of course, in the case of a compelled witness, he can't claim privilege until something incriminating is asked to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="4323.299" offset="17293166">Now, there can be, I submit, no such privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="4329.004" offset="17315944">The privilege is a privilege to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.868" offset="17327438">It is not, we submit, a privilege to tell a one-sided version of particular events.</text>
            <text syncTime="4341.406" offset="17365577">Now, I would like to take just a moment while still on the subject of waiver and privilege and before going on to the question of contempt and contempt sanctions to say that we do not read the District Court's opinion as stating merely that there was a waiver by taking stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="4367.041" offset="17468082">That opinion appears in the record at pages 38 to 40.</text>
            <text syncTime="4373.337" offset="17493264">And the Court begins its opinion on the contempt matter, and I'm looking at the first paragraph of the opinion on page 38.</text>
            <text syncTime="4382.870" offset="17531402">It begins by saying that she waived the right to claim any privileges under the Fifth Amendment by reason of having testified as a witness in her own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="4395.875" offset="17583438">I go on to page 39 in the bottom of that page and the Court points out, "The defendant was then examined by her own counsel at length with respect to the subject of this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4408.924" offset="17635683">And at the end of such direct examination, the District Attorney asked certain relevant and material questions with respect to these proceedings."</text>
            <text syncTime="4417.699" offset="17670792">So I say that there is emphasis at various points in the opinion on the fact that she testified fully and not merely on the fact that she took the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="4430.500" offset="17721992">It's perfectly true that on page 40, the Court goes on and says, "The Court is of the opinion that the defendant, in taking the stand as a witness in her own behalf, waived the right,” etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="4444.370" offset="17777476">Now, reading the several expressions together, I wouldn't say that this opinion constitutes a holding that merely taking the oath is a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="4455.022" offset="17820003">I think that we need rest on no more than the proposition that the Court of Appeals rested on which is that certainly, a witness can't testify voluntarily as a witness in her own behalf as to particular matters and then shut off cross-examination as to those things.</text>

            <text syncTime="4555.316" offset="18221244">Turning from the questions then which go to the nature of a privilege and what constitutes a waive or privilege to the questions which go to the issue was the contempt power properly invoked and is the sentence for contempt and authorized sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4586.526" offset="18346005">Now, of course, we are relying here, as the Court has heard, on the proposition that this was a contempt under the third subparagraph of Section 401.</text>
            <text syncTime="4602.032" offset="18408072">The Court -- the District Court that is made a point at each occasion when Mrs. Brown refused to answer the questions on cross-examination of directing her to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4622.474" offset="18489887">And his ultimate holding as to contempt rested upon her refusal to obey that direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4632.163" offset="18528549">I might say in passing that the District Judge heard legal argument as to the claim that there had been no waiver of privilege.</text>

            <text syncTime="5096.708" offset="20386795">Well, I think in a broad sense, certainly, every case of perjury is also an obstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.068" offset="20408216">I think Your Honor said that in Michael, as I recall rightly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5107.750" offset="20430994">Now, I think that the important difference between Hudgings and Michael and this case is that the Court felt that there would be serious consequences and for various reasons in permitting a case of perjury to be treated by the contempt process rather than by the criminal law process which was applicable to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5137.279" offset="20549068">The Court pointed to several factors as I recall in Hudgings and Michael.</text>
            <text syncTime="5144.704" offset="20578743">One of them was that if a judge could threaten a witness and perhaps, “threaten” is -- is an unfortunate word here, a judge could take a position which would seem to the witness, to threaten the witness with liability and contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5166.405" offset="20665574">If the witness failed to satisfy the judge's notions of what proof was, then there would be a great danger to the Court stated in Hudgings that the contempt power could be used to shape the testimony of -- of witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5183.307" offset="20733179">A judge might have a -- a strong opinion as to where the proof lays.</text>
            <text syncTime="5187.926" offset="20751673">And if he were permitted to say to a witness, “I think you're -- you're lying about this, and I may hold you in contempt unless you convince me that you're going to tell the truth,” there would be an instrument for serious perversion of justice this Court said in Hudgings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5208.157" offset="20832549">Of course, there are other good reasons for not treating perjury by other contempt process.</text>
            <text syncTime="5214.758" offset="20858984">Perjury is certainly a -- an offense which is peculiarly difficult to prove than has in its serious possibilities for miscarriage of justice in view of the fact that people's versions and memories as to events may differ so widely.</text>
            <text syncTime="5234.435" offset="20937665">It's for that reason that this Court has insisted on the application of the so-called two-witness rule in perjury cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5244.846" offset="20979357">Finally, I think, there is a considerable reluctance on the part of the Court to -- and has been, to permit or encourage use of the contempt process where the criminal law is clearly applicable and offers a wholly satisfactory remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="5413.980" offset="21655824">Now, I take it that both in Hudgings and Michael, it appears to me that the Court, itself, is clear on the proposition that where as perjury should be prosecuted under the perjury statute that a refusal to testify or a refusal to be sworn as a witness would be punishable as a contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5436.612" offset="21746416">There's been a great deal of discussion about Hudgings.</text>

            <text syncTime="5468.510" offset="21873998">And in the next sentence, “Despite some confusion caused by certain ambiguous forms of expression used by the court below in dealing with the subject, it is indisputable that the punishment for contempt was imposed solely because of the opinion of the Court that the witness was willfully refusing to testify truthfully, that is was committing perjury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5495.709" offset="21982772">Now, I take it that Hudgings means that a refusal to testify as a contempt but that the Court may not use the contempt power merely because it's convinced that a witness is testifying untruthfully and say, “Now, that's obstructing the judicial process.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5514.375" offset="22057482">I take Hudgings to mean that in the latter case, the Court must refer the matter to the United States Attorney and to judge an indictment for perjury?</text>

            <text syncTime="5714.061" offset="22856202">Let me read you of Judge Howe said in -- in citing William F. Hudgings for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5723.365" offset="22893401">He set forth the facts and he had been duly sworn, did vocally refuse to -- to answer certain questions truthfully and fully and likewise then and there, falsely square, whereas the said William F. Hudgings in so answers, in so answering and so refusing to answer was guilty of a contempt of this Court and of the authority of this Court by misbehavior in his presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5756.409" offset="23025580">Now, that recital therefore, etcetera, state exactly what I put namely that although it may be within the descriptive category of 3, it is not excluded from one as a misbehavior in the presence and therefore, the requirement of Hudgings is something more than the external objective context is required before you didn't find it as a contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5787.462" offset="23149819">And for that, I read what he said -- his wife said as to -- "An obstruction to the performance of judicial duty resulting from an act done in the presence of the Court."</text>
            <text syncTime="5797.837" offset="23191301">Certainly, that's said.</text>
            <text syncTime="5800.635" offset="23202482">But it is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="5802.386" offset="23209482">But the mistake if we think evident since it's either overlooks or misconceived, the essential characteristic of the obstructive tendency underlying the contempt power form the strictest attribute and necessary inherent obstructive effect you call swearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5823.043" offset="23292134">Now, what I put to you is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5825.695" offset="23302687">Why should there be such a requirement for an establishment of misbehavior of Hudgings by answering and refusing to answer for whatever reason and not be within Section 1 when the refusal to answer was ex-hypothesized an honest belief that the Fifth Amendment protects.</text>
            <text syncTime="5850.780" offset="23403102">And we've been discussing here and you've not dismissed this privilege the wave of the problem so that we have got the case before us in which a court may find that there was at least an honest legal question -- I don't mean an honest, not a frivolous legal question as to whether she, in her opinion, could refuse which doesn't mean an order can't be given but it doesn't follow that therefore she must go to jail.</text>

            <text syncTime="5911.454" offset="23645727">Page 7 of our supplementary brief, some 10 cases in which there was a claim of privilege in which the District Court ruled that the claim was ill taken in which, as a result, the person claiming the privilege was held in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5936.556" offset="23746142">Now, those cases run the -- the ones with selected, I think, but probably the most important cases on questions of waiver or privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="5946.119" offset="23784385">They run from Brown against Walker down to the recent Ullmann immunity statute case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5952.913" offset="23811553">Now, in every one of those cases, the way in which the validity of the claim of privilege was tested when it was overruled by the Court was by the person being held in contempt and taking an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5969.798" offset="23879158">I certainly don't think it will be said that in those 10 cases, most of which were decided by divided courts that the claim of privilege was wholly unsubstantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5980.921" offset="23923670">There were serious questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5982.078" offset="23928268">I think much more serious questions than are raised by the claim in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5987.992" offset="23951882">I say the historical way of raising the question of a claim of privilege once that it has been denied has been by appeal from a sentence for contempt.</text>
