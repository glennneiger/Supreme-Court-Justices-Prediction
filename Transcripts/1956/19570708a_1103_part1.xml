            <text syncTime="76.192" offset="408116">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.775" offset="426506">The issue in this case is whether the United States has the right to decline to prosecute a soldier and let him be prosecuted under Japanese law where there is concurring jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.788" offset="486484">And should the United States Court review that decision?</text>
            <text syncTime="102.372" offset="512815">The facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.874" offset="522846">January 30th of 1957, a military unit of the United States was maneuvering on Camp Weir in Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.607" offset="569762">This maneuver area was an area that was part at the time assigned to the United States to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.422" offset="605080">About 40% of the time was used by the Japanese defense troops.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.943" offset="631097">And the balance, a substantial portion at that time was used by Japanese civilians for farming and other purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.113" offset="671848">At this time, during the maneuvers, there were so many Japanese nationals in the area that the commander decided that it was unsafe to continue to use live ammunition in the maneuvers.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.295" offset="728586">And he directed that blank ammunition be used from that time on.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.077" offset="751679">During an interval in the maneuvers, the respondent and another soldier by the name of Nickel were directed to guard a machine gun and some field jackets on a hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.546" offset="813537">They proceeded to this ridge and then the respondent placed a blank cartridge in his grenade launcher and using a blank, he discharged it.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.109" offset="883858">He put two times toward Japanese nationals in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.855" offset="906742">The second shot out of the grenade launcher of this empty cartridge case struck a Japanese married woman in the back and caused her death.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.856" offset="966823">The commander of the unit of the respondent certified that this act, the killing, was an act in pursuit -- in the performance of the respondent's duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.557" offset="1033592">This was done on February 7th.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.573" offset="1045713">On February 9th, the Japanese protested the certificate and claimed that the machine gun was never at any time threatened by the Japanese that there was no effort to interfere or molest it.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.983" offset="1111333">And the action was not done in performance of official duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.649" offset="1129932">And it was not necessary to fire this empty cartridge out of the grenade launcher in the protection or a guard of the machine gun and these field jackets.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.410" offset="1184998">There was a procedure set up by the two Governments whereby a Joint Committee would inquire into the question if there was a dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.081" offset="1223659">And for the --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="280.141" offset="1223973">So, before you get to that, there is in the record, an affidavit of the chief counsel of the Department of Defense, which shows more precisely what the facts of the case are.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.473" offset="1285308">Would you mind stating the circumstances under which those came in the record?</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="299.524" offset="1301504">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.083" offset="1311744">That affidavit recites in detail the fact that there were certain witnesses who have stated, including the -- the soldier Nickel that they were directed and the soldiers proceeded to throw out these empty cartridges to invite or entice the Japanese civilians to come and try to get them and take them away to sell and recover what value they could out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.503" offset="1421354">And that there was actually a -- an invitation for them to come forward and pick them up prior to the time of the discharge of this empty cartridge out of the grenade launcher.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.820" offset="1470673">And that goes into considerable detail in reciting these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.442" offset="1489168">And it was presented to the lower court and was sealed at the request to the Government to protect the respondent from any adverse effect upon his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.921" offset="1531068">The Government has no other interest in having it sealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.933" offset="1543084">And it is in this Court for its consideration in a sealed form if the Court cares to go into that detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.064" offset="1571610">But there was a very real conflict as to even the two soldiers involved in regard to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.753" offset="1610376">And whether there was enticement and whether these Japanese civilians were invited in fact to come forward and then have this empty cartridge launched against them out of the grenade launcher.</text>

            <text syncTime="1067.558" offset="4373608">And if not, it was clear under the Treaty that Japan would have the primary jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.427" offset="4401089">And this was -- this was a case of concurrent jurisdiction because it was a violation of both the Japanese law and the Military Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.225" offset="4436302">And if -- if it was not in the performance of official duty, it was clearly something that Japan would have a right to prosecute under the Protocol under section 3 (b).</text>

            <text syncTime="1582.606" offset="6433834">Now, it seems to the Government that the -- the legal questions involved in the case are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.700" offset="6466121">The primary question is whether or not under international law there is any immunity from -- in the respondent from the laws of Japan for an offense committed in Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.307" offset="6540622">There's no question of what the offense was committed in Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.631" offset="6553893">And that the respondent has always been in Japan since the offense was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.155" offset="6576044">So, we have to turn to international law to determine whether or not there is any immunity from the laws of Japan for the respondent or any soldier located in that country without a Protocol or treaties or agreements of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.715" offset="6662248">And we believe that in the first place, it's the position of the United States Government, both the Executive and the Legislative branches that there is no immunity under international law for even a friendly force in a -- a foreign country such as Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.902" offset="6746990">And that goes back to the Schooner Exchange Case that that this Court has dealt with not directly but by reference from the Covert and (Inaudible) cases in which the Court referred to the fact that there would -- would not be immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.394" offset="6812923">And it was recognized in the Schooner Exchange case by this Court that any interference or any claim of immunity whatsoever in the country, with a friendly force would be a reduction in the sovereignty of that country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.552" offset="6877602">And it would be taken onto the other country that claimed it, a portion of that sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.371" offset="6900903">And, of course, in that case, the Chief Justice Marshall recognized that even if there was an implied immunity which he recognized as to the Schooner Exchange itself that that could be modified at any time by the sovereign of the country where the friendly force was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.322" offset="6976658">The host country by any agreement or by proceeding to by force or by submitting the particular force to his courts and thereby, remove any implied immunity that there might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.171" offset="7056071">Now, that the Government has not been able to find any country, any sovereign country in the world that recognizes the right of an immunity under international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.073" offset="7111659">So that it is -- has been the position of the United States both in the Legislative and the Executive branches in the consideration of the NATO Status of Forces Treaty that there is no immunity of -- under international law on the laws of the host country as to a friendly force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.155" offset="7199953">Now, there -- there is a conflict between some of the writers in regard to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.861" offset="7222836">But they cite no authority of any practice where any country has been willing to recognize such a limitation upon their sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.142" offset="7267976">And I think the outstanding examples in regard to the position of the United States are, that back in 1942, we considered this question in the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.000" offset="7323355">And the application concerning the military courts of various countries at that time and also the fact that Britain, as a part of the war effort had granted a complete immunity to United States forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.883" offset="7414888">And the British at the time, they adopted such a position stated that it was a very great departure from their practice and traditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.936" offset="7451146">It was only done because of the exigencies of the war and the position they were in at the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="4278.437" offset="17217076">And there's a -- a number of cases in which the Court -- this Court has taken the position that it will not review that action if it finds that there is a discretion in the Executive to exercise, that it will not proceed to review it and determine whether it should have been decided one way or another because it has not considered the Court competent to pass upon those various questions of foreign relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.502" offset="17337344">The Executive had to review this particular situation, the problems as to this respondent, the fact that Japan had waived in some 97.5% of all of these cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="4398.839" offset="17698774">It is with deep respect and humility that I speak for the men and women in the armed services of the United States overseas and for those of us at home who live at this sellout program whereby the constitutional rights of American soldiers overseas are stripped from them is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="4432.444" offset="17833148">It is these men on whom this nation relies for its security, for its honor and for the respective place, which this nation has in the family of nations.</text>

            <text syncTime="4478.273" offset="18016423">This Court recognized the importance of the question by calling this special session.</text>
            <text syncTime="4487.538" offset="18053517">Upon the right, record of this case, there is no issue of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4495.556" offset="18085595">They were stipulated in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="4498.765" offset="18098448">They are very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="4505.415" offset="18124988">An 18-year old boy born not far at all from the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln, volunteered to serve in the armed forces of this nation, wherever deemed necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4525.844" offset="18206699">Although, he was uneducated, the spirit of freedom and the realization of the dangers confronted this (Inaudible) without caused him to don the uniform of the American soldier of which he is justly proud.</text>
            <text syncTime="4541.340" offset="18268766">He is not militaristic.</text>
            <text syncTime="4544.230" offset="18280260">He did what many of the youth of this nation have done before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4549.618" offset="18301889">He desired to do his best, return to his home in hopes that upon return, it may be more secure and that he may live a more abundant life.</text>
            <text syncTime="4562.144" offset="18351940">At the end of his three-year term, conditions being what they are, he volunteered for an additional term.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.471" offset="18413275">And the duty which was assigned him was not the easy task.</text>
            <text syncTime="4583.493" offset="18437308">He was the foot soldier carrying the gun and the other instruments of destruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.433" offset="18469073">During his second term of enlistment and on January 30th, 1957, after a morning of target practice and sweat, he was ordered to guard American property on an American firing range known as Camp Weir.</text>
            <text syncTime="4610.109" offset="18543783">Trespassers came on to serve their own purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4616.584" offset="18569697">He fired an empty shell to scare them off, not to kill.</text>
            <text syncTime="4621.197" offset="18588191">And unfortunately, that act resulted in the death of a Japanese national.</text>
            <text syncTime="4629.183" offset="18620061">Our Government, being fully competent and equipped to judge on our standards, and I stress on our standards, thus it's a very material issue in this case, whether he acted rightfully or wrongfully, then decided to let the Japanese Court pass judgment on this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4654.636" offset="18721938">Admittedly, none of the constitutional safeguards which he would have or which he has as American citizen though worthy to be tried before an American Court would be carried forward with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4667.945" offset="18775124">I note that -- that the Solicitor General has been eloquently silent on the subject of the type of trial he would receive and what would happen to this boy before the Japanese Court, who according to the press, have been clamoring to have him brought before them for justice as they understand it and in accordance with their system and under their code which an American lawyer practicing in Germany has declared is an absolute joke and one of the most antiquated systems of -- of justice that exist in any nation of this world, including some of the Arab countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4705.716" offset="18926216">Now, how did this all come about?</text>
            <text syncTime="4708.253" offset="18936351">And by what method did the United States, acting through the Executive, turn this boy or agree to turn this boy over to the Japanese Government to stand trial on their system of law?</text>
            <text syncTime="4729.059" offset="19019630">And what is the historical background?</text>
            <text syncTime="4736.516" offset="19049409">It started in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4744.545" offset="19081592">Before the termination of World War I, the United States exercised exclusive jurisdiction over its troops in every country of the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="4755.737" offset="19126314">Despite the statements by the Solicitor of the contrary, the fact remains that the United States exercised exclusive jurisdiction over its troops wherever they were stationed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4767.835" offset="19174693">That is the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4769.559" offset="19181589">That has been the international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4771.889" offset="19190888">It has been recognized from time immemorial.</text>
