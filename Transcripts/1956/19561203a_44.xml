            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="18.690" offset="178134">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.197" offset="220139">This is a direct appeal from the dismissal of an indictment under the Corrupt Practices Act as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.691" offset="262144">The question presented is whether an offense is stated under Section 610 of Title 18, the criminal code, by an indictment charging that on a certain date, defendant, labor union made an expenditure of specified sums from its general treasury fund to pay the expenses of a particular political television broadcast over a commercial television station where the broadcast was intended to influence the electorate generally, to support the election of certain candidates for federal officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.010" offset="459421">Motion was made to dismiss the indictment on the ground that it was unconstitutional to apply it to the expenditures described in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.574" offset="501635">It was too vague and number of other constitutional reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.940" offset="523160">The indictment alleged in rather general terms in accordance with modern criminal practice the nature of the offense in four accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.318" offset="572688">It lead to the payment of specified sums of money ranging from $700 to $2500 to a named company to defray the expenses of political television broadcast urging and endorsing the selection of particular candidates or a name, commercial television station in which the appellees had no interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.315" offset="672684">It was alleged that the telecast included expressions of political advocacy and intended by appellee to influence the electorate, generally, including voters who were not members of the appellee union and to affect the results of the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.390" offset="744887">It was further alleged that the money expended was taken out of the general fund of the appellee and not from any other source.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.998" offset="779368">That the general fund consisted of union dues paid by members of local unions belong to and affiliated with the appellee and that expenditure was not made from voluntary political contributions or from subscriptions by appellees members.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.465" offset="849272">We call particular attention to the fact that in the C.I.O. case decided by this Court, the indictment was specific, as this court said, in regard to the details of the expenditures, how they were made, what they were made for.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.763" offset="922415">In this case, the indictment was not so specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.639" offset="941955">No bills of -- a motion for bills, in particular, were filed so that the issue now before the Court is whether the indictment is sufficient on its phase to state a cause of action under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.410" offset="1000991">We have a controversy between counsel as evidenced in the brief -- briefs as to whether the Court reinterpret or construe the indictment so as to limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.706" offset="1054177">The Government contends that there was no construction by the lower court to limit this indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.746" offset="1082389">Such action was not proper and the Court did not attempt to take any such action.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.735" offset="1110288">The Government did not acquiesce in any such construction but contended throughout with this indictment was broad enough to cover active electioneering.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.076" offset="1159711">And it's our position before the Court that the construction that this indictment does not state a cause of action, under this statute is so broad that even a -- a -- an action which would involve a statement on the telecast day after day, vote for X, the union's friend, would not be a violation under the construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.397" offset="1280920">In order to support the point that the Court did not undertake to reconstrue or limit this indictment in any way, we call particular attention to several different items.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.280" offset="1344449">First, on page 21 of the printed record, the last paragraph, the Court relates, if ideas of what the indictment charges.Right now, as I take the position of the defendant and if I am not correct right correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.890" offset="1418951">In the first place, even admitting that Congress had the right to include the word, "expenditures."</text>
            <text syncTime="335.220" offset="1444237">First, petitioner, defendant's position is that those are not the expenditures, items like this, as alleged in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.433" offset="1485093">Those are not the type of expenditures that Congress had in mind and that this Court in trying to give a constitutional -- in trying to interpret the law constitutionally, couldn't make any other decision except that they are not that kind of expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.513" offset="1553429">Then your second point is that if they are included within the expenditures, then the Act is unconstitutional for a lot of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.478" offset="1593240">Those questions were addressed to counsel for the appellee and the answer is - "That would be."</text>
            <text syncTime="378.774" offset="1618422">The Court interposing, "Is that right"?</text>
            <text syncTime="381.896" offset="1630960">The answer is, "That is a very accurate summary of our basic position, Your Honor."</text>
            <text syncTime="388.299" offset="1656560">Next as is contended that in our briefs, we did not urge this point about active electioneering as we do before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.092" offset="1695744">And I call your -- the Court's particular attention to two portions of our briefs which we have filed with the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.251" offset="1732420">One, and this is not in the briefs that we've -- our printed briefs before this Court page 53 of our principal brief before the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.533" offset="1777455">We discussed in the second, full paragraph in detail the position about active electioneering and say amongst other things in that paragraph, "and no corporation or labor organization spending money actively to electioneer for the success or defeat of a particular candidate can -- can have any doubt that its activity in such respect contravenes the express prohibition of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3719.136" offset="14979950">And now, the Government is trying to make it appear as though we were making a contribution direct or indirect to the campaign of the particular candidate and the relevant distinction between what the District Court said below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.654" offset="15049958">And what the Government is urging here is between a union stating its position for everyone to hear, and we're proud of our position, and a union simply doing what the candidate wants, namely, sloganeering for him, repeating his statements, being an arm of his campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.991" offset="15147342">But what the District Court did limit here, what the District Court did say is that this indictment charges only that the union, clearly electioneering, clearly stating its views, clearly political advocacy, but clearly stating its own views.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.772" offset="15222471">And that's what it meant, sir, on page 43 when it used the words “on behalf.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.113" offset="15243786">The Government tries to read this paragraph as though it didn't operate as an interpretation but it was the very interpretation that we were making of the indictment and that the Government was not objecting to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.263" offset="15300420">It was -- the union was not making an expenditure on behalf of a political candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.570" offset="15325602">It was not saying a slogan for the candidate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3868.005" offset="15575437">The argument between the Government and the union over the construction of the indictment is, that the Government contends that the indictment would permit proof that all we were doing was parroting a slogan for the candidate or that it would permit proof we were trying to make a contribution to the candidate through our activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.536" offset="15673553">We say the indictment as construed by the District Judge permits only a proof that we were engaged in political advocacy of the type involved in the C.I.O. case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.447" offset="15725171">In other words, the Government tried to distinguish the C.I.O. case in the lower court on the ground that it was a difference between a house organ and a commercial telecast.</text>

            <text syncTime="3949.193" offset="15900191">But we both agree, and that was I wanted to conclude on in this -- this afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3954.834" offset="15922657">We both agree that this Court can decide the question of whether the indictment, so interpreted, falls within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.334" offset="15956720">We do not take the position that this Court is faced with a constitutional issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3972.262" offset="15992456">To exclude a union taking its own position is certainly the proper interpretation of this statute and it leaves plenty left for the statute to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.070" offset="16031640">The statute still would apply to efforts by a union to become a part of the campaign of a particular candidate and would leave many efforts of speech that might be taken apart from this particular one, we say, and has the right to do and all apart from speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.731" offset="16098304">There are many expenditures that would be barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="4001.570" offset="16109693">The interpretation that Judge Picard gave does not, on his statement, that it's our position we may give, our advocacy we may give, does not limit the statute in such a way as to a emasculate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4014.615" offset="16161834">And it is on this phases, on the fact that the statute -- that the indictment charges a union out of union dues was stating its own position is -- it -- it would raise for this Court a constitutional issue of the gravest part.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.950" offset="16223169">It would mean that this Court was saying were it to uphold this action, it would mean in affect of saying that where a union, where real political advocacy may actually have influence that is not protected by the Constitution even though extremest views which may never have influenced will be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.011" offset="16307388">We ask for the right here.</text>
