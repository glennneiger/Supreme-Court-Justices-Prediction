            <label>Mr. Charles A. Horsky</label>
            <text syncTime="13.984" offset="159326">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.521" offset="173432">This is a proceeding hereon writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit by which the petitioner seeks a declaratory judgment that he is a citizen of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.313" offset="228603">The District Court denied him that relief and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.798" offset="254516">Both courts relied upon two provisions of the Nationality Act of 1940 as amended to hold that although he had once been a citizen, he was such no longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.808" offset="306552">The two statutory provisions which are involved are each subdivisions of Section 401 of the Nationality Act of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.135" offset="347930">The first relevant one, subsection (e), decrees that any American citizen, whether native-born or naturalized, who votes in any foreign political election or plebiscite shall lose his American citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.470" offset="413236">The second, which is subsection (j), decrees similar consequences for any citizen native-born or naturalized who remains outside of the United States with the intention of avoiding military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.994" offset="479378">The petitioner was found to have done both of these proscribed acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.135" offset="499963">That finding was not challenged in the court below and it is not challenged in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.443" offset="525145">The only issue is whether those two subsections are within the constitutional power of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.508" offset="553357">Now, briefly, the facts -- the remaining facts which will focus that constitutional issue are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.852" offset="582823">The petitioner was born in El Paso, Texas in 1909.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.336" offset="604766">He lived there until he was nine or ten years old when he went with his parents, who were themselves Mexican born, back to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.255" offset="652413">He lived there raising a family, marrying a Mexican national in 1932 until July 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.384" offset="696926">In that month, and again a little later in 1944, he twice returned to the United States to work as a railway laborer.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.521" offset="753455">In each instance, claiming falsely, that he was a native-born citizen of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.515" offset="789400">He had known that he was a native -- that he was born in the United States earlier than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.379" offset="816880">In July 1947, he attempted to return to the United States as an American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.089" offset="843734">The immigration authorities, citing against him the same two acts which are were relied upon by the lower courts here, held that he had lost his citizenship and excluded him.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.752" offset="894412">In 1952, he again returned to the United States, again claiming falsely, to have been a native-born Mexican.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.517" offset="941432">Shortly after he got into the United States, he surrendered himself to the immigration authorities, who after a hearing, ordered him deported to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.231" offset="980302">It is to review that administrative order that these present judicial proceedings were commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.578" offset="1017710">The case, I think, thus presents, squarely, the issue of constitutional power of Congress in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.398" offset="1052923">Stated specifically, the issue is this, may Congress declare that a native-born American citizen shall forfeit that citizenship and be deported from the United States if he votes in a foreign political election or if he avoid -- if he remains out of the United States to avoid military service?</text>
            <text syncTime="260.116" offset="1143829">Let me point out that the statutory provisions do not make those acts merely presumptive of an intention to abandon citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.190" offset="1180087">They are, in all circumstances and in all cases, complete acts of expatriation unless they are done under duress.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.525" offset="1221465">The statute also, I should point out, does not purport to make these acts for this -- this forfeiture a criminal penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.110" offset="1255842">Administrative determinations followed by the type of civil review which has -- had here is the only procedure which is provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.175" offset="1292100">Finally, it perhaps is worth pointing out that this statute does not require that the citizen, the ex-citizen, if that be the decision, know the consequences of the act that he does.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.140" offset="1343927">There is no finding here that petitioner knew or had reason to know that by the acts he did, he was forfeiting his American citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.807" offset="1382588">We believe that each of these subsections exceeds the power which is vested in Congress by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.094" offset="1415711">In a word, we believe that citizenship, native-born citizenship, of -- of a citizenship acquired by birth in the United States is a constitutional right which, except possibly as a criminal punishment which is not involved here, cannot be made to forfeit for the doing of acts such as these.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.026" offset="1511528">What Congress can do under the Constitution is to provide that a citizen, a native-born citizen, cannot undertake voluntarily to divide his allegiance with another sovereign state.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.915" offset="1579029">We concede that that is well within the -- the constitutional power of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.390" offset="1596897">Hence, it may provide as it has done in subsections (a) and subsections (b) of Section 401, that an American citizen, native-born or naturalized, who takes -- who acquires nationality in another sovereign state or who takes an oath of allegiance to another sovereign state forfeits his own American citizenship whether he wants to or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.145" offset="1703999">Those are the most ancient and the most conclusive expressions of intention to abandon citizenship as this Court has noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.935" offset="1743078">And in order to avoid or minimize the international complications that might well come from divided allegiance or divided responsibility, we agree that Congress may declare that a man cannot in -- in effect have two masters and that if he elects a new one, he is deemed conclusively to have agreed to abandon the old.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.066" offset="1843597">I say he may, because Congress can undoubtedly decree the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.218" offset="1860211">It need not require that it may.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.556" offset="1873586">Now, let me try, in the time I have, to answer two questions which I think are the basic.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.188" offset="1904097">First, on what basis can it be said, do I say, that that is the limit of congressional power in this area?</text>
            <text syncTime="458.917" offset="1938996">And second, if that be the limit of congressional power, can these two subsections which are involved be sustained?</text>
            <text syncTime="469.363" offset="1980792">The answer to the first question which is the limits of the power of Congress, I think is found both in our constitutional history and in the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.955" offset="2027186">As to history, the most significant fact is that this power was not exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.225" offset="2060309">This power was not claimed by Congress for over 150 years after the Constitution was adopted, until 1940 to be precise.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.686" offset="2110151">That is not to say, that matters of citizenship and of nationality were ignored by Congress during that 150 years, indeed not.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.363" offset="2144841">We fought the war of 1812 in a large part to assert our position that citizenship in other countries could be renounced by an American who wished to be nationalized here.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.844" offset="2202728">After a long debate through many Congresses, we declared in 1868 a right of expatriation, an American citizen who wished to give up us his American citizenship was conceded the right to do it by Act of Congress in that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.396" offset="2268975">We passed the Fourteenth Amendment which dealt with citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.603" offset="2289768">But it was not until 1940 that Congress for the first time asserted the power to deprive a citizen, a native-born citizen of his citizenship, of his constitutional right for the act -- for the doing of some act which did not involve new nationality or new allegiance.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.704" offset="2386213">Now, perhaps, it isn't quite accurate to say that there was never any assertion of that power because the decision -- the statutes involved in the Wong Kim Ark case in the 169 United States were not entirely dissimilar from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.794" offset="2458520">Your Honors will recall that in that case, Congress had decreed that a Chinese -- that Chinese children, children of persons ineligible to become citizens of the United States, that children should not themselves be citizens even though born in this United States and subject to its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.600" offset="2557785">This Court held that Congress had no power to take away the citizenship of those children by Act -- by Act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.858" offset="2594774">The Government urged in that case as it urges here that it must be of the essence of sovereignty that a State shall have the power to determine and to declare who are its citizens and who are not its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.410" offset="2657050">The Court did not deny that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.106" offset="2667813">The significant fact, however, which it pointed out was that the power had been exercised by the Constitution, that it was a constitutional right that Congress had determined by the original Constitution and in the Fourteenth Amendment that people born in this country and subject to its jurisdiction were citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.573" offset="2753703">The United States has decided, not by statute which Congress can change but by the Constitution which Congress cannot change, who are citizens of this country and who are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.037" offset="2803545">Now, the teaching of the Wong Kim Ark case is, as we see it, that we are dealing here with a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.284" offset="2840534">The Government, however, says, “We put that teaching to one side because the Court has taught us something else in Mackenzie against Hare in the 239 United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.583" offset="2889749">Indeed, the Mackenzie case, I think I can fairly say, is the keystone of the Government's argument in this case, and I think it therefore warrants our careful attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.318" offset="2932694">The facts, as you will recall, were very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.656" offset="2945964">Mrs. Mackenzie married a citizen of Great Britain in 1909.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.927" offset="2979088">She lived in California before her marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.882" offset="2990895">She was married in California and she continued to live in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.944" offset="3011166">When she tried to vote in California, she was told that she had -- her citizenship was lost by reason of her marriage to Mr. Mackenzie, a citizen of Great Britain.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.284" offset="3056515">And Congress had so declared in the 1907 Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.619" offset="3077831">It had declared that during the period of a woman's marriage to a foreigner, her citizenship was in effect suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.640" offset="3113984">That could be resumed on her -- on the dissolution of that marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.585" offset="3133733">But during the period of her marriage, she was not a citizen of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.482" offset="3157347">Mrs. Mackenzie claimed that the Act was either inapplicable or invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.630" offset="3181902">Parenthetically, I should add that that Act survived the Nineteenth Amendment by only two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.088" offset="3203741">It was repealed in 1922.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.882" offset="3218892">This Court held that the 1907 Act, however, did apply to Mrs. Mackenzie, notwithstanding, her continued residence in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.423" offset="3249089">And it held that it was valid and that she had in effect had her citizenship in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.212" offset="3276257">The Court relied first on the ancient principle of jurisprudence that merged the identity of husband and wife, and made the husband the dominant part of that merging.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.344" offset="3336756">That being true, the Court concluded, the marriage of an American woman to a foreign national may bring the Government of the United States into embarrassments and controversies with foreign nations due to this international marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.328" offset="3400704">And therefore, Congress could provide as it had that so long as the marriage status continued, Mrs. Mackenzie's American citizenship, even though even though native-born, was in effect suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.580" offset="3461726">The power of Congress which the Mackenzie case actually sustains, therefore, is the power which we do not dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.295" offset="3492551">The power of the Government -- of Congress to declare that one who voluntarily assumes a new nationality cannot at the same time retain the old nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.680" offset="3546049">But more important, I think even than that, Mr. Justice McKenna, who wrote the opinion in Mackenzie against Hare, seems to have been concerned, lest, the decision be given a broader sweep than he had intended and he made its -- its -- some of these limitations quite explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.782" offset="3618461">I'd like to quote just about four lines from the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.130" offset="3635911">He says, this is at page 311 of 239 United States, "There need be no dissent from the cases cited by the plaintiff," among which I should interpolate Wong Kim Ark was very prominent.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.204" offset="3704142">This one, "There need be no assertion of very extensive power over the right of citizenship or of the imperative imposition of conditions upon it."</text>
            <text syncTime="911.677" offset="3750118">Still more significant, "It may be conceded that a change of citizenship cannot be arbitrarily imposed, that is, imposed without the concurrence of the citizen."</text>
            <text syncTime="925.041" offset="3803512">The law in controversy," the Justice said, "does not have that feature.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.074" offset="3819708">It deals with a condition that's voluntarily entered into, with notice of the consequences."</text>
            <text syncTime="936.330" offset="3848652">I take it that those limitations in that opinion have, to some extent, made it difficult for the Government to find the proper way in which to attempt to justify these two subdivisions and the others like it of what, which you will hear in the later cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.342" offset="3912704">Its first theory, its first attempt at justification of these subsections was to argue that they were in effect presumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.405" offset="3957008">That Congress could in effect enact a conclusive presumption that the doing of an act, such as voting in a foreign election, was a voluntary renunciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.971" offset="3999222">And that consequently, it was done with the concurrence of the citizen because it was conclusively presumed to be with his concurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.196" offset="4032136">That theory, of course, would avoid Justice McKenna's statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.227" offset="4052302">It would avoid or perhaps better, evade the statement of Chief Justice Hughes in Perkins against Elg when he said that expatriation is the voluntary renunciation or abandonment of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.124" offset="4111862">The difficulty with the theory, however, is that Congress by that is in effect enacting a conclusive presumption of the waiver of a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.372" offset="4160867">And that seems quite clear beyond its power unless it is perfectly obvious that the fact presumed and the fact by which Congress enacts followed from one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.582" offset="4217710">Perhaps, it is for that reason but for whatever reason it may be, the Government does not any longer urge that theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.634" offset="4245922">It rather in this case, has approached it on the theory that Mr. Justice McKenna in effect is wrong and that Chief Justice Hughes in effect is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.298" offset="4288554">And that Congress does have the affirmative substantive power to take away citizenship when it chooses to do so, simply because it is vested with the attributes of sovereignty and that citizenship is in some manner related to the sovereign powers of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.827" offset="4370683">We don't deny that the United States has those sovereign powers, but we say it does not follow that Congress may exercise those powers in derogation of the constitutional rights of an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.461" offset="4429197">That, it seems to us, is established directly by the Wong Kim Ark decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.009" offset="4455424">We find full play for the principle that in the external affairs of the United States, Congress has the power to declare whatever is necessary to avoid embarrassments and controversies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.011" offset="4523447">If it has the power to determine as I said earlier, that a citizen who takes on a new nationality or a citizen who swears to a new allegiance cannot, even if he wishes to, retain his American nationality and allegiance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.584" offset="4605680">Well, let me pass because I think it will help to explain what I am saying better to my second question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.303" offset="4632534">If that is the scope of the congressional power, can these subsections be sustained?</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.211" offset="4656253">I say, I think it will help illuminate it because I will necessarily be talking about the power at the time that I talk about the subsections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.868" offset="4686869">Needless to say, we think it cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.230" offset="4696273">Indeed, we say that even on the Government's theory that support for these subsections is to be found in a -- in a sovereign power over international affairs, that they cannot be sustained.</text>

            <text syncTime="1948.801" offset="7898572">There are now on the docket of the Court, four cases involving issues of loss of nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.003" offset="7923336">Three of them are being argued today, tomorrow and one still pending on petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.469" offset="7949249">I think it may be helpful if I run through briefly the cases and the issues involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.848" offset="7974745">In the present case as Mr. Horsky has stated, the only issue is the validity of Section 401 (e), voting, and Section 401 (j), draft evasion, of the 1940 Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.267" offset="8028453">In the case which follows, the Nishikawa case, the issue of constitutional validity involves Section 401 (c) that is service by a dual national in the army of his other state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.581" offset="8077667">There is also in that case a statutory procedural issue of duress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.589" offset="8101700">In the third case, the Trop case, number 710, the issue is the constitutional validity of 401 (g) relating to desertion from the armed forces and conviction thereof during time of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.810" offset="8150601">There was also a subsidiary issue of what the meaning of desertion is as a statutory matter in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.935" offset="8175156">And not set for argument is the Mendoza-Martinez case, number 623, which also involves the validity of Section 401 (j), draft evasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.797" offset="8214549">There is no other issue in that case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.401" offset="8224998">So if you take these four cases together, the Court is faced with the issue of the validity of four subsections of Section 401 of the 1940 Nationality Act, service in a foreign army by dual national, voting, desertion and draft evasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.464" offset="8293230">I stressed the fact that as the 1940 Nationality Act in each one of these four cases and not the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act because the 1952 Act is in some respects different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.978" offset="8347251">And the cases you have before you, shall I say, bear on that Act in -- only insofar as the provisions were incorporated identically or without substantial changes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2159.745" offset="8742327">In the present case, here is a man who lived in Mexico from the time he was ten years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.129" offset="8763852">He, during the war in 1943 and 1944, came into this country as a Mexican, claiming Mexican nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.686" offset="8802095">He then returned to Mexico after the -- this provision relating to expatriation or loss of nationality for draft evasion was enacted in September 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.787" offset="8850474">After that time, he returned to Mexico and stayed in Mexico until 1947, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.343" offset="8876701">And it is admitted on this record that he stayed there for the purpose of draft evasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.895" offset="8898957">He also voted in the presidential election in Mexico in 1946 by his own admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.692" offset="8926124">One matter that I would like to stress because there is some reference into the brief -- in a brief to the fact that he may not be a Mexican is that he three times sought admission to this country as a Mexican national.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.539" offset="8969488">In fact, the reason why he is now being deported is he came illegally into the country claiming Mexican nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.706" offset="8994147">And then after some time reported himself to the immigration authorities and said, "I am not really a Mexican.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.415" offset="9013060">I'm an American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.834" offset="9018702">I want to adjust my status."</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.698" offset="9026121">And of course they began deportation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.308" offset="9036570">In the Mendoza-Martinez case, that petitioner resided in this country from 1922 at birth until 1940, who registered for the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.632" offset="9081919">In 1942, he went to Mexico and remained there until 1946 for the admitted purpose of evading the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.162" offset="9112012">He then returned to this country and in 1947, pleaded guilty to a -- accusation of draft evasion and was sentenced, and I believe served a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.002" offset="9151404">Then -- he then went back to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.969" offset="9163212">And in returning to this country in 1952, he then returned to -- he then returned to this country in 1953, I believe, and was then picked up for having entered the country illegally, being a Mexican national without the proper entry permits and papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.893" offset="9230921">Those are the facts in these two cases which involved Section 401 (j), draft evasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.111" offset="9259865">As to the general power of Congress over loss of nationality, I think it's important if I may to try to clarify an ambiguity in the word expatriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.625" offset="9309915">The word expatriation has two meanings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.541" offset="9321514">It has the meaning of a person who voluntarily renounces his American nationality and voluntarily acquires the nationality or allegiance of another country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.796" offset="9358608">And it is frequently used in that sense throughout our history and in some of the opinions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.495" offset="9381386">But it has a broader meaning than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.810" offset="9390582">It has the broader meaning of loss of nationality which can be imposed by Congress even though the individual does not wish to give up his American nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.476" offset="9433318">And it's in that broader meaning that it has been used by this Court too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.334" offset="9456724">In Mackenzie against Hare, Mr. Justice McKenna did not refer to Mrs. Mackenzie's loss of nationality as an expatriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.867" offset="9486817">He said it was tantamount to expatriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.909" offset="9499042">It was akin to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.562" offset="9505625">He was referring to loss of nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.288" offset="9516492">Now, the petitioners in these cases have raised different -- different arguments for saying that Congress has no constitutional power to pass these statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2463.374" offset="9956916">Mr. Horsky's position is somewhat narrower.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.774" offset="9966425">He concedes that the Government -- that Congress has power if the citizen acquires the nationality or allegiance of another government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.247" offset="10008325">I don't believe he went further than that in relation in -- with respect to international relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.794" offset="10030582">I think he limited it to the acquisition of another nationality or another allegiance regardless of the individual citizen's desire to give up his American citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.778" offset="10070497">The third position which is the one that the Government takes in these cases is that the power of Congress is a power inherent in its -- in -- in the sovereignty of the United States as a nation among the nations of the world, except to the extent that the power of Congress is limited by the specific provisions of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.505" offset="10153357">Congress has the same power to regulate nationality as all the other nations of the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.518" offset="10177494">The United Nations has collected laws concerning nationality then the volume which is published in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.544" offset="10209573">A quick survey of this volume will show that almost without exception, there may be a few, almost without exception, every nation in the world has provisions relating to nationality at birth, acquisition of citizenship and also loss of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.050" offset="10275610">And it is our position that Congress has this same power except to the extent that it may be limited by the provisions of the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2558.235" offset="10336319">Now, the broad power that we think Congress has and which I -- I may say was specifically confirmed in the Mackenzie and Hare opinion in a section which is quoted in our brief and which if I may, I'd like to read a few words to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.748" offset="10430360">Mr. Justice McKenna was dealing with the proposition that Congress had no power except to implement or confirm the consent of the individual citizen to lose her citizenship and he said this is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.236" offset="10480306">There are may be powers implied necessary and incidental to the express powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.824" offset="10498696">"As a Government, the United States is invested with all the attributes of sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.703" offset="10518235">As it has the character of sovereignty it has the powers of nationality, especially those which concern its relations and intercourse with other countries.</text>

            <text syncTime="2617.440" offset="10573093">And he then goes on to say that in the case before him, the Mackenzie case, he didn't think that -- that there was much problem because he thought there was a reasonable basis for the view of Congress that the -- having a wife of one citizenship and a husband of another might, and his word is might, he uses the word may, he doesn't even say would, might embarrass the United States in its foreign relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.141" offset="10675911">I started to say before that the Government's view of the source and extent of the power of Congress over nationality has a long history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.936" offset="10715094">It is confirmed by the statutes which Congress has enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.133" offset="10731917">We do not agree that Congress first attempted to exercise the power -- the power which is involved here in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.913" offset="10767026">We think it attempted to do that and it did do that in the statute of 1865 which provided that deserters from the Union Army and those who went outside their districts to avoid the then draft, lost the rights of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.449" offset="10829197">In 1907, it passed the statute which was involving Mackenzie against Hare.</text>

            <text syncTime="2794.089" offset="11279757">In the famous expatriation statute of 1868 to which Mr. Horsky referred, which confirmed the general right of citizens to leave this country and to expatriate themselves, Congress said in that same statute, "We have invested aliens who have come to this country with the rights of citizenship," meaning we have given them our nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.945" offset="11367111">In another statute, which was passed in the middle of the 19th century, Congress provided that children of American citizen -- citizens born abroad should be Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.908" offset="11410996">But it also went on to say, "But the rights of citizenship shall not descend to the children of fathers who have never resided in the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.560" offset="11445582">And in the Weedin case, in 274 United States, Chief Justice Taft held for a unanimous court that the word "rights of citizenship" related to nationality citizenship and did not descend to the children of American -- of fathers who had not resided in the United States prior to their birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.158" offset="11519979">The claim was that if he resided after they were born, it was enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.238" offset="11536280">And there are other statutes cited in our brief which refers to the term “rights of citizenship” as meaning nationality citizenship.</text>

            <text syncTime="2875.566" offset="11605661">In 1873, President Grant asked all the members of his cabinet to answer certain questions relating to the loss of nationality and expatriation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2908.340" offset="11736691">In 1873, about less than nine years after the 1865 statute was passed and the Secretary of State, Hamilton Fish, in answering the questions relating to expatriation, discussed them generally and then he said, "And it will be remembered that Congress has -- has asserted its right to denationalize its own citizens, and has defined one mode whereby the right of citizenship shall be forfeited, in the Act of March 3, 1865, which provides that."</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.308" offset="11864586">And he went on to paraphrase the statute relating to desertion from the army and draft evasion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3216.862" offset="12970820">And two, it did provide as Mr. Justice Douglas has pointed out that there must be a conviction or at least it was interpreted as providing that there must be a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.699" offset="13002167">In 1912, it was modified so as to apply only in peace time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.506" offset="13025364">I mean not to apply in peace time, but to apply only in time of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.101" offset="13039783">And the President was, at the same time, given, specifically given the power to pardon for previous peace time desertions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.389" offset="13072906">It existed during World War II as both Attorney General Biddle and Secretary of War Stimson stated in letters to the Congress in the -- in 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.774" offset="13114493">And in -- in fact in -- in 1924, President Coolidge saw fit to proclaim the -- a pardon for all those who deserted the armies in World War II after the armies -- before the formal peace there was a period between November 11th, 1918 and November -- September, I think 1921, when there was technical war but there was no fighting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.534" offset="13217520">And in 1924, President Coolidge pardoned these persons who -- not those who were guilty of draft evasion, those who were guilty of desertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.920" offset="13267048">Well anyway, when Congress came in 1940 to enact the 1940 Nationality Act for reasons which are unknown, it did not carry this over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.414" offset="13301008">It carried over the desertion provision of the 1865 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.743" offset="13318353">As I mentioned that statute related to two crimes, desertion and draft evasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.626" offset="13337893">Congress in 1940 carried over the desertion provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.037" offset="13351476">It did not carry over the draft evasion provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.402" offset="13364955">So that when it was -- the statute was enacted in 1940 it contained no provision for loss of nationality by reason of going abroad for draft evasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.766" offset="13398392">In 1944, Attorney General Biddle said a great problem had arisen in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.448" offset="13421171">There were several hundred people who were believed to have gone to Mexico.</text>

            <text syncTime="3348.973" offset="13499225">And Congress, specifically, did not wish to provide that there have to be a conviction, Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.027" offset="13527437">They -- they provided instead that there be judicial review to Section 503 of the Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.761" offset="13554395">That is court review, but there would not be a criminal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.247" offset="13568397">And the reason that they gave was that most of these people would stay abroad and there was of course a problem too of -- of statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.841" offset="13602774">The only tolling provision in the federal statutes of limitation is for someone who flees from justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.657" offset="13625971">And there is not -- it is not clear whether a person who stayed abroad for a long time would be fleeing from justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.069" offset="13651675">In any case, Congress did not wish to provide a -- a conviction at that time though it specifically made sure that there would be de novo judicial review by court proceedings.</text>
