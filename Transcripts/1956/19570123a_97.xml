            <text syncTime="10.117" offset="143862">Mr. Solicitor General.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="11.622" offset="149817">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.370" offset="196838">This is an action where the United States seeks an injunction against the Union Pacific Railroad Company for its taking gas and oil from under the right of way in a small area of an 80-acre section in the State of Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.268" offset="292446">The question that is presented is whether the grant by the United States to the respondent in the year 1862 under the terms of “the right of way through the public lands for the construction of said railroad and telegraph line” conveyed the title to oil and gas deposits underlying the right of way so that respondent may remove or dispose of such deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.293" offset="420551">The issue in the case entirely turns upon the construction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.060" offset="447613">The statute is set out on pages 2 and 3 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.066" offset="471646">I'd like to call to your attention briefly the terms which we think the controversy turns upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.141" offset="515950">You will note in Section 2 that -- that there is a grant of the right of way and a provision for materials for the railroad's construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.638" offset="565896">And, the right of way grant, like that in the Great Northern case, is of “the” right of way, not “a” right of way, and also includes the right to take from lands adjacent to the land of the road earth, stone, timber, and other materials for construction thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.689" offset="678118">The grant is to the extent of 200 feet on each side of the line of the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.443" offset="709151">And, Section 3 is the section in regard to what is generally called place lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.786" offset="738513">It involves the section that provides for the financing of the road, providing the lands by means of which it was thought the railroad would be induced and able to finance the construction necessary to complete it.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.383" offset="816880">And, in that section, there is a proviso, after providing the large number of acres that would be allowed to the railroad if it accomplished the construction provided, about halfway down on page 3, that all mineral lands shall be excepted from the operation of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.245" offset="908309">And, I dwell upon the word “Act” because the legislative history in regard to that is quite important in the eyes of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.631" offset="969853">There are several rules of construction that apply to the statute or in the grant in this case and are generally recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.504" offset="1005380">One of them is that any grant of this type by the sovereign must be strictly construed that it shall be liberally construed in regard to accomplishing the purpose by which the grant was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.331" offset="1064730">And, if all, you are trying to determine the rights that will pass under the grant, that it must be strictly determined in accordance with the explicit and clear terms of conveyance in the Act of grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.068" offset="1155636">Now, the legislative history of this particular proviso was that, in the House, they first had a provision for Act, that is, that the mineral lands that were not to be covered by the grant would be limited to the Act generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.186" offset="1252080">And then, it was amended in the House to apply only to that particular section which would have the effect of applying the reservation of the mineral lands under the grant of the Act only to the place lands in Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.813" offset="1330657">Then, when the bill got to dissent without any explanation, we were able to discover the Senate changed and put back in the word “Act,” so that the reservation of the grant of the entire Act should not apply -- should apply to the entire Act, all sections and not merely to the Section 3 in which the proviso was contained.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.962" offset="1463254">Now, there's a difference between the Government and the respond in regard to the purpose of that change.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.217" offset="1488227">It's contended by the respondent that the change was made so that subsequent sections of the same Act, which provided for other railroads to be or to have certain place lands and have certain financing assistance through such lands, would have the provisions of that section apply to it and that, therefore, the word “Act” was inserted for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.288" offset="1616541">But, the Act provided that these subsequent grants should, in all cases, be upon the same terms and conditions in all respects as provided in this Act for the construction of the railroad and telegraph line first mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.228" offset="1712253">The Government contends that you don't have to insert the word “Act” in the proviso at all to make that, the whole provision in regard to the prior sections of the right of way grant and the Section 3 place lands grant, apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.863" offset="1794800">That the only purpose that Congress could have had was to carry out its purpose of withholding mineral lands from the grant involved under this Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="446.642" offset="1889991">Then, in the Senate, it was changed to “Act” and the House agreed to “Act” change, so that the bill as finally passed was “Act.”</text>

            <text syncTime="472.506" offset="1993435">And then, the Senate changed it to “Act” and the House agreed to “Act,” so that there was complete agreement in the final terms that was passed in -- as “Act.”</text>

            <text syncTime="508.563" offset="2137631">There is, and in the history of Congress dealing with this subject, it did, in time, get around to the consideration of mineral rights as distinguished from mineral lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.416" offset="2193011">And, the court of appeals relied upon that as one of the principal grounds for its holding.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="533.890" offset="2238882">Yes, that's true, but we think that the -- the action of Congress in the history of the time was such that Congress want to make as clear as it possibly could still making it possible for the railroad to go through to withhold minerals and that was the fundamental purpose that Congress was trying to carry out by this action in the proviso and also the history of the period at the times.</text>

          <turn speaker="harold_burton" startTime="561.325" stopTime="564.077">
            <label>Justice Harold Burton</label>
            <text syncTime="561.325" offset="2348701">It said nothing in Act about mineral rights in that question.</text>

            <text syncTime="565.624" offset="2365837">It says mineral lands and not mineral rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.860" offset="2382764">Now, the history of the period indicates very clearly that the Congress was very much interested in mineral lands and minerals and the potential for the country in the development of minerals from the period of 1849, with the great discovery in California and the gold strike, and it was upper most in their mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.263" offset="2488404">Also, it must be kept in our minds that, at that time, in considering this history, gold was selling for $16 an ounce and that if Congress happened, by purposely or inadvertently, to include great gold strikes within this grant, that they might very probably be far more valuable than all of the lands that they were trying to provide to aid this construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.815" offset="2610657">But, throughout this period, from 1849 to 1862, the Congress was very careful in showing its intent that it should withhold the mineral lands from any grants to railroads or others.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.409" offset="2677008">This Court held, in view of that history, in a grant to the State of California and another grant to the State of Utah of school lands in certain alternate sections that even though those grants said nothing about the withholding of mineral lands with the proviso such as we have in this grant -- this Act of 1862, that it was the history and the intention of Congress during this period to protect these very valuable minerals and it was the purpose of Congress by that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.342" offset="2832697">And, although there was no such statement in two -- in both of those cases, that the grant to the State of California of the school lands did not include any mineral lands within its grant and the grant to the State of Utah did not include any such lands within its grant.</text>

            <text syncTime="881.455" offset="3629223">Now, the -- the Court has said, in several cases that we have to deal with, that there was a limited fee in connection with -- with grants under this very Act of the right of way.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.623" offset="3685857">And, we think that those cases do not need to be overruled, that if they are not extended to cover oil and gas which was not -- has never been considered by this Court before with regard to this particular Act and if they are limited to the facts of those cases and what the Court was trying to deal with in allowing the right of way to be used in a manner that would be properly contemplated for the railroad purposes, that the cases present no real problem to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.108" offset="3831829">But, to try to extend them to cover oil and gas which even at this late date, almost 94 years later, it's the first time that it's being asserted in the courts, that they have any such right and, certainly, is not necessary or closely related in any way to the railroad operation or what Congress had in mind at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.064" offset="3931617">Now, we concede, as argued in the -- by respondent in the brief, that the Government was eager to have the railroads constructed in the West during this period, and there's no question about that and the Government concedes.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.072" offset="3991698">But, the -- at the same time, the Congress was very explicit and careful not to make grants that would include the minerals and mineral rights in connection with these lands and to try to withhold, in every way that it could conceive at the time, the mineral lands from any exploitation or being given away in relation to these grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.341" offset="4096711">Now, it has been said in the Great Northern case by the Court that the United States did make lavish grants in connection with these railroad grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.053" offset="4139551">Particularly talking about that case, the Northern Pacific is probably the most extravagant or elaborates grants and the Union Pacific was also very substantial large grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.905" offset="4195035">But, if you take into account the fact that the Government was, in one section, placing a value of $1.25 per acre on the lands, if they were not sold within a certain time, that they would be open for sale at that price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.224" offset="4248221">You could see that the United States was trying to evaluate the grant that it was making in relation to the problem to be solved in providing for the construction of this railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.300" offset="4296600">Well, if you would try to apply that to oil and gas values, which were even then developed in 1862 in this country, and the State of Pennsylvania where we had 3 million barrels of oil being produced, and it's fair to assume Congress was aware of that situation, that the grant, in -- in -- if you would construe it to include minerals and gas and oil and other rights of that type, would certainly be almost beyond calculation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1160.988" offset="4747368">And, in view of these great gold strikes and the interest the whole country had, the Congress determined to look into the entire matter and see what should be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.572" offset="4797628">And, it wasn't until 1866 that they developed a considerable program for the acquisition of mineral lands and how it could be done, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.454" offset="4841200">That is referred to by respondents in their brief and they talk about the fact that this was one way to get the mineral lands or the minerals, under the right of way, developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.886" offset="4894908">The argument seems rather shallow to us in view of the fact that it's almost 100 years after the grant and they're just starting to try to develop them as far as oil and gas is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.041" offset="4943496">But, furthermore, when Congress did see fit to provide for the -- a manner in which you could acquire or obtain title to mineral lands, they were very careful to put certain limitations on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.699" offset="5002219">One of which was that you had to make some development of at least $100 a year, a total of $500, in order to be able to get title to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.339" offset="5044746">And, another was that you were limited to the extent of the vane that you would be able to get the title to the land above and -- and be able to explore as a mineral right, and that even a group or association could only follow a vane or a load for a certain distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.214" offset="5132204">So, there was a deliberate attempt on the part of Congress, when it did address itself to this particular problem, to try to avoid the monopoly and to also encourage and require a considered and careful policy of developing the minerals rather than being able to transfer them to somebody like this concept would be where they could hold them for 100 years or 1000 years and just have them in the ground without having the benefit of their development for any interest of he country.</text>

            <text syncTime="1499.621" offset="6101870">They would get the ultimate sections within a certain area but that area had to be within a certain distance of the right of way or the line of the railroad, and the railroad had not -- the line of the railroad had not yet been fixed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1773.934" offset="7199117">The canyon, defiled, or passed provision was inserted, according to the history, because railroads would get established and have their line determined through a pass in that -- the area in the Great Northern, and then, they would not go ahead with the construction but they would, be able to -- because they had the only practicable way through the mountains at that point, be able to sell that line to a great advantage, and all have a monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.942" offset="7351150">And, the Congress was trying to meet that problem that had developed in its experience in making that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.399" offset="7376959">And, of course, it had not occurred in the Union Pacific because, at that time, they were only considering three different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.552" offset="7405589">One was the Southern line, and one was the central, and one was the Northern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.453" offset="7425233">And, it was in its later period of the history that they try to provide for additional railroads in the Northern area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.412" offset="7460968">Then, on the latter provision, the -- that was inserted because the country had developed to such an extent between 1862 and 1875 where the settlers which were more -- quite limited in earlier period, were going out into this country and were very unhappy and complaining to Congress because the railroad was so slow in taking up its particular grants and place lands and establishing its line, and that the -- a right to settle was held up until that was completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.680" offset="7626062">So, by this device of providing that all conveyances would be subject to this as soon as the line was established and would be recorded on the local land offices, they were trying to take care of those complaints of the settlers and be able to go ahead with the transfers and conveyances to settlers instead of having -- having to hold the matter in abeyance for such a long period of time and having them unhappy about not being able to enter and develop them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.573" offset="7789693">The Court also relied in the Great Northern case upon the principle that these grants should be strictly construed in favor of the Government, that they should be construed as -- with regard to their purpose liberally so as to carry that out, that the Court could find no reason for any purpose in the grant of the railroad right of way and the grant that was made by Congress to believe that oil and gas was contemplated or intended in any regard in connection with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.034" offset="7939532">There was nothing to indicate it in the history and the history of the times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.575" offset="7957713">The Court said that the legislative policy changed, and that was a very important consideration of the Court in the Great Northern case in regard to the 1875 grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.045" offset="8011525">And, the Government concedes that the policy changed, but the policy changed from time to time as we moved through this era from the discovery of gold in the 1849 on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.052" offset="8055620">And, it first -- the grant to the Illinois Central was one of the cases relied upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.641" offset="8073906">It wasn't decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.857" offset="8078817">It was decided by the Illinois Court and Court of Appeals, and this Court did not examine the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.865" offset="8114866">It was a grant of 1850 in which where the grant was made to the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.544" offset="8137540">And, there was no provision and no -- of any kind in regard to withholding mineral lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.259" offset="8164394">Then, when the grant was made by the State of Illinois to the railroad, they made the grant of the right of way and the lands in fee, simple, and so recited in so many words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.275" offset="8216430">And, the Court relied a great deal upon that terminology that, in 1862, the history shows that Congress had progressed to the place where it wanted to make very certain that these mineral lands would be withheld, and it so did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.495" offset="8293334">Then, we get down to 1875 with the Great Northern grant, and they didn't give them any place lands of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.668" offset="8326040">They just gave them the right of way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.311" offset="8336593">And, later on, we get on to the 1909 period in which Congress tried to separate the surface from the minerals, dealing with the mineral rights question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.985" offset="8391346">But, it's contended by the respondent that that showed that Congress knew the difference between mineral rights and mineral lands and was doing that for the deliberate purpose of treating them as a reservation of mineral rights and preserving the minerals in that manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.676" offset="8466056">The Government contends that that wasn't the purpose of it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.349" offset="8480789">We recognize there is a difference, but Congress was trying to protect mineral lands, any lands that had minerals on them, from prior to 1862 right on through.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.672" offset="8542020">And, in 1909, it was trying to deal with the problem of the surface use of those lands, and the history shows it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.976" offset="8575248">And, at that time, when it tried to separate and did separate it, the provision in regard to the reservation of mineral rights and the surface use of the lands by the legislation in 1909, the history shows that it was for the purpose of making available to settlers the right to use those -- the surface.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.543" offset="8673573">And, the settlers were complaining that the minerals -- mineral lands reservation was withholding these lands from their use, that the development of the minerals in the lands would not, in any way, interfere with the use, in -- to a very large extent, of the surface and that they would be -- the one would be separated from the other in the grant that they could make use of large areas of the country which are then -- then --</text>

            <text syncTime="3260.999" offset="13147408">The Union Pacific, as far as I know, has never drilled any -- or any oil on its right of way until this attempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="3292.998" offset="13275408">The grant by Section 2 was a grant of a strip of land 400-feet wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.833" offset="13298709">It's for a named purpose, namely, the construction of a right of way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.607" offset="13317831">Well, I will discuss later the authorities which we maintain, hold, and determine that that is a grant of a fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.868" offset="13350849">The other grant which is entirely separate is a grant of lands, alternate sections on either side of the road, which are called place lands because there were indefinite limits, I suppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.430" offset="13405080">And, those grants are made in the same Act but in a separate section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.926" offset="13423052">Now, as to those grants of these place lands entirely outside the 400-foot strip, there is no doubt but that there is a -- an exception of mineral lands from those place lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.372" offset="13488880">That exception has been given effect consistently in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.273" offset="13520436">Under the Act, after a certain time, a railroad is entitled to receive a patent to those place lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="3370.886" offset="13586892">If they are mineral lands, no patent was issued and that, of course, has happened in many instances.</text>

            <text syncTime="3474.506" offset="14001403">The -- this same Act granted the Central Pacific a similar right of way in place lands.But, between those points, there was no restriction as to where the lines would be built, except Section 8 of the Act which provided that the line must go in the most direct and practicable, I believe the words are “the most direct and practicable route -- continuous route.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4237.384" offset="17052923">The -- we based that conclusion on -- on three different arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.010" offset="17103391">One is the general historical background of this grant, which I had planned to discuss first.</text>
            <text syncTime="4260.229" offset="17144247">The second is the decisions of this Court, which I mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.755" offset="17162428">And, the third is the mineral policy of the United States, which we believe supports our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4273.030" offset="17195447">Now, that was the order in which I had planned to present the case and, if there's time, I would like to present something on each of those three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="4284.218" offset="17240273">Speaking, first, of the historical background of this Act, it's important to consider that the year 1871 was the dividing point in the history of railroad land grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.593" offset="17301713">It was the end of one era and the beginning of another.</text>
            <text syncTime="4304.147" offset="17319999">The objectives of railroad legislation prior to 1871 were succinctly described in the classic work entitled Railroad Transportation by Arthur Twining Hadley, the president of Yale University in 1885.</text>
            <text syncTime="4321.978" offset="17391261">And, he said that early railroad legislation in the United States was devised for the object of securing railroad construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4330.633" offset="17425951">The only theory was that the railroad would not be billed as fast as they were needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4336.268" offset="17448417">Now, it was in order to meet that need that these combined grants which began in the 1950s with Illinois Central Grant, combining a grant of land for a right of way and place lands to help finance the road, was begun.</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.724" offset="17534307">That was the beginning of the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4360.032" offset="17543502">The first of these grants was the Illinois Central Grant of 1850.I should say, however, that that was a grant, as -- as counsel has said, to the State of Illinois but it was on behalf of the Illinois Central Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4373.977" offset="17599300">And, the grant which the Court construed in Illinois Central case in the -- in the Seventh Circuit was the grant from the United States to the State of Illinois which is, of course, the basis of Illinois' title.</text>
            <text syncTime="4389.506" offset="17661367">Illinois then transferred the property to the Illinois Central Railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="4393.531" offset="17677458">It was that grant which the Court of Appeals held conveyed the right of way and fee together with the minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4404.728" offset="17722284">Now, when it came to the time of the civil war, it was obvious that a transcontinental railroad was a necessity, a political and military necessity, to connect California with the rest of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4421.273" offset="17788426">And, there were many intelligent people at that time who thought that a railroad over the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada was an impossibility, that the difficulties would be insurmountable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4435.203" offset="17844224">I think it's important to bear in mind that the purpose of the Union Pacific grant was to induce people to engage in this then hazardous enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4449.725" offset="17902320">And, this Act should be construed with that purpose in mind, with the idea that the purpose of Congress was to induce people to engage in this enterprise, and the first Act was insufficient to accomplish that end.</text>
            <text syncTime="4465.206" offset="17964178">And, in 1864, they had to increase the place lands before it was finally accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="4472.168" offset="17992077">Now, it's been held with the Court, I will cite in a moment, and the Court of Appeals in the present case held that the inclusion of the right of way in this grant was an important part of this inducement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4493.137" offset="18075878">It was in the late of this historical background and in view of this purpose that this Court said in the Great Northern case, which involved the later Act, that when Congress made outright grants of alternate section and along with the grants of the right of way, it was not surprising that the courts had held that the right of way conveyed these grants as limited fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4520.538" offset="18185488">But, the policy which led to this conclusion that these were limited fees was radically changed in 1871.</text>
            <text syncTime="4530.697" offset="18226134">Again, to quote Hadley, “the reaction between 1870 and 1873 was sudden and widespread.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4538.875" offset="18258840">That reaction was brought about, as the Solicitor General said in part, by a pressure of homesteaders who wanted to take up these lands and, as a result, Congress passed a resolution in 1872 that there would be no more place land grants to railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="4559.502" offset="18341386">Another, perhaps more important, reason was that by 1872 or by 1875, the main transcontinental routes had already been laid out and provided for by grants and there was no need for these inducements on place land and other grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4580.738" offset="18426337">However, that -- that was when the Court came to the Great Northern case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4586.182" offset="18448071">They were construing the Act of 1875.</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.725" offset="18470222">The Court, in that case, accepted the premise, which I'll state, that the grants prior to 1871 conveyed limited fees in the rights of way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4603.033" offset="18515466">And, they found that, because of the change of policy and because of the particular provisions which were mentioned by the Solicitor General, that only an easement was conveyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4614.482" offset="18561337">One of those provisions is particularly significant, I mean, of the Act of 1875.</text>
            <text syncTime="4620.585" offset="18585684">That was the provision at the location of each right of way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4623.622" offset="18597909">It should be noted on the plaque in the local land office and, thereafter, any homesteader could acquire title to the land subject to the right of passage of the railroad which, obviously, has characteristics of an easement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4639.207" offset="18660185">But, the point that we make here is that this type of limitation and all the other practice which led the Court to conclude that the 1875 Act conveyed only an easement are totally absent from the 1862 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4659.157" offset="18740015">The 1862 Act made a present absolute grant in granting language of a strip of land 400 feet wide subject to no condition or limitation except that the railroad be built and operated.It was not a grant, in general terms, to permit anyone to construct the railroad anywhere, as was the 1875 Act, but it was a grant to a designated grantee to procure the construction of the railroad between certain designated points.</text>
            <text syncTime="4697.386" offset="18892884">Now, I come to the cases which Your Honor suggested that I refer to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4706.078" offset="18927679">The Court of Appeals, in the present case, noted that the extent of the estate conveyed in the right of way in the pre-1871 grant has been before the Court many times and it cited seven decisions of this Court as being the most important.</text>
            <text syncTime="4726.636" offset="19009912">I believe that there were seven in this Court or perhaps six to this Court and, plus, the Illinois Central case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.957" offset="19043244">The Court of Appeals summed up the holdings of these decisions by saying that, considering the time and circumstances, the history which I've outlined, it must be held that Congress intended to convey a limited fee upon the implied condition of reverter to the United States in the event the company seized to use or retain the land for the purposes for which it was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4762.663" offset="19154004">That was the only limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4766.240" offset="19168319">Now, I do not think it would be necessary nor is there time for me to discuss all seven of these cases, but there are two or three of them that I would like to mention specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="4778.011" offset="19215444">One is the case of New Mexico versus United States Trust Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="4785.602" offset="19245746">In that case -- that case involved a grant to the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Company of 1866.</text>
            <text syncTime="4800.643" offset="19305932">I believe that, later, became Santa Fe.</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.429" offset="19317112">It is practically identical with the Union Pacific grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4807.805" offset="19334562">However, it had a provision in it which excepted the right of way from taxation within the territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4818.526" offset="19377507">The territory of New Mexico claimed that the right of way was an easement and, therefore, the buildings and structures upon it could be taxed as personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4833.191" offset="19436126">So, the power of the territory to tax was held to depend on the nature of the estate granted, that is, whether it was a fee or an easement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.157" offset="19480012">The Court held that the grant was a grant of the land itself, not of a mere right of passage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4850.555" offset="19505612">It based this upon the earlier case of Missouri, Kansas, and Texas -- it based it, in part, on the earlier case of Missouri, Kansas, and Texas versus Roberts in 152 U.S.in which the Court, in passing on a similar grant, decided specifically that it conveyed the fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4869.556" offset="19581576">But, here is the interesting thing about the New Mexico case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4873.443" offset="19597145">New Mexico claimed that, in the Roberts case, the distinction between a fee and easement had not been raised and, therefore, it presumed that I would think they -- to suggest that the Supreme Court had overlooked it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4892.343" offset="19672795">But, the Court held that the issue of title was involved in the Roberts case and said pointedly that the difference between an easement and a fee would not have escaped the attention of the author of the opinion and that of the whole Court with the inevitable consequences which would depend upon such a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4913.525" offset="19757432">Of course, the Court knew what the different consequences that would follow from a fee or an easement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4919.978" offset="19783241">And, in the New Mexico case, it was held that a consequence of fee ownership that the improvements became a part of the realty and, hence, were not taxable as personal property.</text>

            <text syncTime="4958.523" offset="19937468">This had reference to the Northern Pacific right of way which is practically identical with the Union Pacific Right of Way Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4968.432" offset="19977070">Mr. Justice Hughes said, and I want to quote his exact words, “by the grant of Congress, the railroad company obtained the fee in the land constituting the right of way.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4985.929" offset="20047078">With all respect to the Solicitor General, I frankly do not understand how, in his brief, he can brush aside so lightly this very forthright statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="5026.854" offset="20210813">And, if he was -- if the right of way was held solely as an easement, it would have been within the Indian Country.</text>

            <text syncTime="5042.361" offset="20272776">I was careful to say that it was a statement of Mr. Justice Hughes but, as such, to me, it carries a very great deal of weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="5053.587" offset="20317706">Now, the one other case that I would like to discuss is Northern Pacific versus Townsend in 190 U.S.267.</text>
            <text syncTime="5063.985" offset="20359293">This case involved the right of way granted to the Northern Pacific, which I just mentioned, involved the question whether a title to a question of the right of way could be acquired by adverse possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="5077.751" offset="20414360">The Court held that the decision turned upon the nature of the estate granted in the Act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5085.123" offset="20443826">And, on the authority of the New Mexico on other cases specifically held that the fee passed by the grant in Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="5094.442" offset="20481128">There, Your Honor, if I may refer to Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question, is a specific reference to Section 2 of the Great Mellon Act which is identical -- I mean, the Northern Pacific Act which is, we say, identical with the Union Pacific Act and which says that the fee passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5113.852" offset="20558764">Now, of course, it's a matter of common -- it's common in the law for a grant of a fee to be limited or qualified by a condition that the lands will be used for a particular purpose and, at -- upon the cessation of that use, it will revert to the grantor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5135.082" offset="20643715">And, that is exactly what the Court held in the Townsend case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5140.975" offset="20667225">I'd just like to quote this one sentence, “the substantial consideration inducing the grant was the perpetual use of the land for the legitimate purposes of the railroads, just as all the land,” and notice, again, they say “the land,” “had been conveyed in terms to have and to hold the same so long as it was used for railroad right of way.”</text>

            <text syncTime="5633.069" offset="22635604">As I recall it from law school, the possibility of reverter is one thing but a right of reentry for conditions broken is another.</text>

            <text syncTime="5638.853" offset="22658800">That is true, but that has to do with the remedy which the holder of the reversion would apply, namely, whether the reverter would be automatic or whether the holder of the possibility of reverter would have to do something affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="5656.302" offset="22728600">There has never been a decision on that but, as far as I know, it never happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="5659.807" offset="22742601">But, we think it's totally immaterial in this case because, in either of those cases, the rights of the holder of the unlimited or conditional fee is the same, and they are the same as the owner -- as the holder of a title in fee simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="5675.511" offset="22805400">Now, I have yet to come to my answer to counsel's argument that we should read a reservation of minerals into this grant because of mineral policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5697.189" offset="22892126">We think it's vital in this case to distinguish between an exception of mineral lands from a general grant and a reservation of mineral rights from a grant of a particular piece of land.In the case of an exception, nothing would ever passes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5718.207" offset="22976240">The title doesn't pass at all to the excepted lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="5724.123" offset="22999855">But, when you have a grant reserving mineral rights, it brings into play a completely different principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="5730.546" offset="23025560">The title to the land does pass but there is a separation of the underlying minerals from the rest of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5739.283" offset="23060459">Such a case was before the Court, I believe, only a week or two ago or later, Minerals versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5746.705" offset="23090239">That was a case of a mineral reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5749.765" offset="23102464">I don't think it has any relation to this except to illustrate what a mineral reservation is, as compared with an exception of mineral land.</text>
            <text syncTime="5760.978" offset="23147290">Now, the cases cited and relied upon by the Solicitor General regarding the policy are all cases which refer to an exception of mineral lands and there is no suggestion in any of these cases that there was any policy of reserving mineral rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5783.565" offset="23237674">Now, petitioner concedes that that exception of mineral lands could not apply to the right of way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5791.911" offset="23271006">But -- and, it should be added that the grant of the right of way itself contained a no reservation of mineral rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5803.031" offset="23315519">Therefore, petitioner is forced to argue not that mineral land should be excepted from the right of way, but that the Court should read into Section 2 a reservation of mineral rights on the basis of federal policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5820.653" offset="23385945">And, we think the history of the federal policy, which we've outlined in detail in our brief, does not support that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5829.396" offset="23420949">The policy of granting a fee in reserving minerals was not fully developed until 1916, and such a reservation could not have been intended by Congress in 1862.</text>
            <text syncTime="5844.016" offset="23479463">During the last half of the 19th Century, the policy of Congress regarding both mineral and agricultural land was to encourage their development just as rapidly as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="5856.355" offset="23528782">And, Congress believes that the most effective way to do this was to segregate mineral lands on the one hand, and agricultural lands on the other, and provide for a disposition of each class of land under a different set of laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="5871.480" offset="23589282">But, in making this segregation, there was no intention of withholding mineral land from development.</text>
            <text syncTime="5877.973" offset="23615300">On the contrary, the mineral lands could be filed upon and patented after 1866 as readily as agriculture lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="6212.430" offset="24953083">On this matter of -- of mineral policy, the purpose of accepting mineral lands from the operation of -- from the alternate sections was not to prevent the development of the mineral lands, but to keep them from being taken up and patented as agricultural lands, so that they might be patented as mineral lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="6243.037" offset="25075545">The policy of the Government was to patent both types of land under separate laws at nominal prices without any royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="6251.279" offset="25108459">There was no attempt to hold them back.</text>
            <text syncTime="6255.234" offset="25124342">So that, a reservation of minerals in the right of way -- to read in such a reservation of minerals in the right of way would be inconsistent with the federal policy of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="6266.612" offset="25169795">Now, the policy of reserving minerals and granted land, separating the mineral rights from the estate, did not develop until after the withdrawals by President Roosevelt and Taft in the 1900s for reasons which I will not have time to go into but, because the segregation policy had not, at that time, was not working successfully, the -- there had been abuses because coal lands had been taken up as agricultural -- as agricultural lands and, so, those lands were withdrawn until a -- a segregation could be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="6319.240" offset="25380342">As a result of that withdrawal, the Secretary of the Interior, Garfield, in 1907, recommended what he called a brand new policy of separating the minerals and granting the surface.</text>
            <text syncTime="6331.856" offset="25430810">That was a new concept in the history of mineral policy in the United States, and that policy was first put into effect with regard to coal lands in 1862, I beg your pardon, in 1909 and became general in 1916.</text>
            <text syncTime="6354.112" offset="25519835">As to the Stock-Raising Homestead Act, all minerals were excepted from patents under those Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6362.605" offset="25553795">And, the Leasing Act of 1920 completed the -- the development of this new policy of reserving mineral rights in granted lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="6372.560" offset="25593605">And, so, we think it follows that, in 1862, Congress not only did not, but would not, under any circumstances, have reserved minerals from the grant of this right of way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6386.317" offset="25648671">Now, one final point, the Solicitor General has argued that the rule of strict construction prevents the minerals from passing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6398.644" offset="25697991">We had cited the cases in our brief, which I won't have time to discuss, but I will say that it is definitely settled that, as of that period of time, in -- that when the title passed, once the patent was issued, as we said with regard to the place lands, the minerals passed with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6425.421" offset="25805093">It makes no difference whether the title passed by virtue of a patent or by a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6432.384" offset="25832887">We maintain that title passed by the statute of 1862 and these decisions hold that when that title passed, minerals passed without any special mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="6446.580" offset="25889729">It has never been held that there's any rule so strict that a grant by the United States in words which commonly convey a fee do not pass all the incidence of a fee but that there must, in addition to that, be spelled out what go with a grant of a fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="6466.548" offset="25969560">The United States, when it grants land and fee, grants land and fee as anyone else does.</text>

            <text syncTime="6534.949" offset="26243218">We think that the reason the word “Act” was put in there was because, in Sections 9, 13, and 14 there are grants to five other railroads in -- which carry place lands in order to make sure and -- and not to have to repeat the mineral exception in each one of those five grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="6557.701" offset="26334124">It would be perfectly natural for Congress to say, “Well, we'll make this exception here apply to the entire Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6568.195" offset="26376129">But, even though it says that, the physical conditions are such that it couldn't apply to the right of way, as stated and conceded by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="6580.632" offset="26425866">And, in order to get around that, counsel wants the Court to read into the Act a reservation which we claim is a totally different kind of an animal, if you'll pardon the expression, and was not conceived by Congress until -- before 1909 and would never have been thought of then.</text>

            <text syncTime="6786.654" offset="27249977">So that, that explanation seems entirely inadequate for the reason for putting -- for the Congress going through the procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="6794.406" offset="27281011">Now, if the House had only put in “Act” in the first place, that might be one thing, and if that's all the history of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6802.288" offset="27312567">It wouldn't be nearly as convincing, at least to me, as for them to have rejected that selected section and then, in the Senate, put “Act” back and the House accepted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6813.652" offset="27358020">It shows a legislative purpose that should not be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="6817.987" offset="27375365">Now, counsel has also suggested that the Congress was perfectly willing to have these lands made available for mineral rights, the mineral lands, to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="6831.902" offset="27430954">But, this Court has dealt with that very problem and dealt with it in detail concerning the history of these times.</text>
            <text syncTime="6839.224" offset="27460315">And, in the decision of the Mining Company case in 1880 about the California grant, it goes into detail how careful Congress was to try to protect these minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="6848.897" offset="27498977">And, it said “during this period, or from 1849 to 1866, the system of a disposition of the public lands in general had to be introduced in California,” and grants of land were made to the state for various purposes, also, to railroad companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="6865.749" offset="27566373">And, in all these, the attention of Congress was necessarily turned to the distinction between mineral lands and the ordinary agricultural lands of the other western states to which similar laws had applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="6879.863" offset="27622797">This distinction is no more plainly manifested than in this Act of 1853.</text>
            <text syncTime="6886.177" offset="27648084">And, it goes on to say, “We say that this introduce a new principle and preemption for, except in very few cases, no right of preemption had before existed until the lands were surveyed so that the preemptor could designate by the description of the congressional survey the precise land to which this preemption test.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6911.998" offset="27751320">But, this right of preemption on unsurveyed lands was, by this statute, to last but one year, and so careful was Congress to protect mineral lands from sale and preemption that, as we have already shown by the proviso of Section 3 of the Act, the surveyors were forbidden to extend their surveys over them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6939.283" offset="27860511">Now, I'd like to say one word about the 400-foot right of way grant in Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="6948.253" offset="27896351">It might be considered that that is a lavish grant and, therefore, some construction should be made from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6954.855" offset="27922787">It should be assumed that it was intended by Congress to be used for some other purpose than just railroad purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6962.725" offset="27954239">But, that came up during the legislative history of this Act, and the motion was made and amendment was proposed to reduce it to 200 feet, 100 feet on each side.</text>
            <text syncTime="6975.960" offset="28007215">And, it was then explained that it was necessary in some areas of the mine because of the passes and the difficulty of building the road to have the 400 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="6989.054" offset="28059564">And, therefore, it -- the amendment was abandoned and they left it at the 400-foot size, but it was because it was claimed that it was needed for railroad purposes that that was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="7003.829" offset="28118706">Now, I'd like to also call attention to the fact that this Court said in the Great Northern Railway case that if the railroad tried to get a right of way by eminent domain, it got nothing but an easement, which seems to me important in trying to construe what would be intended in a situation of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="7028.193" offset="28216195">Now, the Government doesn't deny that a very valuable part of the inducement of this building of this railroad was this right of way, but it wasn't the gas and oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="7040.609" offset="28265827">It wasn't the gold or the silver or any precious minerals that were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="7046.133" offset="28287875">The inducement was the fact that you just couldn't get a right of way across the lands of the United States unless it was granted to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="7055.262" offset="28324446">You can't get anything like that by eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="7058.698" offset="28338134">And, therefore, it was absolutely necessary that they get such a right in order to build the railroad, but they were interested and it was a vital importance politically and to the war itself that was going on that this railroad be built.</text>
            <text syncTime="7076.161" offset="28408038">But, in spite of such client, the Congress was careful to try to protect the country in regard to these mineral rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="7103.755" offset="28518379">But I'm also impressed by the fact, in reading your assertion, that various judges, various members of this Court, and at least one or two Congresses, with land problems more particularly on mind, so that this particular problem did characterize this, what was different in Section 2 has a grant which is, in scope, very different from a mere right of passage.</text>
            <text syncTime="7136.416" offset="28648991">Indeed, in one of the opinions which Mr. Justice makes the distinction between a mere right of passage and easement to a natural person and what was given here to the railroad for public purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="7145.557" offset="28685563">What I would like to ask of you is whether such -- if such a, what shall I say, an additive for this grant by judges when their minds weren't on it but they read the statute innocent, whether that is already -- already an important language and weighty testimony or as I come to reading this statute in the light of urging that it's certainly time to try and find out what the interests are.</text>

            <text syncTime="7179.993" offset="28823385">Well, I think it is, insofar as it was necessary to the holding in a particular case, but it seems to me that the Court was trying to solve that problem and it -- and then, went back to the general law or language of conveyance instead of directing its attention to what the intent of the Congress was in the specific Act and what they were trying to accomplish, as this Court has done over the years in trying to construe Congressional Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="7212.761" offset="28954415">And, if they did that, you wouldn't have to characterize the estate in any way in order to give the protection that was necessary in each of those cases in order to maintain the railroad.</text>
