            <text syncTime="26.094" offset="207705">In connection with one question that was asked with reference to when Mr. Chessman learned that Stanley Fraser was related to Mr. Leavy.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.533" offset="265488">There's a series of -- of pieces of information about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.132" offset="287848">The -- there was a letter and I -- it's in the petitioner's Exhibit Number 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.327" offset="312717">There was letter written to Mr. Chessman in -- in July of 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.906" offset="355035">This letter -- I'm not sure that this letter was -- was allowed in evidence but I believe I know it's in this file at least for identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.120" offset="387845">And in connection with this subject, it was a letter from Emily Matthews who was the wife of the man who sat as an adviser during Chessman's trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.054" offset="439568">In the course of that letter --</text>

          <turn speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="85.734" stopTime="86.937">
            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="85.734" offset="446360">Adviser to whom?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_t_davis" startTime="86.937" stopTime="341.679">
            <label>Mr. George T. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="86.937" offset="451166">As an adviser to Mr. Chessman.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.020" offset="463496">In the course of that letter, she said, and it appears just above in the middle of this handwritten page, "The record is in sad page, they have the third man on it now, and Al is quite elated as he is M. L. wife's cousin.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.339" offset="544684">Now, this is clarified by a later statement by Mr. Chessman.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.174" offset="560044">They have the third man on and he is M. L. wife's cousin.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.675" offset="582092">Subsequently, a letter was written to Mr. Chessman on October the 12th, 1948, which incidentally was after that letter that had been sent by Mr. Persons (ph), that court reporter, who said that these notes were undecipherable.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.549" offset="641546">This came to Mr. Chessman from Al Matthews and he says, "The judge told me when the record was completed he was going to bring you down here for the purpose of having an agreed settlement of the record."</text>
            <text syncTime="150.089" offset="703718">Now, that was a letter from Mr. Matthews.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.714" offset="714271">I must say in fairness to Judge Fricke, that Judge Fricke did testify that Mr. Matthews had apparently misunderstood him.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.917" offset="747081">But that, of course, was not known to Mr. Chessman in anyway because that's the letter that he received from Mr. Matthews.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.950" offset="771218">Now, I go to Mr. Chessman's testimony in the hearings before Judge Goodman.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.815" offset="794624">And at the time he was testifying, Ms.Asher who was interrogating him said to him, "Did you at that time" -- speaking now of the July, 1948 letter from Emily, “Did you at that time relate that reference to M. L.'s wife's cousin to Stanley Fraser?"</text>
            <text syncTime="195.514" offset="885426">Chessman said, "I had never heard the name Stanley Fraser in my life so I was unable to do so."</text>
            <text syncTime="202.851" offset="914787">"When did you first hear the name Stanley Fraser?"</text>
            <text syncTime="206.262" offset="928371">Answer "Some time shortly before, so far as I can recall, the transcripts were filed."</text>
            <text syncTime="212.845" offset="954702">Now, I am referring not to the augmented record but to the original transcripts under the original contract which was in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.742" offset="994304">I don't remember exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.153" offset="999946">"Now, Mr. Chessman, when did you first learn of the relationship between Mr. Stanley Fraser and Mr. J. M. Leavy?</text>
            <text syncTime="233.553" offset="1037563">Answer "Some time in May of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.224" offset="1060237">I was at San Quentin and I had a date."</text>
            <text syncTime="242.123" offset="1071835">And I am reading incidentally from pages 572 and 573 of this record, Volume 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.492" offset="1105377">"I -- I was at San Quentin and I had a date for execution in a few more days.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.103" offset="1127737">I had retained Berwyn Rice as counsel who was the first attorney I'd had since these proceedings began."</text>
            <text syncTime="262.623" offset="1153860">He told me he'd just returned from a trip to Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.873" offset="1166817">During the course of the investigation down there, he asked me first, did I know that the reporter who had prepared this record was related to the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.840" offset="1206732">And I told him no, that I didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.062" offset="1215613">And he said well, I have information that he is.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.094" offset="1231705">Now, Mrs. -- Ms. Asher proceeded to ask him one further question and asked him whether he knew or whether he didn't know when that original letter said that he was M. L.'s cousin that he was referring that -- that Emily was referring to Miller Leavy.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.382" offset="1296906">And he answered, in the course of his questioning, that he didn't know that because he assumed, he said here -- he said that he assumed from the letter that this was the third man working on the notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.810" offset="1358660">He didn't know that that was the man who actually was retained or would be retained to transcribe the notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.737" offset="1386350">And so, he didn't put it together and, of course, M. L.'s cousin meant nothing to him so far as Fraser was concerned until his own counsel told him about it for the first time in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.312" offset="1440580">Then I -- I call your attention to Volume 6, the testimony of Mr. Fraser --</text>

            <text syncTime="598.943" offset="2499166">Because we are concerned with the question of counsel here and a very long and a very voluminous record, we must look at the totality of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.198" offset="2536155">And the first thing I'd like to discuss is the method by which the record was prepared, a method approved incidentally by a California court in construing a California statute in the California rules upon appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.860" offset="2586833">Now, when reporter Perry died, he being the reporter who had lived during that trial and taken all the notes, the California court was confronted with a most unique situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.548" offset="2633540">A new trial was impossible for the reason that the grounds for new trial in California are purely statutory and no new trial was permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.667" offset="2662066">The California Supreme Court has so stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.820" offset="2674604">Discharge of the prisoner, maybe that occurred to somebody, but that was impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.311" offset="2692577">This was a -- a most serious charge and kidnapping had been found against him on two counts and a death penalty had been imposed, so that was impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.968" offset="2731238">Now, there was a third thing that might have been done and that rested with the petitioner himself, Mr. Chessman.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.209" offset="2756211">Under the California Rules upon Appeal, he had the right under Rule 36 to make application to Judge Fricke to prepare a settled statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.602" offset="2801768">That was not done.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.801" offset="2810546">There was no way then, and I know of no way now by which he could have been compelled to do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1105.003" offset="4523342">But in any event, this was a method that was compelled under our rules on appeal as construed by our courts and our state court has held that this method adopted under California law was a fair method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.705" offset="4582170">Now, when we talks in term for so -- fairness, I think we're talking in terms of due process at least at this beginning stage of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.445" offset="4613204">And so, the method adopted, the method compelled was a method that has been held to be valid under California law, California law which conferred the appeal in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.073" offset="4655626">Now, as to the manner in which the trial transcript was prepared, that -- that just wasn't happenstance that Mr. Fraser was employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.163" offset="4696064">He wasn't walking down the street and he wasn't selected out of a crowd to do this job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.641" offset="4717902">When reporter Perry died, the seriousness of the problem confronting the appellate aspects of this case were apparent to all, the judge and the prosecuting attorney and to Mr. Chessman, himself, who asked that the proceedings be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.987" offset="4779342">And so, the notes were given to other reporters in the Los Angeles County Court House Building and a reporter by the name of Gerni (ph) read them and she voiced the opinion that they were capable of being transcribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.431" offset="4833050">She would not undertake the test, however, because she had daily duties to attend to and she didn't want to get involved in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.023" offset="4859486">Now, Mr. Fraser was selected, first of all, because he had formerly works in common employment with Mr. Perry, the dead reporter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1229.393" offset="5020923">Now, before reporter Fraser began, these facts must be taken into consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.048" offset="5051538">Before he died, reporter Perry had dictated on to a recording device, the first 646 pages of this transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.922" offset="5091035">The first 646 pages of the transcript were transcribed as they always had been in the past by his long time transcriber one Grace Peter Michael.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.727" offset="5134294">So that whether reporter ,Perry, had lived or whether he had died, the first 646 pages would have been transcribed in the same manner as appears in the record before this Court and as was reviewed by the California Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1330.249" offset="5424358">There was a question about the competency of Fraser by Mr. Chessman in his long continuing series of attacks upon the man's character and ability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.093" offset="5459780">But this Court specifically directed an inquiry into the question of fraud and collusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.326" offset="5480678">And Mr. Fraser was exposed to all of the questions and all of the examinations of Mr. Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.463" offset="5505233">And he was attacked as to ability and to character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.555" offset="5517563">And all that I've just related came out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.646" offset="5533968">To begin with, Mr. Perry's style of penmanship was what we call "copperplate".</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.363" offset="5556851">Those are the words of a man, named Paul Berdict (ph), who testified as an expert before Judge Goodman and who said that his notes were of the best quality and quite legible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.598" offset="5597811">Now, Mr. Fraser testified before Judge Goodman as to his prior experience with Perry in reading his notes, how they had been life long friends, how they had worked for a common employer in Seattle, and how they had a room together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.835" offset="5650683">And after all of that was done, they even examined the method by which Mr. Fraser prepared these particular transcript pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.053" offset="5683597">And they found, true, that he consulted the notes of Judge Fricke.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.187" offset="5704077">Well, that was approved in the Miller case decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.720" offset="5718288">He did talk to some of the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.656" offset="5726020">That apparently is approved by the Miller case, decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.165" offset="5740022">And he used other sources of material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.978" offset="5751306">And after all that that was done, the Court found that the record was prepared, not only by Mr. Fraser but with the assistance of Leavy and Fricke in an eminently fair manner and that Mr. Fraser was especially confident and qualified to prepare the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.595" offset="5813791">Now, before the page was closed on a preparation of the record, there was another man who made his entry into the preparation of it and that was Mr. Chessman himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.489" offset="5853288">Mr. Chessman was furnished a complete copy of the reporter's transcript, he being at San Quentin State Prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.667" offset="5882023">And he read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.490" offset="5885367">We have to presume he read it because here was a man who knew that his fate is continued, right to live would depend upon whether or not he could discover some material errors in the transcript that was delivered to him at San Quentin State Prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.442" offset="5941164">And so, he read it and he forward it to Judge Fricke, a document, legal size, double-spaced comprising approximately 28 pages, and there, he set forth all of his objections to the transcript as prepared by Fraser.</text>

            <text syncTime="1579.054" offset="6419623">And in that affidavit, he said that he had been duped by Judge Fricke and prosecutor Leavy into thinking that he would be present at the hearing before Judge Fricke to settle the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.974" offset="6471241">Now, if there is sought to be established any state action from that, to begin with, it wasn't a promise from Leavy to Chessman made in his presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.697" offset="6510111">It was language taken from an affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.216" offset="6520247">Secondly, if it is any kind of a promise, there has to be some reliance upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.811" offset="6538637">Now, if Chessman knew on April 3rd, 1949 that he would not be present in Court and he must have known it because he said in the affidavit that he had been duped into thinking he would be present, then, it was his duty, if time were remaining, to take legal steps to compel his presence in Court to take those steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.662" offset="6625991">He said on April 3rd, 1949, he had been duped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.770" offset="6638425">The transcript was settled on June 1st, June 2nd, and June 3rd of 1949 so that he have the time period from April 3rd, 1949 to June 1st, 1949 within which to make application to some California court to order his person produced before Judge Fricke, and he did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.770" offset="6726405">He applied once to the California Supreme Court to be produced and they denied it without prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.585" offset="6753677">And he, by this time, knew full well but without prejudice manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.217" offset="6768201">Now, further, he could not, for a moment, have entertained the notion that he would be produced or that the transcript would be delivered to him in Judge Fricke's court for the reason that it was in fact delivered to him at San Quentin State Prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.322" offset="6820655">That's where he took delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.166" offset="6828074">So as to that fabricated promise and as to this notion of reliance, the facts disclosed that it just is not so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1750.141" offset="7103927">Now, at that time following arrest and arraignment, Chessman was represented by the deputy public defender, the first public defender's office in United States was established in Los Angeles, by the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.562" offset="7169651">And later on, before the trial commenced, 48 days before the trial begin, as a matter of fact, this took place in the courtroom.</text>

            <text syncTime="1777.279" offset="7212492">Chessman, "I think so."</text>

            <text syncTime="1781.378" offset="7228897">The defendant, Chessman, "I think I am a good enough lawyer."</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.842" offset="7242689">The Court, "You don't want to trust it to a lawyer?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.942" offset="7255124">Chessman, "I don't want to do it."</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.322" offset="7264632">And then some more, and it's quite clear from that, that he insisted upon representing himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.678" offset="7286053">And then again he said this, at another p oint in the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.376" offset="7300890">This is Chessman speaking, "I wish to point out that it is my intention to act in propria persona at this time and to continue to do so until such time as it is legally established that I am not qualified to do so and that I will not accept a court appointed attorney."</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.050" offset="7375600">Now, that's how the trial began, Chessman representing himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.923" offset="7395035">And if there's any question, whatsoever, of -- of a competent rejection of counsel or if you want to put in terms of labor, consider this, this is not an ignorance, or an illiterate, or an uninformed, or misguided, or coerced individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.696" offset="7458147">On the contrary, here's a man of intelligence so described by Judge Goodman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.806" offset="7478627">In fact, Judge -- Judge Denman said that his briefs would do credit to an experienced criminal practitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.364" offset="7504854">That's the man who pushed away the aid of counsel at the beginning of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.547" offset="7521573">Now, when he did that, he was unnoticed of what California law was.</text>

            <text syncTime="1941.643" offset="7869942">In the Johnston case, the Court was dealing with the habeas corpus case of course and the question was whether the prisoner was entitled to make an oral argument upon appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.453" offset="7909230">And this Court said that in that case, it was discretionary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2287.484" offset="9253282">And in his opening brief, which we have quoted on page 27 or our brief, he again asserts his position to appear personally.</text>

            <text syncTime="2412.468" offset="9753266">The California Supreme Court said that that was the case and every single court that has reviewed this question without exception has said that he does not have a right onto the due process requirements or under equal protection or under any other theory to be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.977" offset="9815228">And the reason for that is quite obvious.</text>

            <text syncTime="2433.088" offset="9835708">Now, getting back to what occurred before Judge Fricke, if the transcript had been prepared, if it had not been given to Chessman, if he had not have the time and opportunity to read it, and if he not submitted a long list of written objections which were then filed before this Court, that would be a far different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.864" offset="9910836">The record would have been settled without his voice being heard, but his voice was heard and here's the interesting about all of his objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.378" offset="9948871">We say, well he didn't put a certain objection in -- in the courtroom adverse of that, and a way to believe that knowing that his life was at stake in this proceeding, if an objection didn't occur to him or if for some reason, he was playing a cat and mouse game with his own life that -- that is something we cannot control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.503" offset="10021386">But every single objection that he put into his list of omissions and inaccuracies was allowed or disallowed by Judge Fricke and then most minutely reviewed by the California court and they said, allowing everyone of his objections, it would not have affected the result upon appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2585.268" offset="10444466">But the judge instructed the jury that if they found that he has committed the attorney charge, they must render a verdict for the best interest although such is going on, et cetera.</text>

            <text syncTime="2967.015" offset="11971480">And we talked about the notes being accurate and what Judge Goodman permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.381" offset="11988929">Let's look at it this way, the charges made that Judge Fricke said, "Bring in the death penalty."</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.186" offset="12008155">Now, to demonstrate that he didn't say it, proof was taken in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.541" offset="12033546">Now, the notes, as transcribed, don't contain it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3096.386" offset="12488913">But all I can say again is that, well, I'd like to go into another point if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.041" offset="12523499">Now, so far as the due process is concerned, we're dealing here with -- with an appeal and this Court have said that the State need not confer an appeal but just so it's conferred equally to all -- the requirements of the Federal Constitution are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.001" offset="12591417">Now, I cited the case of Avery against Alabama in the brief in the -- that presents an instance where a man who was arrested, arraigned, tried, and convicted within a period of four days.He was represented by a court appointed counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.563" offset="12657664">They had asked for additional time to make a better defense and upon conviction, that became the basis for a motion for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.977" offset="12687235">And this Court said in the Avery case that because on the motion for a new trial, there was no showing made that a different or better defense would have occurred, therefore, there was not like a due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.339" offset="12736763">Now, let's relate the philosophy of that case to the present situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.498" offset="12757347">The California Supreme Court had said that even allowing all of the inaccuracies and omissions of Chessman, the result upon appeal would not have been affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.439" offset="12809174">Judge Goodman reviewed the somewhat startling claims of fraud, collusion, conspiracy, improper use of notes, improper consultation with witnesses, and he found a reporter eminently qualified, he found no such mandatory death penalty, instruction had been given, and in short, that the best possible record was prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.506" offset="12893393">And In fact, there was no showing ever made that the record that's prepared wasn't in fact a better record than would have been prepared by the dead reporter, Perry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.818" offset="12930696">So, that we have here, in addition of those things, the voice of Chessman himself at the settlement hearing in the document which I just picked up, all of his list of objections and things that should be disallowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.767" offset="12990464">Now, never at anytime throughout the nine or ten-year course of this case has he been able to do anymore than say, “I have the right to be present but don't call upon me to prove what different result would obtained, and I have made allegations in the past which have been upon scrutiny by the courts destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.369" offset="13084818">But I still assert that I have the bare right to have the entire proceeding reversed, why, because I was not there even though I can't show a different result."</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.760" offset="13126405">Now, we don't think that's the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.366" offset="13136854">The California Supreme Court in reviewing his record and his list of omissions said that they were looking to the record on appeal to determine any substantial errors which would call -- cause a reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.627" offset="13189831">Now, this Court in the due process cases, particularly dealing with counsel reverses only when there is some error has been made out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.696" offset="13230164">And if there hasn't been error made out to the prejudice of the defendant, the result is usually affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.501" offset="13253360">Now, we're dealing here with a process which admittedly is unique but it's created by a State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.634" offset="13281886">And we concede, perhaps, it isn't ideal although there's no showing made that it isn't perfectly suited to the role that you'd fill on appeal, and perhaps, it doesn't need every conceivable hardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.727" offset="13330265">But recall now that this remedy was taken by California or this procedure because among other reasons, Chessman himself elected not to furnish to the trial court his version of what went on.And so, we were compelled to do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4217.705" offset="16974242">Now, I can only emphasize to the Court again the State determinations of the contentions here, the prior federal determinations and if California had any notion that what we did was less than completely fair here or if we have any notion as to guilt, we'd be the first to say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4240.266" offset="17064417">But we consider that under the standards of this Court as to state procedures that there can be no valid criticism of that which we did.</text>

            <text syncTime="4266.206" offset="17168175">That as a result of the habeas corpus proceeding, this present proceeding, there's been a developed material which everybody seems to recognize, it was not in Chessman's possession at the time of the state court review of this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4282.990" offset="17235362">And that therefore, the state court has never passed upon the settlement of that record in light of (a), the interviewing of these witnesses by the prosecutor and -- and the stenographer and (b), the relationship between Chessman between the stenographer and the prosecutor.</text>
