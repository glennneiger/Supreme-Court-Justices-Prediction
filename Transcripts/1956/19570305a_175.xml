            <label>Mr. Thomas I. Emerson</label>
            <text syncTime="24.662" offset="202062">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.743" offset="214392">This is an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Hampshire upholding appellant's conviction of contempt in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.427" offset="249083">The contempt arose out of appellant's refusal to answer certain questions which were propounded to him by the Attorney General of New Hampshire acting in the capacity of a legislative investigating committee which was investigating subversive activities in New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.276" offset="340511">Appellant answered all the questions with regard to the user advocacy of force or violence to overthrow Government and also all questions with respect to membership or influence of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.458" offset="405191">But he refused to answer certain questions as to the contents of a lecture on socialism which he had given at the University of New Hampshire and also, on the activities of his wife and two others in the formation and operation of the progressive party in New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.886" offset="486902">The basic issue is whether appellant can be forced by a state legislative investigating committee to answer questions which go beyond the area of force and violence and Communist activity and would seek to probe into the area of academic discussion and lawful political organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.207" offset="572165">There are three issues on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.985" offset="583346">First Amendment issue, a due process issue, and the question whether federal legislation has preempted the field under the Pennsylvania against Nelson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.236" offset="640293">There is also a jurisdictional issue and the Court postponed consideration of jurisdiction until argument on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.252" offset="676342">Since that order of the Court was issued, I think the jurisdictional question has been pretty well settled by a certificate issued by the Supreme Court of New Hampshire which appears on the last page of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.850" offset="750738">There was never any issue with respect to the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.725" offset="770278">That issue was raised from the beginning, pressed through out and passed upon by the New Hampshire Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.473" offset="797236">The due process issue if I -- I'm -- I should say that when I refer to First Amendment, I -- I mean of course the First Amendment as made applicable to the States under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.812" offset="850631">The due process issue was presented to the New Hampshire Supreme Court and passed upon it in its original opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.565" offset="889605">The only question arose with respect to the preemption issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.473" offset="905279">This question for reasons which I need not go into here was not presented to the New Hampshire Supreme Court until a second motion for rehearing which was denied by the New Hampshire Supreme Court without opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.685" offset="962121">It was in that state of the record that the jurisdictional statement was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.422" offset="981034">Since then, however, the Supreme Court of New Hampshire has issued the certificate which appears on Page 78, the last page of our brief in which they say they certify that they considered on the merits the second petition for rehearing and unanimously denied it because the Court was not satisfied that Pennsylvania against Nelson purported to preclude a state legislative investigation of subversive activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.460" offset="1109243">In light of the Rosenberg against California and similar cases, I think it is clear that the New Hampshire Supreme Court did pass upon the federal question and passed exclusive and rested its decision in fact exclusively on the federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.132" offset="1179878">And that therefore, the jurisdictional issue is disposed off.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.726" offset="1198268">I might add that the position of the Supreme Court of New Hampshire with respect to this preemption question was considered in a case subsequent to the Sweezy case in Kahn against Wyman which is printed in our brief at page 76.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.086" offset="1279666">And that in this case, a per curiam opinion, they did consider in a such -- such detail as I wish to give it the preemption issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.749" offset="1326373">The Attorney General of New Hampshire raises no question with respect to jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.020" offset="1351450">Now, getting to the merits then, it would be necessary for me to develop further the facts with respect to this inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.128" offset="1399933">There are two New Hampshire statutes involved.One is the Subversive Activities act of 1951 which is reprinted in our brief beginning at page 62.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.823" offset="1458657">This statute is in two parts, a Sedition Act and a loyalty program.Let me summarize it briefly without attempting the full refinement of the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.179" offset="1528038">It provides that it shall be a felony punishable up to 20 years in prison to do three things, commit any act intended to overthrow or alter the constitutional form of government of the United States for the State of New Hampshire by force or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.030" offset="1607450">Two, to advocate or cage by any means, any person to commit or assist in the commission of such an act or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.325" offset="1644648">And third, to assist in the formation or participate in the management or contribute to the support of any -- of any subversive organization and a subversive organization is defined as one that has engaged in the prohibited acts of violence or in the prohibited advocacy or teaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.523" offset="1729494">Now, for our purposes, the -- the key provision of the statute is the definition of subversive person which appears on page 63.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.722" offset="1786232">A subversive person is defined as anyone who commits any of the prohibited acts or engages in the prohibited advocacy or teaching or is a member of the subversive organization or including a foreign subversive organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.100" offset="1855822">The chief significance of the definition of subversive person as it appeared in the original statute here was in relation to the loyalty program, no subversive person could be employed in the state government but the definition gave -- added significance from the second statute which I will -- that I'll mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.519" offset="1945475">The loyalty program simply provided that no person who was a subversive person could hold public office or be employed in New Hampshire and was enforced -- enforced through investigatory procedures and loyalty oaths.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.586" offset="2021752">Now, the second statute is entitled a joint resolution relating to the investigation of subversive activities was passed two years later in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.856" offset="2066787">There were no prosecutions, as I understand it, under the 1951 Sedition Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.351" offset="2088730">But in 1953, the legislature passed a joint resolution of investigation and this authorized and directed the Attorney General to investigate two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.628" offset="2141915">One, to make a full and complete investigation with respect to violations of the Subversive Activities Act of 1951, that is investigate violations of the 1951 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.559" offset="2193638">And two, to determine whether subversive persons as defined in that Act are presently located within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.765" offset="2234389">The authority to investigate subversive persons was no longer limited to state employees, but included any person within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.168" offset="2276080">The Attorney General was given the subpoena power, but it was enforceable only by application to the Superior Court of New Hampshire for a court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.815" offset="2314637">Now, the two statutes have been interpreted by the New Hampshire Supreme Court in a decision prior to the Sweezy decision involving another witness before the Attorney General, known as Nelson against 199 New Hampshire 33.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.439" offset="2393109">The interpretation was that the -- the 1953 Act, the resolution of investigation, delegated to the Attorney General of New Hampshire the legislative power of investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.702" offset="2454131">In other words, that he was not conducting the investigation acting as an executive official but acting as a legislative investigating committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.419" offset="2493001">The other interpretation was this, that whereas under the first Act, no felony would be involved without knowledge and willfulness, so far as the definition of subversive person was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.223" offset="2564263">A person could be a subversive -- a subversive person whether or not his action or advocacy or teaching or membership was knowing and willful.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.855" offset="2606791">In other words, an innocent member of an organization would come within the definition of subversive person and therefore, be subject to investigation, so much for the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.910" offset="2675022">Now, appellant was a resident of New Hampshire.He was a graduate of Harvard and obtained his doctor's degree in economics at Harvard in 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.673" offset="2722043">He taught on the Harvard Faculty for eight years until the outbreak of the war.He went into military service and at the end of military service, became a resident of New Hampshire and had since engaged in research and writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.823" offset="2786617">He is a co-editor of the Journal of Opinion, Monthly Review.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.705" offset="2810232">Dr. Sweezy is a distinguished economist and a well-known authority on socialism.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.118" offset="2831862">He's the author of a standard text on socialism, as well as some other books on capitalism, socialism and Marxism.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.362" offset="2868851">In political orientation, he is a Marxist and a socialist.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.384" offset="2892884">Dr. Sweezy was called before the Attorney -- Attorney General on two occasions, in January and June 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.541" offset="2929560">In an opening statement on the first occasion, Dr. Sweezy made clear to the Committee his position with respect to the interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.868" offset="2974804">After giving his reasons, he stated that he would answer certain questions about himself, although not conceding the right to ask them.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.883" offset="3014928">And he also said that he would answer questions with respect to force and violence to overthrow the Government but not other conduct which he considered to be lawful or protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.514" offset="3073442">Appellant adhered to this position throughout the two hearings at least so far as -- as a witness under those circumstances consistently could.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.260" offset="3116387">He answered a number of questions in line with this pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.854" offset="3134777">He answered all questions dealing with the use or advocacy or force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.562" offset="3157661">He testified that he had never used or advocated force or violence or assisted any group which advocated force or violence or knew any person in New Hampshire or any group which advocated force or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.649" offset="3217951">He also answered questions with respect to the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.846" offset="3238745">The 1951 statute had contained legislative findings of fact that the Communist Party engaged in acts of violence and other similar acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.548" offset="3289527">And in order to eliminate the question of the relationship of the Communist Party to use of force and violence, appellant answered questions that related to the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.628" offset="3337906">He testified that he was never a member of the Communist Party, was not at the time a member, had never attended any meetings, made any contributions and did not know any persons in New Hampshire to be members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.648" offset="3393912">He likewise testified with respect to questions concerning Communist Party influence on the Progressive Party, saying, he did not know of any such influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.501" offset="3453367">Appellant also answered a number of questions with respect to himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.102" offset="3471757">He testified that he was a member or had been associated in some ways such as writing or making speeches for a number of organizations listed by the Committee on Un-American Activities and a number listed by the Attorney General of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.110" offset="3543855">He testified that at the time of the hear -- that at the time of the hearing, he was not a member of any organization on the Attorney General's list.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.862" offset="3578859">Now, the Attorney General of New Hampshire apparently disagrees with some of these statements of fact I have made with respect to what the record shows as to the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.743" offset="3626297">He contends that my statement that appellant testified with respect to matters concerning force and violence and with respect to advocacy, membership and influence of the Communist Party is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.023" offset="3695470">Without -- I -- he submits no specified portions of the record in -- to support his statement, except these two.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.206" offset="3740191">One, a question which was asked, “Do you believe in Communist?”</text>
            <text syncTime="913.324" offset="3756701">Which appellant refused to answer on First Amendment grounds, although he later answered in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.533" offset="3781465">That is a question of belief and is not involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.711" offset="3798183">The other question was, “Were Communist --</text>

            <text syncTime="1448.049" offset="5895607">Briefly, my argument on the First Amendment is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.549" offset="5917550">The First Amendment is applicable as a limitation on the power of state legislative investigating committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.195" offset="5952136">And the standard by which the amendment is to be applied is the standard set forth in the Quinn case, namely that a legislative committee may not investigate in an area where it may not legislate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.262" offset="6012426">And thirdly, that in this case, the Attorney General has intruded in areas which would be foreclosed to state control by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.261" offset="6064462">And that therefore, the -- the appellant was justified in refusing to answer the questions because they went beyond an area in which the Attorney General of New Hampshire was constitutionally authorized to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.154" offset="6127992">Now, let me develop the argument a little further and then attempt to answer my appellant's contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.535" offset="6165504">I take it that it is unnecessary to deal at any length with the impact upon freedom of political expression in actual fact of the operation of legislative investigating committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.831" offset="6226735">It seems to me that experience has made quite clear that the power to call a witness before a committee to subject him to a series of questions by skilled interrogators and then to publish what amount to official government findings with respect to his conduct or actions or associations, clearly, impose sanctions upon freedom of speech and freedom of expression and freedom of association, which can be and in this area are most devastating.</text>

            <text syncTime="1874.440" offset="7601089">But I say I'm -- I'm not because the First Amendment operating through the Fourteenth operates as a limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.754" offset="7642363">Now, a -- a word or two with respect to the legal standard or doctrine by which the First Amendment limitation becomes applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.593" offset="7701713">There are various theories of this but I will discuss only the one which was most recently stated by this Court in the Quinn case where the Court said that the power of talking there of congressional legislative investigation does not extend to an area in which Congress is forbidden to legislate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.577" offset="7797635">This was in line with Mr. Chief Justice Hughes' opinion in Electric Bond &amp; Share case where he also had said that information bearing on activities which are within the range of congressional power may be subject to either legislative or administrative investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.057" offset="7871613">The standard applies also to the States, certainly, where the States purport to enter an area that is forbidden to them by the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.536" offset="7921560">I think the rule is a sound one for -- for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.315" offset="7948622">Let me just state this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.993" offset="7959385">The process of investigation itself as I've just indicate operates as a restriction or a regulation particularly in the field of First Amendment pointer, a field of political expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.560" offset="8025631">And since it operates as a restriction or a legislation, it should be told by the same rules with respect to formal legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.966" offset="8067218">Furthermore, the power of investigation is a subsidiary or ancillary power to be exercised only in aid of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.210" offset="8112253">And therefore, the lesser power of investigating should not be allowed to expand beyond the greater power of legislative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.879" offset="8162931">Now, that brings me to the question of the application of this area standard to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.113" offset="8199816">I am willing to concede that there may be cases in which the question can be difficult, but I submit it is not so here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.153" offset="8235969">First with respect to the lecture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.349" offset="8248717">As I have said, the appellant answered questions with regard to use or advocacy of force or violence, advocacy of Communism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.098" offset="8291767">The other -- other testimony in the record indecently supports appellant's testimony on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.375" offset="8332831">The questions with regard to force and violence, having thus been answered, the Attorney General went on and asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.723" offset="8366268">“Well, what did you say?</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.379" offset="8376926">What was the subject of your lecture?</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.788" offset="8386539">Did you say that socialism was inevitable?</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.871" offset="8398869">Did you discuss dialectical materialism?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.696" offset="8410154">And so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.775" offset="8422484">He thereby stepped over the boundary of the area in which the State had authority to legislate and proceeded into an area in which the State had no authority because it was dealing with academic discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.233" offset="8496253">The State has authority to prohibit force and violence, and under the doctrine of the Dennis case to prohibit the advocacy of force and violence under certain conditions, but it has no power to limit academic discussion of -- of -- along peaceful lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.528" offset="8585488">And this was the area in which these questions intrude.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.098" offset="8607744">Now, let me make one subsidiary point here before I pass to the Attorney General's answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.852" offset="8650794">This was not an investigation of the curriculum at the University of New Hamsphire or the manner of teaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.420" offset="8681096">It was an investigation into subversive activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.328" offset="8696665">Now, true, teachers could be investigated if they were engaged in subversive activities as well as anyone else but I want to emphasize that this does not involve the power of the State to make rules with respect to the curriculum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.537" offset="8753507">It doesn't involve the question of whether New Hamsphire wants socialism taught in its schools or -- or to discuss in its schools and from the point of view, whether that's sound educational policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.223" offset="8800214">That the Attorney General had no power in that field and the Supreme Court of New Hamsphire expressly recognized so.This is a question of his power with respect to subversive activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.969" offset="8855280">Now, the Attorney General has two arguments in answer to the position I have just expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.125" offset="8903868">The first is that appellant's writings and associations for such action justify a further pro.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.451" offset="8941171">The argument as I understand it is that appellant is the kind of a person as shown by his writings and associations that he has a propensity to advocate force and violence and therefore, you can inquire further about what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.296" offset="9008567">Now, I -- I will not discuss this in any detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.323" offset="9032704">I think I would simply say that there is no basis in either fact or theory for this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.536" offset="9053497">There is nothing in appellant's writings which indicate in anyway that he ever engaged or thought to engage in advocacy of force or violence with respect to the United States Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2398.781" offset="9698513">Now, my position is that that is incorrect, that the rule of the area test is that when you cross the boundary into a protected area, you must start whether it's relevant or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2590.951" offset="10467140">Nevertheless, the Attorney General went much too far in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.460" offset="10489187">And I say that the interest of the State of New Hampshire in cross examining appellant with respect to these matters as an aid to legislation on this questions was far outweighed by the damage that was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.749" offset="10554389">If the Attorney General wanted to prove that appellant's answers were wrong, he had the possibility of a perjury of prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.788" offset="10590542">And the perjury prosecution should -- could establish the integrity of a legislative investigation in this sort of a situation if it were called for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.142" offset="10635891">Furthermore, the kind of questions which this type of cross examination would -- would -- are involved are not the kind that are normally necessary to a legislative committee investigating in aid of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.893" offset="10718960">These are questions which go to the details of particular cases which might be relevant in an adjudicatory or an administrative proceeding dealing with particular facts, but where a legislation -- a legislature is dealing with the broad facts upon which to establish broad legislative policy, it's much less necessary to go into the particular individual facts of -- of a -- of a particular case involving cross examination to test the answers and so on.</text>

            <text syncTime="2794.442" offset="11281115">It was not asserted that any one of those three were members of the Communist Party or were subversive persons.There was nothing in the record which indicated that they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.913" offset="11323016">Therefore, the questions he asked dealt with ordinary members of a political party and with their ordinary activities in political organization and consequently, where in an area that is denied to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.510" offset="11385396">Now, the Attorney General makes the same argument that these questions that -- well, he makes the argument that he had in his possession information that certain Communist Party members were active in the Progressive Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.668" offset="11442030">And therefore, he can ask as to whether so and so was active and later perhaps tied up with his knowledge about someone being in the Communist Party and therefore, find out whether there were Communists in Progressive Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.163" offset="11491976">But on that theory, if the Court please, the Attorney General could call anyone before him, ask a State that he had in his possession that there were some members of the Republican Party or the Democratic Party or the Americans for Democratic Action or any organization who are members of the Communist Party and then say, “How about so and so?</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.723" offset="11598242">What did he do in this organization?</text>

            <text syncTime="3232.712" offset="13034245">Now, I just want to say a final word about my last point, the -- the preemption point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.010" offset="13067368">There are two aspects to this without going into this again in any detail.Our position is that the validity of the resolution of investigation depends upon the validity of the 1951 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.993" offset="13139362">I won't develop the argument for that is in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.006" offset="13155349">I would simply say that I think both the New Hampshire Supreme Court and the Attorney General agree that the -- the statute authorizing the investigation is based upon, predicated upon and depends upon the validity of the 1951 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.069" offset="13219610">Therefore, the first question under this aspect to the argument is whether or not those provisions with respect to sedition in the 1951 Act under which the investigation was conducted are valid under the doctrine of Pennsylvania against Nelson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.355" offset="13304769">Now, on that, there is no distinction on Pennsylvania against Nelson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.658" offset="13318040">The -- the provisions were relatively the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.015" offset="13335385">They -- they dealt with the question of sedition involving the National Government, the Federal Government.All of the inquiry involved here related to questions of -- of sedition on a nationwide scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.609" offset="13401840">And consequently, those provisions of the Act of the New Hampshire statute which were involved, and the investigation conducted under them fall squarely within Pennsylvania against Nelson and no further extension of that doctrine is necessary here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.906" offset="13478954">I say further that even if the resolution does not depend upon the validity of the prior statute, it is invalid under Pennsylvania against Nelson because it is in aid of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.094" offset="13555754">Its only -- its -- its only sanction, its only power arises from the fact that it's in aid of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.656" offset="13581981">But this legislation under Pennsylvania against Nelson is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.886" offset="13598908">Therefore, the investigating resolution falls also.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.042" offset="13619493">If you say it has some purpose other than in aid of legislation, then it's a regulation and likewise falls within Pennsylvania against Nelson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.460" offset="13657213">Your Honor, I'd like to reserve such time as I had left to -- for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3405.385" offset="13724923">I feel that this case here is a very simple case, essentially.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.566" offset="13749687">We have a -- a situation which requires a good deal of clarification as to the facts, I think, before it's possible to realize just exactly what the issues are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.917" offset="13803081">I think that it's important to remember here that first of, the position of Mr. Sweezy before the Committee and I would like to refer to the Attorney General for the purpose of the investigation as a committee rather than as the Attorney General, so as to avoid possibility of misunderstanding as to the various aspects of separation of powers in view of the decision of the New Hamsphire Supreme Court referring constantly to the function of the Committee as a fact finding committee in the person, the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.181" offset="13944142">He was a witness before the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.821" offset="13954696">He was not a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.995" offset="13967339">The testimony which was taken in this case was taken in private sessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.066" offset="13987610">It was not taken in public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.749" offset="14002343">The position of Mr. Sweezy never became that of a defendant, until after in private session represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.486" offset="14053334">He had declined to answer questions not claiming his privilege against self-incrimination, and none under the practice which we have in New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.193" offset="14088129">It was necessary for the administrative official given the power to subpoena to transfer the matter to the Superior Court and to ask the Superior Court to go on with matter just as though it had been commenced initially in the Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.233" offset="14156257">That's the law in New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.231" offset="14168273">There's no such thing as a direct contempt of an administrative official without the insulation of a court hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.720" offset="14194291">And in this case, after the private sessions and with no publicity whatever, there was filed with the Superior Court a petition, asking for the Court's help.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.623" offset="14245909">And in the process of trying to find out whether or not these questions were relevant, the Superior Court in the State of New Hampshire spent two and a half days of argument in which two counsel, very confident counsel in our State were involved, before the court determined and ruled that the questions were relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.993" offset="14339323">And then, the Court went ahead and directed Mr. Sweezy to answer the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.555" offset="14365550">And Mr. Sweezy then continued to refuse to answer in Court, and the Court's finding then was that he was in contempt and he was released on bail and the case went up to the Supreme Court of New Hamsphire and is reported at page 210 of the transcript in this case in full.</text>

            <text syncTime="3636.801" offset="14650598">It was at a time when there was a good deal of confusion about this whole subject and there had been some abuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.894" offset="14678915">And before we went ahead, we drafted in New Hamsphire the rules of procedure which are set forth in our brief in this case at Page 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.830" offset="14726666">Those rules of procedure were adopted with the view to getting away from just such sort of difficulties that had happened in the past.</text>

            <text syncTime="3689.197" offset="14860204">Yes, sir, and the reason I referred to it is that a very excellent law review article quoted by appellant in his brief in 65 Yale L.J. makes a good deal of the point that the only application of the First Amendment to this type of situation that's meritorious can apply if a person is hauled into a public session and the matter is -- gone into -- to the extent of reaching an abuse of his privacy and his rights of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.383" offset="14968874">And I merely wanted to point out that in the rules of procedure which is applied in New Hampshire and which specifically applied to this case, there has been no such pushing of witnesses around.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.908" offset="15014954">I hope that before a decision is ultimately made in this case that both of the transcripts on the questioning of this witness which appear in full in the transcript and before the Court will be read to get the general sense of the situation that existed.</text>

            <text syncTime="4020.154" offset="16183986">And second, whether free speech generally speaking is abridged in the First Amendment sense by a legislative inquiry which is always subject to rules of pertinence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4035.115" offset="16243858">Mr. Emerson, Professor Emerson has made a lot here of so-called sanctions all through his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.857" offset="16274787">It is implicit that the sanctions of the legislative process of investigation are something which are a burden which a citizen does not and should not have to bear, because of the First Amendment, even though the questions which are asked of the witness are relevant and pertinent to a fact finding investigation in aid of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4066.733" offset="16370291">I am unable personally to quite see what those sanctions are or what they can be, particularly when one realizes that any abuse of method or any abuse of a witness is always subject to -- to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="4085.792" offset="16446568">And all such cases can readily be set aside in the event that legitimate private rights have been abused in the way which the Court abuses and violated of due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4101.819" offset="16510621">If the method is fair, if the questioning is courteous without any clink lights, if it's relevant and so found by a court, then I think there is no room if you're going to have intelligent legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4119.863" offset="16582823">There's no room to apply the First Amendment to prevent that type of question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.139" offset="16607901">In Rumely versus U.S. where they had a lobbying investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4131.987" offset="16631306">And in De Jong versus Oregon, with questions of membership in a party meeting as distinct from membership in a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="4141.791" offset="16670490">All in many of these cases where you have investigations not into subversive activities, it is well settled that the play of freedom of speech is much broader than it is in the field of subversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4156.669" offset="16730049">In Dennis versus U.S., the decision of this Court in an exhaustive sense brought so much to bear upon the application of the First Amendment to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4167.755" offset="16774353">And since that decision, there have been numerous decisions in the Circuit Courts and in the District Courts, which has specifically ruled on the question which is involved here now and which have found certiorari denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.354" offset="16832763">I refer particularly for example to U.S. versus Josephson which is cited in our brief and to which certiorari was denied in which the majority very explicitly dealt with the application of the First Amendment to questioning otherwise relevant in investigation by the House Committee on Un-American Activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4204.964" offset="16923251">As far as one thing and I've read a good many of the very cogent reasons which have been advanced by some members of this Court in these cases which deal with civil liberties, civil rights, private rights.One thing that I think is important to remember here is that this isn't a question of asking a man how he voted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.504" offset="17013426">This isn't the question of calling somebody a First Amendment Communist or calling somebody a Fifth Amendment Communist, or doing anything which is entirely inept and has resulted in a good deal of unfortunate confusion relating to this whole subject.</text>

            <text syncTime="5514.611" offset="22161847">We would not argue however that the quantitative question even if it were possible to answer it with precision is the crucial one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5520.783" offset="22186506">In the last analysis, those who hate violence must judge it by an entirely different standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="5525.993" offset="22207300">They must ask whether violence is used to perpetuate the state of affairs in which violence is inevitable or whether it is used in the interest of creating a truly human society from which it will be possible at long last to banish violence altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="5540.033" offset="22263515">So far as the United States and its allies are concerned, there is unfortunately no doubt about the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5545.559" offset="22285563">Our country is preparing to practice violence on a hitherto undreamed-of scale to preserve a social order which in the space of four decades has already produced the greatest orgy of violence in the whole long and violent history of the human race.</text>
            <text syncTime="5559.013" offset="22339375">Capitalism, the organization of society according to the barbaric principle of private profit, is the scourge of mankind.And violence designed to preserve it is doubly damned, once for itself and once for its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="5571.578" offset="22389635">Those of us who have socialism in our bones, will believe that a truly human society can be erected only on the basis of common ownership and economic planning, must necessarily judge the violence of the socialist countries differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="5586.434" offset="22449089">We hate it as we hate all violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5588.983" offset="22459329">We would have vastly preferred to have the building of the new economy take place peacefully and painlessly as it could have at the advance countries that led the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5598.636" offset="22497886">But history which as Frederick Engels once said is a most cruel goddess, decreed that the economic foundations of the society of the future must be laid in backward countries, not only without the assistance of the advanced countries but against their ruthless and implacable resistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5615.215" offset="22564237">It was thereby rendered inevitable that the process should be difficult, painful and violent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5620.347" offset="22584717">But the process does go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="5622.744" offset="22594330">Of that, the majestic successes of the Soviet economy despite all the strains and trials to which it has been subject within these years of hot and cold wars is irrefutable proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="5632.718" offset="22634245">And the hopes of mankind for a better future go with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5636.446" offset="22649187">For the first time in history, we can say that violence is being used to protect regimes which are doing their utmost to create a society which will be able to dispense with violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5648.212" offset="22696208">That makes all the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="5651.361" offset="22708851">”Well, when that -- when we had that in an investigation which in the last analysis is justifiable in relation to this aspect of First Amendment and freedom of speech issues, only because of this, the necessity of a State or the Federal Government to look into the question of whether there are people around seeking to overthrow the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5672.007" offset="22791398">I felt that it was necessary to question the witness concerning what terms he used and what he actually said.</text>
            <text syncTime="5679.964" offset="22823267">It is our State University.</text>
            <text syncTime="5682.226" offset="22832253">We do support it with tax money.</text>
            <text syncTime="5684.845" offset="22842702">We do feel that if we want to find burglar for example which you approved in this Court in Adler versus Board of Education, we might wish to make recommendations concerning legislation of that type in New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="5697.165" offset="22892022">I don't say that it's necessary at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5699.584" offset="22901739">I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="5700.828" offset="22906650">One can't know until at least the witness is directed to answer relevant questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5706.412" offset="22929011">As far as the witness was concerned, he simply declined to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5711.137" offset="22947924">He didn't claim the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5713.965" offset="22959208">And now, the position here apparently is that even if questions are relevant and on that point, the decision of the Highest Court in New Hampshire is that they were irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5724.571" offset="23001631">Even if they are relevant that there is some sort of a road block of the First Amendment which ought to be inserted to bar questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="5732.287" offset="23032560">As a practical matter, it's a little difficult to know just where one would draw the line, if there is to be a road block of that type.</text>
            <text syncTime="5740.091" offset="23063698">But assuming that a line could be drawn, then the question becomes hardly abuses, hardly invasions of freedom of speech in its absolute sense, as such a menace to the security and welfare of America that the First Amendment ought to be used in this type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5757.031" offset="23131512">We -- we submit that they are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5760.804" offset="23146559">We submit that the First Amendment does not apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5764.634" offset="23161919">We submit that the test must be its state legislatures or the Congress of the United States as to be intelligently informed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5772.658" offset="23193997">The test must be, one, that there must be a -- a law which is constitutional, a resolution which is tied to it which is clear and which reasonably informs as Mr. Justice Frankfurter has said, "The charter of the investigating committee, what its powers are."</text>
            <text syncTime="5791.822" offset="23270693">We then maintain that the questions asked under that charter must be relevant to the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5799.036" offset="23299532">As is said in U.S. versus Ullmann, what that means is directed to a -- in a possible answer, a possible answer which would have to do with the main object of the investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="6249.774" offset="25102503">There has been some mention of the fact that as interpreted by the Supreme Court of New Hampshire, the definition of subversive person includes a person who is a member of an organization that actually is subversive, although innocently so, not knowing it could be such.</text>
            <text syncTime="6265.446" offset="25165197">I'd like to point out first that there are no criminal sanctions attached to innocent membership and that the principle case's decision is very clear to point that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="6277.407" offset="25212949">Second, that no element of loyalty oath is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6282.717" offset="25234265">In Wieman versus Updegraff, a very different situation apply where people were required to execute affidavits of non-membership in subversive organizations or organizations on the Attorney General's list, even though there was no requirement that they were knowingly members of those organizations and this Court struck that down.</text>
            <text syncTime="6303.236" offset="25316289">An examination of the record in that case indicates that they offered to execute an affidavit inserting the words "not knowingly a member," but that was refused by the local officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="6314.771" offset="25362474">In this case, I want to make the same statement to this Court if there should be any part of confusion on that issue, in this particular problem here that -- that the Attorney General of Maryland made to this Court in Gerende verus Board of Supervisors in which you approved this basic type of legislation in that respect on his assurance that he would advice appropriate state officials that they should accept the affidavits which insert the word "knowingly" before any such comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6340.474" offset="25465292">That certainly would apply in New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="6342.561" offset="25473651">But in Nelson versus Wyman in 99 N.H. 33 and in the principle case, we have no issue here of any loyalty oath.</text>

            <text syncTime="6350.844" offset="25506774">The only real issues here are whether the Steve Nelson decision eliminates from the States the rights to make it a crime basically to overthrow state government as distinct from the Federal Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="6834.800" offset="27442552">Appellant answered, “If Communism is defined as in the New Hampshire Act, no, otherwise I won't discuss it.”</text>

            <text syncTime="6854.402" offset="27521024">The -- the New Hampshire Supreme Court in its decision says, “After inquiries which related to opinion and beliefs and answers to hypothetical questions,” the court, meaning the lower court, ruled that these were not relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6870.740" offset="27586330">Other questions were being relevant and then they went ahead and discussed only the lecture questions and the Progressive Party questions which are included in my brief.On -- it was on that basis that I assume that the belief question had dropped out.</text>

            <text syncTime="6920.228" offset="27784234">The appellant in this case attempted to draw a line between those areas in which the State had an interest in legislating with respect to political expression, and those areas where the State must stay out.</text>
            <text syncTime="6940.644" offset="27865945">That is the line which seems to me extremely important for this Court to recognize and -- and confirm so far as it can be made clear because the -- the whole development of political expression in times like this depends upon that kind of distinction and not apart and -- and the danger of blurring over that distinction.</text>
