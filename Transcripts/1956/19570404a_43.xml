            <label>Mr. George W. Crockett, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="15.847" offset="166745">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.672" offset="174059">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.985" offset="183359">This case represents another facet of the problem faced by both lawyers and judges in determining when there has been a waiver of the Fifth Amendment privilege and when there has not been such a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.723" offset="242291">Perhaps a brief statement of the facts, notwithstanding they're not in dispute, will serve to set forth the setting in which the legal issue arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.142" offset="283982">The contempt citation arose out of a denaturalization trial in which it was alleged that the petitioner who was naturalized in Detroit in 1946 had been within the 10-year period prior to her naturalization, a member of the Communist Party, and that she had not disclosed such membership, and for that reason was guilty of having procured her citizenship either illegally or by fraud by wilful misrepresentation rather.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.811" offset="418565">The answer filed by the petitioner denied these charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.775" offset="438523">Now in the course of the trial, the Government called the petitioner to the witness stand and attempted to gain from her some admissions concerning her alleged membership in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.675" offset="494111">It is apparent I think from an examination of the transcript of that portion of examination that petitioner upon the advice of her counsel had decided to answer all questions that had to do with her activity prior to her naturalization in November 1946 under the theory that certainly any alleged incriminating facts would be outlawed, shall I say, by the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.224" offset="608319">But she had also decided not to answer any questions with respect to such alleged activities after November 1946 relying upon her privilege under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.197" offset="660146">So that in the course of her direct examination by the Government, she admitted that in her youth, she had been a member of the Young Communist League, but that she become dissociated with the Young Communist League in 1935, the early part of 1935 which of course would be more than 10 years before her petition for a naturalization which was not filed until I believe it was August 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.625" offset="765889">The Government also asked her questions that had to do with the post-1946 period and as to all of those questions, she relied upon the Fifth Amendment and the trial court sustained her reliance upon the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.459" offset="821164">But I should like at this point to point out one fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.564" offset="833599">There were several questions put to the Government in the course of this examination under the rule which were not in terms limited to the pre-1946 period and embraced both the pre-1946 as well as the post-1946 period.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.130" offset="899845">For example, petitioner was asked whether or not she was acquainted with certain former communist who has become professional informers.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.849" offset="930774">She was also asked if she knew what the Michigan School of Social Science is, a well-known Communist Party school.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.631" offset="961912">Now those questions were not limited in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.558" offset="973615">She answered with respect to each of those questions and it was after those answers had been given that she relied upon the Fifth Amendment and the trial court sustained her reliance upon the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.788" offset="1034533">The trial court in sustaining that reliance refer to this Court's opinion in Blau.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.042" offset="1059506">But if we will examine this Court's opinion in Blau, we will find that this Court was adhering to the rule laid down in the Arndstein case, a rule that heretofore has been deemed applicable to everyone except the accused in a criminal case in determining when there is and when there is not a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.241" offset="1144351">I shall come to a more complete discussion of the rule in the Arndstein case later.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.239" offset="1164309">But I simply want to emphasize that notwithstanding petitioner had answered some of the questions that related to both pre and post-1946, the trial court sustained her privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.611" offset="1217808">At the conclusion of the Government's case, the petitioner was called to the stand by her own counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.101" offset="1243826">Here again, it is apparent from the examination of the transcript that a conscious effort was being made to limit her examination to the pre-1946 period.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.809" offset="1286562">As a result, she testified that during this period, she was never a member of a Communist Party, that she was a member of the Young Communist League, but that she left that organization in January 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.728" offset="1338284">Now as frequently happens in some of these cases notwithstanding counsel is conscious of the time sequence, some of his questions seemed to ignore the time sequence, so that when he began to ask petitioner again concerning the truthfulness of the answers given in her petition for naturalization such as, “Would she take up arms in defense of this Government?</text>
            <text syncTime="331.635" offset="1429922">Does she belong to any organizations that teach and advocate the overthrow of a Government by force and violence?”</text>
            <text syncTime="337.467" offset="1453223">His questions were not limited in time and petitioner's answers to those questions were not limited in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.367" offset="1480808">For example, one question that comes to my mind was, “You answered that question in the negative in your petition and you say that was a truthful answer then?</text>
            <text syncTime="354.484" offset="1521351">Is it a truthful answer now?”</text>
            <text syncTime="356.493" offset="1529396">And the petitioner said, “Yes, that's a truthful answer now.”</text>
            <text syncTime="359.831" offset="1542666">So we have in these series of questions not only what amounts to a protestation of loyalty in the period prior to 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.872" offset="1586866">That protestation is carried over into the period post-1946 and it is because of this carrying over effect of the answers to these questions that the Court of Appeals came to the conclusion that that constituted a waiver of the Fifth Amendment privilege and it was on that basis that Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.190" offset="1668159">Now in the -- in the course of her cross-examination by the Government while she was on the stand voluntarily, the first question put to her was, “Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?”</text>
            <text syncTime="405.590" offset="1725733">She relied upon the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.970" offset="1735241">The trial court after argument stated its conclusion more or less in these words.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.289" offset="1764498">He stated that he believe that the same rule that is applied to the accused who voluntarily takes the stand in a criminal case should be applied to the defendant in a civil case who voluntarily takes the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.574" offset="1817684">And that therefore when you voluntarily take the stand as a defendant in a civil case, by that act, you waive the protection of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.305" offset="1860629">So petitioner was judged guilty of contempt and sentenced to a term of six months.</text>

            <text syncTime="451.565" offset="1909635">Do you think it's quite fair to say that the -- that the trial court held that the mere taking of the witness stand was the thing that waived the privilege or that plus the answers given to questions to follow?</text>

            <text syncTime="467.353" offset="1972746">The trial court, Your Honor, did not deal with the answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.917" offset="1987062">He stated specifically and I'm quoting now from the transcript page 38.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.450" offset="2005138">He stated that petitioner, “had waived the right to claim any privilege under the Fifth Amendment by reason of having testified as a witness in her own behalf.”</text>
            <text syncTime="485.984" offset="2047352">That's where he refers to the question of testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.741" offset="2058324">But at the time that he cited her for contempt, he put it on the basis of her having taken the stand.</text>

            <text syncTime="495.251" offset="2084342">And again in his certificate, I think he uses the term, “she haven't taken the stand.”</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="500.478" stopTime="508.432">
            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="500.478" offset="2105240">Well implicit in that statement may have it not be said that it means that plus what she did after taking the stand.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_w_crockett_jr" startTime="508.432" stopTime="509.517">
            <label>Mr. George W. Crockett, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="508.432" offset="2137109">I would disagree.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="509.517" stopTime="510.047">
            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="509.517" offset="2141393">Why?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_w_crockett_jr" startTime="510.047" stopTime="569.893">
            <label>Mr. George W. Crockett, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="510.047" offset="2143587">I can see how, Your Honor, might possibly reach that conclusion but where he repeats over and over in the course not only of his first adjudication of contempt but also in his certificate that by reason of taking the stand, you waive and where he draws the analogy to the accused in a criminal case, I think the inference is a compelling one that his ruling is based upon her taking the stand and not upon her having answered any questions as far as she was on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.919" offset="2255078">Now I want to deal with the validity of the trial court's ruling against the rule which we submit the trial court was required to apply in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.245" offset="2296351">The rule as laid down by this Court in the Arndstein case and there were two Arndstein cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.825" offset="2322683">The first Arndstein case was an appeal from a denial of a writ of habeas corpus in a bankruptcy proceeding where the accused had filed schedules and then in the course of his examination concerning those schedules, he claimed the protection of a Fifth Amendment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harold_burton" startTime="569.893" stopTime="571.641">
            <label>Justice Harold Burton</label>
            <text syncTime="569.893" offset="2382973">Is that the 262 case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_w_crockett_jr" startTime="571.641" stopTime="1120.688">
            <label>Mr. George W. Crockett, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="571.641" offset="2389974">That's the opinion as reported in 254 U.S. at page 71.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.469" offset="2417246">In there, this Court rested its -- its decision squarely upon its holding that the schedules contained and I quote, “No admissions of guilt are furnished clear proof of crime.”</text>
            <text syncTime="592.290" offset="2472521">Now, we need not go into a consideration of what is meant by clear proof of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.043" offset="2503555">I submit that there, the Court was really saying unless there has been a prima facie case of crime established by virtue of the answers given by the witness to the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.527" offset="2545455">Certainly with respect to this proceeding, there is nowhere here any admission of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.277" offset="2572518">There is nowhere here any clear proof of crime based upon the answers given by the petitioner to the questions concerning her loyalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.693" offset="2610134">Now also in the Arndstein case following the Court's setting forth of this rule, there was a petition for reargument and this Court's opinion there as recorded at 254 U.S. at page 379.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.477" offset="2669275">In that reargument, the Government urged a reconsideration of that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.214" offset="2688188">This Court however said and I quote, “Our conclusion concerning the constitutional question presented, we think is so plainly correct that a reargument would be unprofitable.”</text>
            <text syncTime="657.918" offset="2735000">The petition for reargument is denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.198" offset="2748165">In following that, the lower court issued the writ and discharged Arndstein.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.239" offset="2772302">And the Government then took an appeal from that order of the lower court and that is the opinion of this Court that is recorded at 262 U.S. at page 355.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.805" offset="2818591">Now, on that appeal, the Government contends, and the contention is very similar to the contention that they make here.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.586" offset="2845759">They said that Arndstein had waived his privilege because and I quote, “He had before refusing to answer the questions in issue testified of his own accord without invoking any privilege to the very matter with which these questions were concerned.”</text>
            <text syncTime="705.400" offset="2924962">And the District Court in its opinion refers to Arndstein's testimony as constituting denials and partial disclosures.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.660" offset="2957981">This Court however adhered to its rule set forth in the first opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.050" offset="2983581">And it again held that there was no waiver unless and until there had been an admission of guilt or furnished clear proof of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.905" offset="3031019">Now what is significant is that in reaching that decision, the Court relies very heavily upon two cases, one was a New York case, Foster against the People and the other was a -- rather Michigan case, Foster against People and the other was a New York case, People against Forbes.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.011" offset="3103431">And this is what this Court's said about Foster versus People.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.147" offset="3119940">In Foster versus People, 18 Michigan, 266, the Court while holding that a witness who has voluntarily admitted his guilt of a criminal offense is not protected from further disclosures on the same subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.354" offset="3176782">He said that if he has not actually admitted criminating facts, he may unquestionably stop short at any point and determine that he will go no further in that direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.155" offset="3231953">Now, much has been made in the Government's brief about drawing a distinction between a witness who is voluntarily on the stand and one who is testifying involuntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.099" offset="3279809">I gather from their brief that they do not challenge the application of the Arndstein rule to a witness who is testifying involuntarily, but they said should not be applied -- pardon me -- where the witness voluntarily takes the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.875" offset="3338846">Significantly however in Foster versus People, the very case that this Court relied on in establishing the rule in Arndstein, the witness there had voluntarily taken the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.919" offset="3383045">He was an accomplice.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.986" offset="3387329">He'd given a statement to the prosecution and the prosecution had called him as a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.321" offset="3408645">The Court, certainly in effect is saying but for the fact that in the course of your testimony you have already incriminated yourself by admitting your participation in this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.307" offset="3448560">You would have been able to stop short, but since you have admitted your guilt or furnished clear proof of crime, you must go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.344" offset="3484714">I cite that only to emphasize that not only was the rule not limited in Foster versus People, to cases where the witness took the stand involuntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.306" offset="3528600">But this Court did not so limit it even in the Arndstein case.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.755" offset="3546363">Now this Court also referred as I mentioned before to the New York case of People versus Forbes which is very interesting because there, the witness and I shall quote what the Court said, what this Court said rather in summarizing that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.063" offset="3607594">In People versus Forbes, 143 New York 219, 38 N.E. 303, it was held that a witness, by answering questions exonerating himself in general terms from all connection with a criminal transaction does not thereby waive his right to remain silent when it is thereafter sought to draw from him, circumstances, which might form another link in the chain of facts capable of being used to his peril.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.545" offset="3725563">In the Forbes case, the defendant -- the witness rather had taken the stand and he had denied any connection with the crime which had to do with I think it was homicide that resulted from some chemical experiments or pranks on the part of students.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.402" offset="3792959">But he had also testified that he was a student in the chemistry class with one of the other suspects and that he had a knowledge of the gas that was being used and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.468" offset="3837262">It was following those admissions that he relied upon the privilege and his reliance upon the privilege was sustained by the New York Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.360" offset="3876864">Now finally, getting back again to the Arndstein case.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.064" offset="3891597">In summarizing the basis for its holding, this Court said, in short, it is apparent not only from the language of the former opinion but from its citations that this Court applied to the non-incriminating schedules the rule in the cases cited namely that where the previous disclosure by an ordinary witness is not an actual admission of guilt on criminating facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.092" offset="3999744">He is not deprived of the privilege of stopping short in his testimony whenever he may fairly tend to incriminate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.437" offset="4029106">And although there is some conflict of authority as to the application of this rule, we see no reason for departing from its recognition in the former opinion and think that it is a sound rule which should be applied to the involuntary examination of a bankrupt where he is practically in the position of a witness under cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.261" offset="4120430">And since we find that none of the answers which had been voluntarily given by Arndstein, either by way of denials or partial disclosures, amounted to an admission or showing of guilt, we are of opinion that he was entitled to decline to answer further questions when so to do might tend to incriminate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.165" offset="4204022">But notwithstanding the Court's opinion, the Government was not satisfied and petitioned this Court for a fourth rehearing and reargument in the Arndstein case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.376" offset="4248848">And that is recorded at 266 U.S. at page 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.478" offset="4269328">And in this petition, the Government argued that the privilege, Fifth Amendment privilege, should not extend to the examination of a bankrupt made for the purpose of obtaining possession of his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.209" offset="4312168">And what's more, the Government also argued that the privilege and I quote, “does not apply in any civil proceeding.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.976" offset="4347277">And this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Brandeis said the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.653" offset="4365981">The contrary must be accepted as settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.106" offset="4379773">The privilege is not ordinarily dependent upon the nature of the proceeding in which the testimony is sought or is to be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.059" offset="4411643">It applies a right to civil and criminal proceedings wherever the answer might tend to subject to criminal responsibility, him who gives it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.398" offset="4448946">The privilege protects the male witness as fully as it does one who is also a party defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.538" offset="4481546">And so in conclusion with respect to the trial court's ruling in this case, it would appear that the trial court correctly followed the ruling of this Court while the witness was on the stand as an involuntary witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.638" offset="4537971">But for some reason, he seems to have concluded that the rule in Arndstein did not apply where the witness took the stand as shall we say a voluntary witness.</text>

            <text syncTime="1127.365" offset="4612786">The trial court therefore by implication is limiting this Court's rule in Arndstein to those cases where a party voluntarily takes the stand in its holding -- or rather I misspoke myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.247" offset="4668374">A trial court is limiting Arndstein to those -- those cases in which a party who voluntarily takes the stand in a civil proceeding and saying that in that case, Arndstein does not apply, but that where the party is called to the stand against his or her will, Arndstein does apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.065" offset="4747682">Now let's examine that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.029" offset="4755519">In the first place, my examination has failed to uncover and the Government has not suggested in any of its briefs, any such limitation of the Arndstein rule made by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.067" offset="4811630">And I would suggest that the absence of any such holding is itself a potent reason for concluding that such is not the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.635" offset="4841932">But I agree that we should have perhaps a little more compelling reasons than just the absence of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.720" offset="4866278">What then is meant by compulsion within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment?</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.319" offset="4884668">Is the Fifth Amendment addressed to all compulsion or is it addressed to compulsion to testify to incriminating matter?</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.903" offset="4918941">I suggest that it means the latter and that therefore compulsion to testify means compulsion to testify to incriminating matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.633" offset="4957915">And this compulsion can arise only where there is a direction to give evidence that is claimed to be incriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.593" offset="4997726">But you cannot decide whether or not a particular question or a particular bit of evidence is incriminatory until after the witness has been sworn and has taken the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.041" offset="5047568">It is familial law that you cannot claim the protection of the Fifth Amendment before you were sworn and you cannot claim the protection of the Fifth Amendment until you have acquainted the Court either by argument or by prior testimony with the setting, which makes possible the validity of your claim of the Fifth Amendment and this cannot happen until after the witness takes the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.840" offset="5138683">I suggest further that if we follow the Government's theory, it would excuse all witnesses from coming in voluntarily to testify upon the simple claim that any testimony they would give might tend to incriminate them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.208" offset="5200227">And we would be relegated to the proposition where every witness would have to be subpoenaed to come into Court in order to get the protection of the Fifth Amendment with respect to that portion of his testimony which might be deemed incriminating.</text>

            <text syncTime="1357.840" offset="5534699">The defendant did not testify fully and freely the whole gamut of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.389" offset="5552880">The defendant limited her testimony on the issue of Communist Party membership to the period prior to 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.139" offset="5583914">She did not testify with respect to those issues as they presented themselves in the period after 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.395" offset="5612962">And with respect to the period prior to 1946, she answered all of the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.300" offset="5632606">It is only in that area where she gave general answers protesting her loyalty that the Court of Appeals spells out a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.505" offset="5677432">Now the Court of Appeals when we come to its decision predicates its claim of a waiver upon an application of this Court's opinion in the Raffel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.327" offset="5720691">The Raffel case was discussed in the previous argument and I need not summarize its facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.180" offset="5744097">But I believe the Court of Appeals committed error in holding that the test which this Court says applies to the accused in a criminal case is to be carried over and applied to a defendant in a civil case because first, this Court has said that the waiver of the Fifth Amendment privilege is not likely to be inferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.868" offset="5834794">It must be predicated upon a conscious election that is plainly inconsistent with the claim of a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.554" offset="5861543">Now, let's compare the status of the accused in a criminal case with that of the defendant in a civil case and see if there is there any justification for carrying the rule applicable to the accused over to the defendant on a civil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.593" offset="5921729">In the first place, in the criminal case, the accused not only has a privilege against incriminating himself, he has a privilege against being called to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.617" offset="5965824">The defendant in a civil case has no such privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.451" offset="5981184">When the accused therefore voluntarily takes the stand, he is consciously casting aside his privilege against being compelled to give incriminating testimony and he knows when he takes the stand that the primary object of the cross-examination is to incriminate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.644" offset="6057984">The party defendant in a civil case has no such notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.680" offset="6074075">He has no such knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.251" offset="6080345">He has no basis for any such anticipation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.554" offset="6093615">So there is, applying the general principles that they normally apply where we are spelling out a waiver as a matter of fact, there is a basis for saying that there is a waiver of the accused who voluntarily takes the stand, whereas there is no basis for saying that there is a conscious election or waiver on the part of a party defendant who takes the stand in a civil case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1613.711" offset="6558177">I think in each instance, the question is whether or not there has been an admission of guilt or the furnishing of clear proof of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.452" offset="6589210">I would say for example in Rogers that there was no admission of guilt because there was quite a bit more that the Government would have to be -- have to prove granted the fact that -- that Mrs. Rogers testified to before it could sustain a conviction under the Smith Act for example but take this case, we would have to know specifically what it is she is admitting to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.604" offset="6669772">So that if for example she admitted not only that she was a member of a Communist Party in the post-1946 period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.021" offset="6703417">But, and this is very important that she knew the Communist Party to be an organization that taught and advocated the overthrow of the Government by force and violence, which she has already denied here and which was not even admitted in Rogers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.726" offset="6754304">And that she had the specific intents to overthrow the Government of the United States while she was a member, which this Court has said is an ingredient of any criminal prosecution under the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.553" offset="6797563">If she admitted all of that, then I would say clearly there has been a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.069" offset="6815640">Now the next question is where can she go short of that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.741" offset="6830373">The answer to that is that I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.176" offset="6836120">This Court has said in the Blau case that she could admit membership in the Communist Party and that would not be a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.597" offset="6861720">But in the Rogers case, it went on to say, if she admitted membership, officership, and discuss freely her activities, that is a waiver.</text>

            <text syncTime="1919.051" offset="7779558">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.678" offset="7810069">The Court of Appeals made clear and I'm just referring at the moment to record 46, made clear in its opinion that it was not holding that the mere fact of taking the witness stand by the civil defendant who volunteered in this case was a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.369" offset="7920828">Thus it stated here, she testified at length in her own defense and our conclusions are based upon that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.146" offset="7971924">I think we have in this case a situation, which is unlike that which has ever come before this Court before in connection with the matter of waiver of privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.744" offset="8038379">I think there have been two classic types of cases, which should come to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.872" offset="8066905">The first and most numerous class involves the witness who is required as by force of subpoena to come in and to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.683" offset="8126151">The witness may be one who appeared before a congressional committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.661" offset="8146004">He may be one who is summoned before a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.574" offset="8161677">He may have been summoned before a commissioner in bankruptcy as in Arndstein against McCarthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.395" offset="8184978">He may have been a witness compelled to testify before an administrative tribunal or a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.455" offset="8209220">Now in all of those situations, the rule would seem clearly to be that the witness does not waive privilege, cannot indeed waive privilege at least until the point is reached where he is asked a question, which he had an option of answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.462" offset="8309217">The compelled witness by definition has to answer every question, which is not privileged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.141" offset="8331891">I'm assuming that the questions are within the competence of the inquisitorial body to ask.Consequently there could be no basis for an inference of waiver until the point was reached that the witness chose to answer questions, which he might have refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.534" offset="8413497">Now of course when they get difficult questions as to when that point is reached when you can say that the witness made a clear choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.998" offset="8455398">But my point here is that this case does not fall into that category at all because if we are correct in our reading of the facts and they were so interpreted by the Courts below, this is not a case of a witness who in any sense was under compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.010" offset="8523421">This is a case of a witness who elected, who volunteered to persuade the trier of the fact on a particular issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.841" offset="8590712">As I said, there's a second class of cases which has come before this Court and that class of course represented by cases like Raffel and Caminetti, involved the criminally accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.047" offset="8643584">The rule there has generally been stated that the criminally accused if he elects to take the stand waives as to any and every fact that's an issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.048" offset="8703561">The theory of that I think is that the criminally accused knows that as soon as he gets on the stand of necessity, he is going to have to talk about incriminating matters because nothing else is relevant in his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.383" offset="8760926">Consequently, there's a basis for applying a broad rule of waiver and holding him to the necessity of talking about all of the interconnected facts, which go to the ultimate question of guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.484" offset="8825292">Now, we are not urging here and I do not think the Court of Appeals held here that the rule, which has been ordinarily applied to the criminally accused must be automatically applied to the civil defendant who elects to take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.207" offset="8912227">I think there may well be a difference, one can certainly conceive of cases in which a civil defendant might be taken completely by surprise by questions posed on cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.728" offset="8978265">And it's certainly unnecessary in this case to go so far as to say that the civil defendant merely by taking the stand waives as to everything in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.197" offset="9024136">I think what the Court of Appeals in substance held here was, that a party to a civil case could not voluntarily take the stand, offer herself as a witness in her own course, undertake to persuade the trier of the facts of her side of the story and then claim privilege as to the very matters, the very subject matter, which she opened up on her own direct examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.249" offset="9148374">Now, that brings me to the question, what did she open up under direct examination in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.971" offset="9175228">What was the sequence of events which transpired before the District Court held that Mrs. Brown was in contempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="2368.881" offset="9578872">I -- I was suggesting even if the rule were narrower there'd be no problem in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.083" offset="9595695">And this is what I have in mind, let us suppose for a moment that Mrs. Brown testified as she did when she was the Government witness and she testified as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.436" offset="9637073">She answered all questions which related to pre-1946 and then as to questions which were either unlimited as to time or post-1946 she claimed privilege.</text>

            <text syncTime="2540.960" offset="10267251">But what I was -- the point I was attempting to make, if Your Honor please, and I think this is -- is actually important because waiver is a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.463" offset="10309256">Her privilege was sustained so long as she was a compelled witness called under the federal rules of civil procedure as an adverse party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.736" offset="10354291">During that testimony as a government witness, she refused and the Court sustained privilege without any reservation or hesitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.512" offset="10385429">She refused to testify as to any post-1946 act or affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.174" offset="10408103">Now there is no contention to those questions as to post-1946 weren't relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.382" offset="10428897">Petitioner concedes that they were and that it's relevant to show it's probative if one can show it to prove that one was a Communist Party member in 1946, to show that she was a member in 1947, 1948, 1949 and 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.378" offset="10504861">So far then, her privilege is fully sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.267" offset="10520430">At the end of the Government's case, defense counsel announces I am now putting petitioner on the stand as a witness for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.676" offset="10562121">And I'd say at that point, defense counsel proceeded to ask her questions which were unlimited as to time which related specifically to period after 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.188" offset="10616142">Questions which can only be read as showing a calculated effort to convince the Court, the trier of the fact, that Mrs. Brown at all times, both before and after naturalization had been attached to the principles of the constitution and that she had never at anytime been a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.085" offset="10711751">Now those questions are set forth in the Court of Appeals' opinion at page 43, their quote from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.676" offset="10754069">And there is a whole series of questions there occupying most of that page in which defense counsel repeatedly asks what does the witness believed today, have you ever, are you ever, or were you ever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.113" offset="10815822">In other words, there are questions which clearly cover the entire span, both her acts before and after naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.467" offset="10861275">I won't read everyone of them but Your Honors will see that they are all unlimited as to time and that the only purpose of this testimny could have been convinced the Court that at no time had Mrs. Brown been associated with the organizations which she was alleged to have been associated with when she filed her naturalization application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.054" offset="10975587">One of the questions, “To your knowledge, did you ever belong to any organization that taught or advocated anarchy or the overthrow of the existing government?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.770" offset="11014457">Now, we say under any rule, a party witness who opens up a particular subject in issuing the case and tries to persuade the Court, the trier of the facts as to his version must necessarily be taken to have assumed the concomitant burden of asking -- of answering questions posed on cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.010" offset="11135457">And it did essentially that that we view the Court of Appeals as having held matters of rule which we take it to have applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.637" offset="11181955">Now actually getting back to a question which Mr. Justice Brennan asked a short time ago about what the cases hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.227" offset="11220302">There had been few federal cases in the appellate courts where the question of waiver of privilege by a party volunteer in a civil case has arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.473" offset="11281220">One can perhaps surmise that most civil defendants expect to be cross-examined or if they balk and they are told that they have to submit to cross-examination because they volunteered and they opened themselves up that they then comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.780" offset="11358542">There are two District Court cases which we have cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.769" offset="11374425">We've also cited three state court cases and I -- I might allude briefly to one or two of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.694" offset="11418102">In United States against Brooks, which was a District Court case in Michigan, we have a situation not too dissimilar from the one here and that that was a deportation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.819" offset="11482676">And one of the contentions there was that an admission of a conviction of bigamy was made by the deportee over objections which were erroneously overruled by the naturalization examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.224" offset="11552266">And the District Court stated in discussing that point, it appears from the record that petitioner consented to be sworn and to testify in his own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.238" offset="11600332">He does waive any constitutional right to refuse to answer even criminating questions so long as they were germane to the subject matter of the inquiry.</text>
