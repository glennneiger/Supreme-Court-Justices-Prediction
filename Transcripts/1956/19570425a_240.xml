            <text syncTime="11.802" offset="150549">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors, when Court recessed on yesterday, I was making the prime point of the respondent in this case that the jury in its verdict on specific issues found that respondent was not guilty of any negligence and that these specific issues control and delimited the one general issue answered in favor of petitioner on failure to furnish a reasonable safe place to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.984" offset="395264">Now, with the Courts permission, I would like to refer to page 13 of petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.993" offset="455346">On that page and in the second grammatical paragraph, petitioner seeks to set out the points upon which he relies for an unreasonable place to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.869" offset="546879">I would like to take those points up, one by one, and show how the jury has found on specific issues against petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.500" offset="617409">The paragraph begins this way, "With reference to respondent's duty to furnish petitioner, a reasonably safe place to work, the evidence showed that petitioner was struck by a truck which was backing up.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.700" offset="694209">I'll write in that connection, let us refer to the jury's answer, this special issue number 17 shown in the record at page 315 wherein the jury found that it was not negligence for the truck to back up and that is the first point that he makes.</text>

            <text syncTime="208.523" offset="937462">And that the jury found that that was not negligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="217.391" offset="972988">He says that with reference to respondent's -- respondent's duty to furnish petitioner a reasonably safe place to work, the evidence showed that petitioner was struck by a truck which was backing up on a 10 foot 8 inch gravel driveway running adjacent to respondent's railroad trucks on which were situated three cars.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.106" offset="1187819">The Court brings in next the question of the 10 foot 8 inch gravel driveway.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.501" offset="1213419">In that connection, I would refer the Chief Justice to special issues number 7 and 8 appearing at page 12 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.325" offset="1260648">Now, special issue number 7 asked on the occasion in question and on an area in question, did the respondent permit a truck to be driven, the jury says, “Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="311.337" offset="1348733">Now, bear in mind, if the Chief Justice please, that is on a particular area on the question on the occasion in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.190" offset="1396172">And answer to special issue number 8, which is a corollary issue to special issue number 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.212" offset="1428250">The question is this, do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that such act in permitting such use, if any on the part of the defendant, Panhandle and Santa Fe Railway Company, was negligence?</text>
            <text syncTime="345.443" offset="1485093">The jury's answer is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.279" offset="1508498">Who take the position that that is specific with regard to the area, the 10 foot 8 inch driveway?</text>

            <text syncTime="374.100" offset="1599822">But why -- why would not this whole verdict sum up to something like this, that no, it wasn't negligent to have the truck on the driveway.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.336" offset="1652694">No, the operation of the truck in backing up was not negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.522" offset="1681429">No, it wasn't negligent not to have a lookout, to warn the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.336" offset="1708701">But, to have the truck on a narrow driveway and order the petitioner to work in that circumstance was to provide the petitioner with an unsafe place to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.631" offset="1777873">Why isn't that exactly what the jury held?</text>

            <text syncTime="426.481" offset="1809324">There is nothing in the record to indicate that there was anything else other than these specifics, the very pleading of the plaintiff, the petitioner and the trial court points out these specifics.</text>

            <text syncTime="446.208" offset="1888214">Well, this was a -- this -- this certainly was in the evidence, if I read it correctly, that this was a narrow 10 foot 8 inch driveway, that there was a truck on it, unloading nail or loading nail as the case maybe from the car, that this petitioner was ordered to work and required to work where he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.759" offset="1982360">I think there was some testimony that well he could've worked elsewhere if he wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.657" offset="1998033">But the fact is this was part of the work that he was assigned to do, whatever it was in relation to those railroad cars, isn't that right?</text>

            <text syncTime="1194.511" offset="4881429">A driveway too narrow for the occupancy of the workman and the truck at the same time and the workman's last act was to reach under the car as far as he could with a claw hammer and turn a valve in order to convert the cars from -- pass new service to freight service as there were going out that night by freight and turned his back to the truck and walked away and was hit by the truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.707" offset="5010160">So, the whole position is here, that the Amarillo Court invaded the province of the jury when it took away that verdict on its own facts, because there is ample evidence, as Mr. Justice Brennan has pointed out to support that one issue of unsafe place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.039" offset="5091558">The respondent has briefed this case and argued this case on state law, state rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.834" offset="5126666">He cites the special issue law and his appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.120" offset="5139832">But that's narrowing the field which the Federal Government has given all railroad employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.186" offset="5164074">And to this, to us, this case is more important than just to the litigants here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.430" offset="5193122">Do the railroad employees of Texas are the railroad employees' of Texas entitled to the same benefits under the act as other states or should we go across the line in Oklahoma where they do not have special issue law to get the benefits of this liberal act that this Court has so many times held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.732" offset="5282252">Counsel was just now arguing assumed risk because he selected that time himself, that's out of the Federal Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.426" offset="5329063">We think the Amarillo Court should be reversed and the trial court reinstated under all of the facts in this case.</text>
