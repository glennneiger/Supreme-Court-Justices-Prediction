            <label>Mr. Osmond K. Fraenkel</label>
            <text syncTime="11.254" offset="150403">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.425" offset="159075">This, also, is a nationality case.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.271" offset="174540">It comes here in an action for a declaratory judgment, instituted by the petitioner here after he had been denied a passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.875" offset="232950">The basis for the denial of the passport was that, in 1944, when he was serving with the armed forces in Casablanca, he had been convicted by court martial of desertion and dishonorably discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.007" offset="309436">And therefore, came within subsection (g) of the Nationality Act of 1940 which provides for loss of nationality under such circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.783" offset="364502">In the action, motions for summary judgment were made by both parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.171" offset="398148">The plaintiff, submitting an affidavit to which was a next state summary of the court martial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.547" offset="435660">In that affidavit, he stated that he was -- had been then 20 years old, that he had been confined in Casablanca by reason of some breaches of military discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.127" offset="485919">That finding, the conditions of his confinement as he says intolerable, he had escaped from confinement, had never left the area controlled by American troops.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.071" offset="533671">And on the day following his escape, had surrendered himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.236" offset="562406">And the excerpt from the court martial proceedings consists of the testimony of the officer to whom he surrendered himself and a Sergeant who accompanied that officer, which stated that petitioner at the time was walking along the road from a place called Meknes which is variously spelled Moknes to Rabat.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.685" offset="668150">And as the Atlas indicates, that's going back toward Casablanca, instead of away toward the Spanish-Moroccan border.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.082" offset="705766">Petitioner stated at the court martial that he had escaped because of his intolerable conditions and because he had some notion that he might be able to rejoin his own battalion, which have been sent to Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.842" offset="764803">In his affidavit, he states that he had no intention to contact the enemy.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.880" offset="784969">That he had made no attempt to contact the enemy.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.753" offset="796463">That he had no connection with any foreign state of any kind, whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.976" offset="829273">The judge in the District Court agreed with the parties that there were no issues of fact, no disputed issues of fact, and therefore, that the case was right for decision on summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.355" offset="886847">In two brief memoranda, which deal with none of the legal questions presented to him, the judge granted the defendant's motion and denied the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.262" offset="938465">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, and Judge Clark dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.479" offset="963333">The majority in the Court rejected a contention, which I had made on behalf of petitioner that the statute should be construed, to be applicable only to those who desert to the enemy.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.350" offset="1026863">The Court, feeling that there was no sufficient doubt about the constitutionality of the statute to justify such an interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.897" offset="1061031">The Court did not specifically discuss the constitutional questions, other than to recite this Court's decisions in Mackenzie and Savorgnan in repudiation of the notion, which I had advanced to that Court and do not advance here, that nationality cannot be lost absent -- a desire to loose it.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.242" offset="1162386">That is not my position.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.295" offset="1170641">My position is that Congress has no power to destroy the nationality of a native-born American, except, one, to consent to a voluntary abjuration of such nationality or accession of other nationality, and two, to regulate dual nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.379" offset="1298954">My position, being that Congress has no power, either under the broad provisions of the constitution as a sovereign or under the limitations of the constitution found both in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment in the Eighth Amendment, to decree loss of nationality to -- to a native-born citizen because of some act permitted by that citizen, which the Congress may think inimicable, inimical to the interest of the United States where that Act has no relation whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.267" offset="1454540">As I submit in the case at bar, the Act has no such relation to the acquisition of nationality elsewhere or to any manifestation of allegiance to another country, that loss of nationality may not be an instrument of domestic policy, but is an instrument of international policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.579" offset="1575748">Now, perhaps the breadth of my position maybe illustrated if I attempt a brief spectrum of the various provisions of law, which permit or decree loss of nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.573" offset="1675745">Starting at the clearest point, you have subsections (f) and (i) of the 1940 Act, which provide for loss of nationality where a citizen has abjured, either in this country or elsewhere under certain form.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.816" offset="1764665">And then, you have the case under subsection (a), where the citizen has formally upheld the nationality of another country.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.759" offset="1816492">And then, you have the provision which we discussed yesterday, which is no longer in the law, a provision of the 1907 Act, construed in the Mackenzie case where nationality was lost at least temporarily because of marriage to a foreigner, the woman in that case acquiring an additional nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.143" offset="1925998">I might suggest parenthetically that I think Mackenzie was wrongly decided insofar as it permitted loss of nationality to a person who had not left the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.914" offset="1993080">I can concede that if a married woman, acquiring nationality elsewhere, those -- the country of that acquired nationality, considerations of possible international embarrassment might arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.673" offset="2060163">But I cannot conceive how they could arise so long as you remained in this country, and therefore, to that extent, I would say that Mackenzie had been wrongly decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.752" offset="2092450">But of course, I didn't go that far in my case.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.634" offset="2111990">And then, we come to those cases where an oath of allegiance has been taken, although, no formal acquisition of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.935" offset="2149188">And there, I think we enter -- or rather we leave the area of the first category, permissible to Congress, declaration of loss of a nationality here where a nationality elsewhere has been acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.187" offset="2234138">And we enter the more debatable area of the regulation of dual nationality, which may arise in connection with voting in a foreign election, holding public office, serving in foreign armies or various things of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.175" offset="2302161">And there, I recognized that the Government has power to act, but I believe as counsel in the earlier cases before this Court indicated, that Congress has no power to create a conclusive presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.466" offset="2371333">It could lay down certain conditions under which these acts might constitute loss of nationality, giving an opportunity -- where those conditions indicate a choice of allegiance.However, again, I need not go that far here.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.695" offset="2464225">Somewhere along this middle area is the case which might arise, where the statute which I am concerned with construed as I had suggested below and as I also suggest here as limited to desertion to the enemy.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.499" offset="2531412">Because there, although, there would be no acquisition, perhaps, of a new nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.491" offset="2555340">The act of desertion to the enemy may be so unequivocal as treason would be, so unequivocal, a -- an informal abjuration of allegiance to this country as to justify congressional declaration on the subject.</text>

            <text syncTime="682.224" offset="2834328">At -- to take the first case that I mentioned, a formal abjuration of United States citizenship may not result in acquisition of citizenship elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.606" offset="2879885">And under those particular circumstances might result as the voluntary act, deliberate voluntary act of the former American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.259" offset="2914471">And I consider treason to be of that character, and I think desertion to the enemy of that character, because while there no citizenship has been acquired elsewhere, the act is of such a character that it can properly be described as abjuration of allegiance.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.183" offset="3006109">But I say a desertion which in this case is not even the normal desertion of an intent to avoid military service, that the desertion technically defined by the articles of war, namely, absence from a post of duty to avoid unpleasant service and I suppose, escape from confinement comes within that description.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.760" offset="3112479">It is an unpleasant service to be confined.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.750" offset="3128466">And in any event, the court martial so found, but it has relation, no conceivable relation to allegiance to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.160" offset="3166083">It's an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.805" offset="3168590">Of course, it's an offense, and it's an offense for which a person deserves to be punished and this man was sentenced to serve at hard labor for a period of years and he served that sentence, so that I come now to that area such as this, to this kind of desertion which has no connection with any foreign country of any sort whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.378" offset="3254899">The statute doesn't even require that desertion occur outside the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.123" offset="3277887">And of course, the circumstance that this did occur outside of the United States was no voluntary act of this individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="2691.409" offset="10871056">Yes, but I -- I would try to point that this is one of those cases in which the Court cannot accept that alternative because the countervailing arguments are so strong that the statute cannot be interpreted in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.293" offset="10918599">And I'd like if I may to run through them with these various arguments that we think they are very strong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.773" offset="10936466">The first is the -- the basic historical one that the parent statute did not relate only to desertions to the enemy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.639" offset="10968022">The second is the fact that the statute relates to desertion, which is a military crime, talks about the conviction by a court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.304" offset="10998638">Now, in military law, desertion is wholly -- desertion to the enemy is wholly irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.052" offset="11025596">The whole -- the whole question is whether you have deserted the armed forces of the United States and it is not part of the crime at all that you went over to the enemy or you didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.566" offset="11059660">And when Congress refers to the term which were -- since the beginning of our country has been known in military law and uses -- says that a conviction by a court-martial shall be adequate conviction for this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.931" offset="11113159">It must be referring to the military crime of desertion, which does not refer desertion to the enemy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.319" offset="11134683">And second, there's the -- third rather, there is the provision for restoration, which I mentioned just a few moments ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.717" offset="11164254">If the statute were limited to desertion to the enemy, it would be highly unlikely that there would be any provision for restoration, because any man who deserted to the enemy would be highly unlikely to come back to the forces of the United States, and if he did, it would be highly unlikely that anyone want to restore him to service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.836" offset="11232799">So, the whole provision for restoration wouldn't make sense, even if one didn't look at the legislative history, which I'll come to in a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.382" offset="11258922">It wouldn't make sense at all if the statute were initially limited to desertion to the enemy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.991" offset="11281387">And the forth factor is that, if this were a statute with limited to desertion to the enemy, it would be equivalent to treason provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.052" offset="11329661">And there's another provision in the statute, providing for loss of nationality for treason, that's Section 401 (h), and if -- if Mr. Fraenkel's view of the interpretation of the statute were correct, there would hardly be any difference between 401 (g), the desertion statute and 401 (h), the treason statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.852" offset="11420776">Another factor is that Congress specifically provided in this Nationality Act of 1940 that most of the acts of expatriation would not take effect with respect to loss of nationality, unless they are performed abroad or the person went abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.074" offset="11489740">It -- it made some exceptions to that and one of the specific exceptions made was this provision 401 (g), relating to desertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.227" offset="11518370">It specifically provided that except as provided in subsection (g) and so forth, expatriation shall not result until you go abroad or an act is done abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.972" offset="11561315">And that fact indicates very clearly that they were referring to desertions within the United States, and of course, it was highly unlikely that desertions to the enemy would occur within the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.545" offset="11611575">And fourth, and perhaps, most persuasive of all is the legislative history of the restoration provision which was enacted in January 1944, in which -- to which we have referred at page 9 of our brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.634" offset="11667999">That makes it, I think, irrefutably clear that Congress was concerned, not with man who deserted to the enemy, which at that time there were very few.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.456" offset="11703212">But if the great large mass of soldiers who were deserted in this country from training camps and so forth or who were deserted from training camps in England or abroad and they were -- they were interested in making sure that these people would not lose their nationality and that they would be -- if they were competent able fellows would be restored to duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.088" offset="11789730">And it -- I think it is impossible to read that legislative history and to conclude that this Section 401 (g) as it stood at the time it -- it affected this petitioner could possibly be construed as limited only to desertion to the enemy.</text>
