          <turn speaker="allan_r_rosenberg" startTime="0.000" stopTime="426.310">
            <label>Mr. Allan R. Rosenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">I very much doubt that the Court has an adequate idea of what the issues are in this case or what the -- particularly with respect to the factual nature of the problem involved here or what the issues are likely to be in the typical case involving an arbitration clause and the collective bargaining contract that contains a no-strike clause from the presentation of my Brother Farr.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.107" offset="255770">As I heard him, it was a little case involving Mr. Boiardi who wasn't getting paid and Mr. Armstrong who was improperly discharged so he claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.407" offset="297044">And these are things which really no one is being heard on and it's better to leave it to General Electric to decide whether or not this is arbitrable or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.982" offset="331316">And perhaps, the employees ought to be able to sue and without regard to the union and bypassing the union and go to some court where the state of federal depending on what's involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.511" offset="373426">And -- and of course, if the union -- if the employer refuses to arbitrate why the union has relief of its no-strike clause and that's all fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.175" offset="416057">Now, I submit that without an understanding of what is involved in this case and in other cases involving the kind of grievance to get something on the issue of arbitration and goes to Court, one will not appreciate the problem involved here without regard to the legal issues involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.462" offset="493171">Here, we start with a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.245" offset="516368">First, let me say that we have a local union, a local Massachusetts union representing the employees of the General Electric Company of Ashland, Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.632" offset="553880">The General Electric Company causes a New York Corporation in an industry affecting commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.794" offset="590555">The record has an uncontroverted affidavit that all the employees represented by or members of this local Massachusetts union are citizens of States other than New York and it gets Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.754" offset="666415">And the -- the factual basis of the case as far as that is concerned is that the parties are diverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.764" offset="722422">The contract was made in June of 1953 and it has been automatically renewed through August 1956 and is replaced in August 1956 by a five-year contract with this local union.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.471" offset="793266">So we have a situation different from that in the Lincoln Mills case where there was a termination of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.305" offset="828583">Here, there's been a continuous contract containing the same terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.801" offset="850526">Now, the terms of this contract with respect to the grievance procedure are the conventional four-step grievance procedure going through progressively higher levels from the lowest level of foremen to the plant manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.369" offset="912802">And if there is a dispute which is not settled in the grievance procedure, it goes to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.875" offset="934849">The only parties to the arbitration are the union and the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.888" offset="958882">The employees are excluded from its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.715" offset="970271">The union selects the arbitrator with the company, the cost of the arbitration, the entire administration of the arbitration agreement is in the hands of the union and the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.080" offset="1015724">Employees have no rights in that as such, not directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.663" offset="1042056">Now, there is a grievance -- a -- a no-strike provision in this contract and that is related to the grievance procedure and it permit strikes when grievances which have been processed and arbitration has not been resorted to, either party being able to resort to arbitration under the arbitration clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.522" offset="1145501">And there are further limitations about 60 days notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.856" offset="1166817">Now, there is the provision involved in the Boiardi grievance is set forth in Article IX and its first paragraph -- first numbered paragraph, "The company shall furnish the union within 30 days after the signing of this agreement a complete list of job classifications and rate ranges."</text>
            <text syncTime="287.660" offset="1253961">And the grievance here is that Boiardi is classifying at a job classification, repairman 3501, and he's not getting the rate for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.763" offset="1306415">What is the significance of that in this company?</text>
            <text syncTime="304.472" offset="1321253">It is that the rates that have been agreed upon, the whole rate structure of this company, is imperiled by what the union asserts to be a rate that's not -- that is being put into effect, that hasn't been bargained, that hasn't been furnished by the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.814" offset="1386663">This does not -- this is not approved wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.906" offset="1398993">It may result in six cents an hour, I think, the difference for this one individual employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.731" offset="1422294">But if the company, as it might turn out, for example, in arbitration, is able to put an 'L' after a rate, meaning learner, and pay six cents an hour or less for one rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.236" offset="1472345">There's no reason in the world I suppose that it can't do it after other rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.355" offset="1488750">So you have the whole rate structure of the General Electric Plant of Ashland involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.275" offset="1512469">This question involves whether or not the company has furnished a complete list of job descriptions and rate ranges to the union within 30 days after the signing of this contract in June of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.730" offset="1566281">That's what's involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.781" offset="1574536">What is involved is what not only Boiardi but every employee who has a job classification and a rate range is getting what the union and the company bargained to give him.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.983" offset="1619257">That's the problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.024" offset="1623437">Now, they're saying, no one is hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.388" offset="1632946">They say, let the employee sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.378" offset="1640887">Let the company decide whether it's arbitrable or not is to negate the purpose for which the collective bargain was made, should they strike or should they go to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.403" offset="1681011">They've chosen, as they have a right to do, to go to arbitration on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.029" offset="1695535">Now, the company could very well say, this is not arbitrable and tested out as it did in the Boston Herald-Traveler case.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.794" offset="1722598">But it takes the flat position, not that this isn't arbitrable, but there is no relief to be had in the federal courts in this contract of a manufacturing company with production and maintenance employees involved in a rate structure case which cuts across the whole of its -- of plant in -- in Ashland.</text>

            <label>Mr. Allan R. Rosenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="453.655" offset="1917994">Now, the Boiardi case -- I'm sorry, the Armstrong case arises out of a different section of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.179" offset="1948087">That section of the contract has to do with the grievance procedure itself and it concerns -- it's in Article 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.864" offset="1994794">And there is a clause concerning a grievance -- concerning dismissal for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.461" offset="2021230">Now, I cannot make the same argument about a dismissal for cause that I make about the rate structure in this plant, but I do make this that the -- in the first place, it's apparent that the underlying grievance that is beyond the -- the case on arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.622" offset="2085909">The -- the arbitration clause unquestionably runs to the union, qua union, so that we have here, as I suggest, a case appropriate for 301 jurisdiction whether it is a jurisdiction over the subject matter or jurisdiction to grant the particular kind of relief to one side.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.351" offset="2160828">We -- we have jurisdiction qua over a union controversy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.868" offset="2182875">And the underlying grievance in the Boiardi case concerns a promise that the company will turn over to the union not to Mr. Boiardi or to any of the 700 or 800 employees in this plant but it's a promise that runs to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.840" offset="2238777">That's the underlying grievance and then beyond that, there is Mr. Boiardi's right and the union's right to test whether that promise by the company to the union has been fulfilled.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.636" offset="2285902">In the Armstrong case, we have a situation that's not the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.953" offset="2307218">We have a man who is discharged and the only aspect of it that I would think the union has a direct interest in is the aspect that it hasn't all discharged for cause cases where the union's interest in -- in the law of the bargain, in the law of the collective bargaining contract were the company says, we shall not discharge except for cause or in this case, a more elliptical form of it, is observed for the protection of the individual members.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.530" offset="2429471">In that, the union has a stake, as I think it was pointed out in the -- Mr. Justice Frankfurter's opinion in the -- in the Westinghouse case.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.492" offset="2461341">These cases often triggered strikes and disputes which lead to strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.195" offset="2492165">So certainly with respect to the underlying premise in the -- in the rate structure case and the Boiardi case, we have a -- a situation which is kind of doubled bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.075" offset="2539708">We have, first, the premise running to the union to arbitrate and this involves a premise running to the union to turn over a complete list of right ranges and job descriptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.196" offset="2584116">Now, it is a fact, as Mr. Farr has pointed out, that this case was dismissed by the -- a motion to strike the equitable relief and finally, a final judgment had been granted by the District Court of Massachusetts in this case on the sole ground that the plain language of the Norris-LaGuardia Act forbids the issuance of the injunction as the Court called it sought in this case, what we sought in the complaint which was filed in December 1954 prior to Westinghouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.586" offset="2713684">And while the American Thread was the single case in Massachusetts in the Federal District Court there on that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.161" offset="2743986">What we sought was a decree of specific performance of this arbitration clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1077.550" offset="4413524">Hence, the Committee anticipates that the Board will develop by rules and regulations a policy of entertaining under these provisions and those provisions with the unfair labor practice provisions, if Your Honor will recall which would eventuate in a cease and desist and affirmative order requiring compliance with the terms that the particular case warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.787" offset="4494503">The Board will develop by rules and regulations a policy of entertaining under these provisions only such cases alleging violation of contract as cannot be settled by resort to the machinery established by the contract itself, voluntary arbitration or if necessary by litigation in court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1352.875" offset="5514846">The relief that maybe granted under Section 301 so construed is not a coextensive with the prohibitions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.291" offset="5556537">The Norris-LaGuardia Act doesn't prohibit everything that could be granted under Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.482" offset="5573256">It's evident in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.013" offset="5579421">It's evident I say in the Steele and Tunstall type of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.466" offset="5593213">It's evident in the -- in the case from the Third Circuit involving the S.O.-- Standard Oil of California of -- the S.O., Standard Oil case where the -- despite the Norris-LaGuardia Act, referred for the Court of Appeals from the Third Circuit issued an order directing the company to negotiate on a new wage rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.408" offset="5689031">Now, it -- I -- I say that the -- the a court could prohibit racial discrimination without violating, without running up against the interdictions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act under Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.071" offset="5751620">All I'm doing by way of illustration, if Your Honors please, is to show that if you construe Section 301 in the light of its legislative history, in the light of its attempt to make a binding enforceable agreement, in the light of the transfer of the specific performance aspects from the unfair labor practice sections of the Act which were omitted and in the placing of those sections in the Section 301, both in the House and the Senate version and the conference version, then it seems to me you get the result that Section 301, in the light of this legislative history in its own terms, authorizes the kind of equitable relief which Chief Judge Magruder talked about including the degree for specific performance of an arbitration agreement except whether Norris-LaGuardia Act apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.258" offset="5960391">That is to saying, if the attempt is made to enforce a no-strike clause in a -- under Section 301 by way of injunction, the Norris-LaGuardia Act would prevent it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.590" offset="6009710">And in the case in the First Circuit involving an attempt to prevent benefit payments, it would run up against the provisions -- the specific provisions of Section 4, that's Copra against Suro decided in 1956 in the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.589" offset="6077733">But there are provisions -- there is relief that maybe granted, as I construe Section 301 in the light of its legislative history, which do not encounter the prohibitions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act and one of those is the decree for specific performance of an arbitration agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.625" offset="6161847">Now, perhaps it is useful to point out some of the differences between this case and the preceding cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.646" offset="6213987">As I've already indicated, the contract in this case unlike the contracts in the other cases is still in existence, it has never terminated or at least it was an existence until August 1956 and then it was -- by agreement of the parties, replaced by a five-year contract containing the same terms and now in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.080" offset="6295698">Unlike the other two cases, General Electric is still in the business in Ashland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.301" offset="6316596">There is no termination of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.569" offset="6337599">These grievances, vary somewhat different relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="1600.388" offset="6504887">In this case, this is a particularly suitable case perhaps for arbitration because the union said in its grievance, the penalty of discharge is too severe indicating that they may have been a law legal right to discharge the man because he did not do what he was told to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="2382.895" offset="9634983">Now, on the Arbitration Act, but let me turn first to the exclusionary language in Section 1, the exclusion of contracts and employment of railroad -- of -- of seamen, railway men and other workers in interstate or foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.879" offset="9726934">I don't think there's any dispute that the objection was made for the bill when it was presented in the 64th Congress by Furuseth of the International Seamen's Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.059" offset="9779597">Now, it is said that the bill was solely commercial arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.121" offset="9795897">Well, it may have been so but they had a slipper in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.922" offset="9807078">They covered seamen's wagers, in any other matter which if the subject of controversy would be cognizable in admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.451" offset="9837171">So, when the question of seamen's wages under a compulsory arbitration statute as Furuseth viewed it, it came to the attention of Furuseth, he engaged in long analysis which is printed in the proceedings of the conventions of the International Seamen's Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.365" offset="9896835">The union adopted a resolution on compulsory labor which has been referred to and there was a discussion about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.801" offset="9918568">Now, the -- the -- there's no question that the -- the purpose, the -- the motive of the Seamen's Union was the protection of seamen particularly against the compulsory arbitration of seamen's wages, the right to put ship in harbor, protection under the Jones Act and the right to food.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.946" offset="10003205">These were the things that were mentioned in the analysis in the discussion and -- and partly in the resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.594" offset="10029746">And whether it includes railway men and transportation workers, let me quote to you what was said in the analysis, “The seamen having made the contract to serve must serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.252" offset="10072377">The railroad man having entered into a contract to serve with an arbitration clause inserted must continue to serve because such contract that comes through this law if enacted valid, enforceable, irrevocable save upon such crimes as existed law in equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.984" offset="10139355">And it says further that the -- the hunger of the -- the seamen's hunger and the hunger of the wife and children of the railway men and so with other hungry workers in interstate or foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.876" offset="10202885">That is said out in the analysis in the discussion and quoted in the brief -- in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.667" offset="10226082">What the -- what Furuseth was talking about was precisely what Secretary of Labor wrote, contracts of employment of seamen, railway men and other workers in interstate or foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.971" offset="10271222">That is an almost precise power to taking the classes of workers at first that's mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.734" offset="10290343">And when he was mentioned, it was individual contracts of hire, the railway men with the contract for arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.157" offset="10320018">The seamen with a shipping articles and so with other workers in interstate or foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.399" offset="10340916">Now, when the arbitration is -- when the proponents of the bill came, they talked about Stevedores, contracts with Stevedores.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.342" offset="10376756">There is no mentioned in anywhere in this by the proponents or the opponents of the bill of collective bargaining contracts except in first, that's analysis in which he says, if you put them -- if -- if the union makes a collective bargaining contract, it will be an out of danger because it will bind the members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.491" offset="10469334">The bill was brought up in the next session of Congress and they left out seamen's wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.057" offset="10495561">The slipper was removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.093" offset="10503711">But they still let in any other matter which are the subject of controversy would be cognizable in admiralty and that be meant food, Jones Act, right to put ship in harbor and other protections which the seamen had in -- under Maritime Legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.721" offset="10574242">And so, they opposed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.310" offset="10580616">And so the American Federation of Labor opposed that saying, the danger to seamen's wages is no mentioned of collective bargaining contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.111" offset="10615829">So, the American Bar Associations spoke about the reasons for the opposition as being due to compulsory arbitration of seamen's wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.577" offset="10649684">It is true that this was proposed by commercial legislation people leaving out the aspect of -- they are trying to get that seamen's wages and perhaps, some of these other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.981" offset="10691271">They were -- what was done, as a result of the protest in Section 1, was to exclude the thing about which the seamen's union was protesting, namely, the contracts of employment of seamen, railway men and other interstate and foreign commerce such as Stevedores.</text>

            <text syncTime="2744.475" offset="11081226">But if you take a look at the House Report on this, it says, and I think it's referred to in Mr. Justice Douglas' opinion in the -- the Court's opinion in the Bernhardt case, the matter is probably the subject to federal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.990" offset="11151339">I'm reading from report Number 96, whether an agreement for arbitration shall be enforced in that is a question of procedure to be determined by the lower court in which the proceeding is brought and not one of substantive law to be determined by the law of the forum which the contract was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.351" offset="11208808">Before such contracts, it could be enforced in the federal court before this law is essential, the Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.998" offset="11231378">The bill declared that such agreement shall be recognized and enforced by the courts of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.259" offset="11252381">The remedy is founded also upon the federal control over interstate commerce and over admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.760" offset="11278399">The control over interstate commerce reaches not only the physical interstate shipment of goods but also contracts relating to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.327" offset="11316642">Now, I submit that that is broadened to cover collective bargaining contracts which relate to interstate commerce and do not nearly relate to the interstate physical interstate shipment of goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.882" offset="11362931">I think that there is no valid basis for the argument that you're reading one broadly and one narrowly when you're talking about a protest over a particular item or particular category of employees who signed shipping articles or railway men who had contracts with arbitration clauses in Section 1 with this exclusionary language and the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce and this legislation in aid of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.089" offset="11479751">So I say that that is a ground which it seems to me sufficient to distinguish the -- the clauses in Section 1, the exclusionary clause and the power clause, the coverage clause in Section 2.</text>

            <text syncTime="3081.894" offset="12430921">Now, the reason I think, I -- I can only speculate because there is no legislative history, but you will recall that the Red Cross Line and the Atlantic Fruit Company case, it was decided in 1924.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.695" offset="12474180">And in that opinion, Mr. Justice Brandeis said that if an executory agreement will make a rule of court, it could be enforced even though there were no legislation on the subject.</text>
