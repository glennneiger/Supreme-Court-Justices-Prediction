            <label>Mr. William A. Stuart</label>
            <text syncTime="37.995" offset="255352">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.526" offset="277504">And if the Court will find that there's no material conflict in the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.521" offset="309478">The question involved as to whether strikers, even though nonstrikers who come back to work during the strike and before the Union has ordered back the body, the main body of the strikers, to come back and are reinstated in their permanent tenure whether they must be replaced or displaced in order to make run for the strikers who strike it out until the Union ordered them back.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.376" offset="524831">That is the prerogative question involved as to the effect, if any, of length of service upon the employees involved here, to the effect particularly of some of the employees who stuck it out to the end having greater length of service than the any employees who abandoned the strike and came back and were reinstated in a permanent tenure while the others were still there.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.246" offset="648338">Now, what happened in the case was that this employer which operates the plant at Morgantown, West Virginia, a chemical plant, made a study of the maintenance work with the view to determining why it was costing more than it seemed it should cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.754" offset="754395">As a result of that study, reorganization of the maintenance department was determined upon involving a reduction in force of 94 of the maintenance employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.910" offset="823045">However, before the layoff list could be prepared and the layoff made, the strike intervened.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.190" offset="864110">The maintenance force consisted of 234 employees, all of them union members, all of them members of these Unions who initiated the present proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.939" offset="931088">Now, the strike was an economic strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.641" offset="949896">There is no question anywhere in this case about any unfair labor practice being connected with the strike and the reduction of force was also an economic reduction, no question of any unfair labor practice in determining upon the number of employees to be replaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.983" offset="1067342">While bargaining negotiations were going on between the employer and these Unions for looking to -- making of a new collective agreement, the contract expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.228" offset="1140276">And some two weeks after that, the strike began there -- there being no contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.632" offset="1193880">As to the seniority rights -- the seniority rights expired as we contend with the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.450" offset="1229197">Those rights were purely breach of contract, and when the contract came to an end, so did the seniority rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.060" offset="1271620">Now all of this happened, the specific occurrences out of which this case finally -- although, all happened in -- in quite a short time.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.160" offset="1332015">The general workers and the maintenance workers didn't go out.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.386" offset="1356884">I mean the production workers didn't go out.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.502" offset="1369422">The maintenance workers went out on strike, the production workers did not and the company decided to attempt to continue to operate the plant and not to close down on account of the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.494" offset="1429400">Some other strikers, as I said, triggered back to work and among of them, there are seven who are the employers whom the Board, by its order, has directed to be reinstated in lieu of seven others who must thereby be displaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.421" offset="1529083">The company gave notice to the Unions after the strike had been going on about a couple of weeks that it would begin to interview applicants for jobs to replace the strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.688" offset="1626154">And two days after that, the Union ordered the whole mass of remaining strikers back to work without any settlement, not only saw that on a notice, this body of men just suddenly appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.592" offset="1697729">And at that time, on account of the previously determined reduction in force, there were 94 more employers applying for work and that were upon the job of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.679" offset="1794069">However, these employers all appeared at once, the company was wholly unfair that had no notice and liability of coming back, it couldn't tell of course how many had come whether all, or only a -- a large part and tell who had come and who had not.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.923" offset="1875048">So there, it was confronted with the -- upon the risk of what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.019" offset="1895424">Well what they did was to let them all in.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.002" offset="1915382">The plant had been strike bound now for some three weeks and -- and probably, there was plenty of -- of temporary work to be done so they -- they let them all in.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.720" offset="1982255">And they got down to work to make out the layoff list in preparation for putting into effect in the predetermined but delayed reduction in force.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.192" offset="2060100">And then -- well, in less than two weeks, after the balance of the strikers came back, this work was done and the names of the 94 would be laid off had been determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.267" offset="2140453">And then on April 2nd, the men were ordered back on the March 17th.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.782" offset="2162500">On April 2nd, the parties met in collective bargaining, well if you again can try to settle the issues which would follow the strike in which they again failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.237" offset="2228328">But at that meeting, the employers' representatives informed the Union that the layoff had been determined upon and gave notice as to the names of the employers who would be -- who would be laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.564" offset="2305651">And those employees included the seven who are the complainants here.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.032" offset="2343476">And they had greater length of service than the seven who had been -- who had returned earlier among -- they were among the trip that goes back, and who would have to be displaced upon the reinstatement of these seven.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.800" offset="2418604">And after this collective bargaining contract, the employer proposed a clause going to the seniority provision of the new collective agreement which confirmed that the employees who trickled back before the Union ordered back the bounds that they would have permanent tenure before the employees who came in at the end with respect to future layoffs' event.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.852" offset="2590804">In other words, providing that --</text>

            <text syncTime="625.547" offset="2605537">How was that done, by a general notice or just to -- to those who returned?</text>

            <text syncTime="630.058" offset="2623613">That was by a written proposal to the Union representatives on a clause to be included in the new collective agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="640.190" offset="2664155">No, I mean, this advised to those who returned before the main body of workers that they would have a permanent status.</text>

            <text syncTime="653.288" offset="2716505">In other words, the first notice of this was on the occasion of the collective bargaining for the new agreement subsequently for the return of everyone.</text>

            <text syncTime="659.420" offset="2741060">So far as the record shows, nothing was said one way or the other when the men came back or than the later time until the layoff list was being made out.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.572" offset="2793618">But I must say that the facts briefly and they indicate that it was assumed that this man did come back with permanent tenure that they were reinstated as returning strikers with permanent tenure.</text>

            <text syncTime="691.486" offset="2869269">You say it was assumed.</text>

            <label>Mr. William A. Stuart</label>

            <text syncTime="694.556" offset="2881599">The point was this, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.763" offset="2890376">As we contend, here was the plant with a number of available jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.735" offset="2914304">The plant was endeavoring to continue to operate, and were practically without maintenance employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.351" offset="2940740">There was a great need for maintenance employees in order to continue the operation of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.996" offset="2963310">Now, when these men came back, they were employees, they were on a strike, they were entitled to reinstatement and they got it.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.135" offset="2995911">And --</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="723.925" offset="2999045">Well, what I'm trying to get at of course is whether -- is there anything in this record which justifies an inference that one of the inducements to get these seven or whatever the number may be to come back in advance of the large body, was that they would, by coming back, get preferential status seniority wise?</text>

            <text syncTime="745.970" offset="3087235">No, Your Honor, and strangely, when I say strangely, and then relate the Court held that of that had happened, if the employer had offered the strikers as an inducement to return, the assurance of permanent tenure above those who would have, who stayed out, and then the decision would have been different.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.621" offset="3197889">But that would have brought it within the Mackay doctrine which I will -- will come to.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.018" offset="3223489">But that -- that position, we strongly disagree with.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.580" offset="3249716">If the Court please, we don't think that the employer had any right in the world to seek -- to get these employees to abandon the strike by offering them inducements.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.719" offset="3294229">And we think that it would have been sure to have been the object of a complaint by the Unions for strike breaking if it had done that.</text>

            <text syncTime="873.514" offset="3597458">But what Judge Dobie is talking about there is the proposal which the employer made and which the employer -- you know that would've put into effect when -- and then passed, developed in the bargaining negotiation doorway.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.096" offset="3663705">The proposal that the contract recognized the fact that these men who came back, while there were available jobs and before the body had been ordered back by the Union, did receive permanent tenure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2085.045" offset="8443591">And that is that here were returning strikers who applied for reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.757" offset="8478386">There were numerous jobs available at the time, they were entitled to reinstatement and permanent tenure and they got it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.702" offset="8514226">Now, when they were in there, they were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.736" offset="8530317">They had a position that they were entitled to and were entitled to defend against the other strikers who did -- who had not returned under the very clear holding of the Mackay decision as -- as we understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.283" offset="8588518">The -- the Mackay case says, he is not bound, the employer, he is not bound to destroy -- to discharge those higher, to fill the places of strikers upon the election of the latter to resume their employment in order to create places for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.746" offset="8658317">Well, now that's what the Board has done here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2189.843" offset="8862699">We contend that as a matter of law, these seven employees along with a number of others who returned before the strike was called off by the Unions that they acquired a status which they are entitled to hold.</text>

            <text syncTime="2253.009" offset="9115460">And they didn't go back to the time when the motivation would have counted, that's our point, when the motivation applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.092" offset="9139702">And the employer could have had only one motivation when these men presented themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.823" offset="9158614">And that was that it was his obligation to admit them to the plant and give them -- put them back to reinstatement in permanent tenure employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.904" offset="9194977">And that was the decisive time -- and that's when the status was fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.414" offset="9213053">Now that's our contention on what -- whatever the Board may have found as to the things that happened afterward, can't relate back to that, and our inference based on -- based on this black and white confirmation of a legal status which arose while the strike was going, can't -- can't affect that as we contend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.656" offset="9341994">Now, the -- I want to -- I want to say something here about the Court's decision because as the point file which I think is -- is quite well remarkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.718" offset="9446275">The Board and the Court found that this was a discriminatory interference with the exercise of the right to strike by rewarding the strikers who returned before for abandoning the strike and thereby penalizing the others for continuing to stay at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.189" offset="9532165">Now, that decision, if the Court will examine it on this point, is on extraordinarily narrow ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.616" offset="9577827">And that is this that the promise of permanent tenure was not made to these strikers before they returned from the strike and as an inducement to return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.609" offset="9637804">On page 30, here is what the Court said, "With a strike in progress, the primary concern of the employer is to keep his plant in operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.935" offset="9719097">It is then proper for an employer who might be unable to procure replacement save upon a promise of permanent tenure, to promise such tenure to the replacements."</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.667" offset="9774059">Now, that is evidently saying that if the employer had done that here, the decision would have been in his favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.135" offset="9803943">But says the Court, "When the strike is over, when the plant is in operation, then the imposition of the superseniority policy in favor of the replacements and against the strikers is quite a different matter."</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.881" offset="9862875">The whole thing is on that now and they've had it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.124" offset="9879907">That is the case before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.460" offset="9889207">There is nothing in the record here to show that at the time of Olin secured these replacements for the strikers, Olin made any promise of permanent tenure to these replacements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.278" offset="9936436">And within our brief, the Mackay case, as condoning this conduct on the part of Olin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.781" offset="9966529">Now, the Board -- the Board's conclusion was the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.849" offset="9982725">That simply follows the conclusion of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.789" offset="9994533">If their whole case turns from the fact that it wasn't necessary in the situation that existed in the strike, it wasn't necessary for the employer to promise these strikers any inducement in order to get him to come back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.364" offset="10064854">Since he came back voluntarily and the employer was not under the -- the pressure in endeavoring to keep its plant operating to approach them and offer them inducements to come, that therefore, the decision is against the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.324" offset="10144684">Whereas if the employer had done that, it would have been -- it would have been the employers' favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.687" offset="10170075">Now, we say and the cases that was cited in the brief that the employer couldn't possibly have done that without being open to a charge of strike breaking and we understand the Board to concede that in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.315" offset="10268609">Now, the -- the order of the Board on page 41 of the transcript says this, and I come back again to that matter of seniority and departure from the former seniority policy which the Board found.</text>

            <text syncTime="2858.008" offset="11535444">It's true that in Potlatch, the strike was settled at the bargaining conferences and this case was not settled but the announcement we made at exactly the same time, they were at the beginning of the bargaining conferences and that's where they argued to fail and after the plant was going on in collaboration.</text>

            <text syncTime="3000.577" offset="12105644">And the production record which was made during this period, this very critical period, it was going to determine whether at least it was going to be renewed or whether all these employees would be out of the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.469" offset="12153292">Now, that was the plant but as the -- the point about the plant being shutdown.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.524" offset="12169488">And if the contract, if Your Honor would look at the -- would -- would look at the exhibit and read that in this context, you will see that what Mr. Stull was talking about was the possibility that unless men were loyal to the job and the plant operated at -- at full blast and effectively that the plant wouldn't shutdown because the top measure would renew the list the following year.</text>
