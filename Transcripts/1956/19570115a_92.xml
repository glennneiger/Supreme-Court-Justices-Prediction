            <text syncTime="8.261" offset="136443">Mr. Levy, you may continue.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herbert Monte Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="10.386" offset="144906">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.999" offset="171342">Yesterday, in the four minutes that I had to argue, I attempted to establish that there was no question here actually of burden of proof in terms of the petitioner's showing of his good moral character that he made below.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.879" offset="242918">I would like to begin today by stressing the affirmative proof in relation to the petitioner that was given by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.078" offset="283669">The first and perhaps the most cogent point is that this man was a dupe of the Communist Party, who is duped into joining the Party in 1934 and left it in 1940 when he began to learn what it was all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.991" offset="351378">I think a special stress must be laid upon the fact that he testified without contradiction, without any doubt manifested anywhere else, that after he left the Party, he went to the FBI to be of assistance to them in the fight against communism.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.739" offset="410311">In other words, we have the picture of a man who has been an anti-Communist for at least a decade who is now barred from admission to the bar of a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.682" offset="454092">Among other reasons, I would say mainly, because of his past membership in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.549" offset="481573">I think it also deserves note that this man voluntarily admitted that he had once been a member of the Communist Party, going to the dean of the law school, admitting it to him in the very beginning without any request therefore.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.986" offset="531310">I think it should also be noted that he led an honorable life in the Army of the United States and received an honorable discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.170" offset="564015">I think it should further be noted in regard to what the respondent in terms of discrepancy in a number of arrests that he had undergone in California, that this man made a trip halfway across the country to California to find out exactly what the situation was as shown by the records in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.701" offset="638203">I think it is also worthy of note that this man presented not merely testimonials and affidavits and letters, but also presented live witnesses including the Rabbi of this Orthodox Jewish Synagogue, who testified as to his very high opinion of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.796" offset="710510">He presented the dean's secretary, who knew him fairly intimately, she said.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.739" offset="726288">And she testified too as to her very high opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.818" offset="738617">And the blind student, whom Schware had helped in law school over and above the call of duty, also testified as to his fine moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.970" offset="771218">This is in addition to the other point such as his conversion to religion, his establishing an anonymous scholarship for indigent students at the law school, letters of recommendation from virtually everybody there, etcetera, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.400" offset="832972">In terms, again, of the letters that he presented showing his high moral character, the respondent has raised some questions as to the lack of enthusiasm, so-called lack of enthusiasm in some of the letters which was submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.956" offset="907160">However, in other letters, which he of course does not advert to, I'm referring now to page 85 of the record, we find one person, Mr. Martinez testifying that, “Schware's moral character in my opinion is far and beyond the highest standard of any person I have ever come in contact with.”</text>
            <text syncTime="218.489" offset="977377">And then, on the next page 86 at the bottom, another person testifies that Schware is a person of the highest and best moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.715" offset="1010186">And at the bottom of 87, another person testifies, “That I know Mr. Schware to be open-handed charitable towards others and scrupulously honest in every situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.498" offset="1049370">Were he to represent me, I should have every confidence in his integrity.”</text>
            <text syncTime="240.720" offset="1066297">And again, on page 88, another person says in the center of the page, “That I find him trustworthy, honest and his character to my estimation is above reproach.”</text>
            <text syncTime="250.342" offset="1104750">So that I think we have here a case where whatever burden of proof there may have been as to his good moral character, Mr. Schware has sustained it more than admirably if ever there was a -- shall I call it a super prima facie case, I think this was it.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.004" offset="1183431">The record also shows that Mr. Schware had been an idealist all his life, that he joined the party for idealistic reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.712" offset="1210180">But when he found that this god had failed him, so many others had found in the past, he left the Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.191" offset="1236093">He himself was the person who furnished all the derogatory information against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.634" offset="1257932">He concealed nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.354" offset="1264828">He refused to answer no question.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.668" offset="1277994">I think it's also worthy of note that exactly the same decision in regard to his case was made by the Board of Bar Examiners before and after Mr. Schware introduced his affirmative evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.925" offset="1323029">In other words, the affirmative evidence apparently had no effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.673" offset="1342046">There is nothing in this record at all to show that anywhere in his whole life had Mr. Schware ever done anything indicating bad moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.816" offset="1382588">From my examination of the record, I think I can state that he had never violated the code of honesty, the code of morality, or the code of good social conduct.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herbert Monte Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="356.507" offset="1529396">-- they have received about Schware.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.961" offset="1543189">Actually, the burden of proof question is not really in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.674" offset="1566072">It's really a question of the standards they used.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.740" offset="1582373">The Court said at page 109 that its standard was of good moral character and I quote now from the top of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.347" offset="1616750">“They must consider two kinds of indirect evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.448" offset="1629184">First, the pattern of conduct an individual follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.550" offset="1641618">And second, the consideration of the regard his fellows and associates have for him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="389.212" offset="1660217">As to the pattern of conduct an individual follows, using the present tense, there is nothing which anyone could and I am sure there is nothing that the respondents contend, which had been reprehensible during the 15 years prior to the application for admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.026" offset="1731480">The Court actually just adverted very briefly in one-half of a page to this very fine record that Mr. Schware have had and they nowhere has related it to his present moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.722" offset="1790307">In regard to the second standard that they used, the consideration of the regard his fellows and associates have for him, at page 125, the Court said and I quote from the last paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.566" offset="1857599">“The record on which this -- second sentence, “The record on which this decision is based came from the petitioner himself, who presently enjoys good repute among his teachers, his fellow students, and associates and in his synagogue.”</text>
            <text syncTime="450.866" offset="1906813">So that is to the second criterion that the court used below, they obviously -- Schware had sustained that burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.547" offset="1937533">As to the pattern of conduct he follows, the Court nowhere has considered the conduct of the past 15 years and rested its decision entirely upon the basis of pre-1940 conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.153" offset="2000018">The burden of proof, by the way, is mentioned aside from that -- the use of the word on page 190 -- 109, comes up again only at pages 126, which is the tail end of the first opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.625" offset="2065847">And again, in page 150, in both of those cases, they took the question of good moral character is related solely to the question of past membership in the Communist Party and use of aliases, and the fact that there had been arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.521" offset="2129481">There is no question raised anywhere as in the opinion as to good moral character in any other way, shape, or form.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.436" offset="2173158">The testimony, I think I showed yesterday of the petitioner and his witnesses was all accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.976" offset="2203251">There was no question raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.807" offset="2210565">The only discrepancies that were mentioned at all was the fact that he had given an additional reason for using an alias at one particular point, plus the fact that Schware could not account for his addresses and employments during a particular period about 20 years previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.839" offset="2298755">And though the Court adverted to that, they did not rely upon that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.602" offset="2317772">They said that were it not -- they said that this would be devoid of explanation where it not for the fact that Schware led such a peripatetic existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.802" offset="2354552">But having led that existence, they felt there was certainly a reason explaining why he could not account for these particular times.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.816" offset="2394676">I might also add that -- or reiterate perhaps that the failure, the inability to account for certain periods of time with regard to employment and addresses was mentioned in Schware's application blank.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.445" offset="2457161">And again, to mention again what I said yesterday, the respondent said that at no time had they ever raised the contention that Schware's answers were anything but full, true and complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.807" offset="2518601">As they say, to quote it again on page 90, “Respondent has not made any claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.408" offset="2536991">The petitioner answered any questions in his applications other than fully and accurately, nor is the respondent's decision in the petitioner's case based upon any such claim, nor was the decision below based on any such claim," I might add.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.766" offset="2590386">The only question before this Court then, I think, is quite clearly, the three standards that were used.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.517" offset="2621419">As to the first standard, the question of membership in the Communist Party, this I think is central.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.425" offset="2669066">I think it must be remembered that the use of aliases and the fact of arrest had been disclosed in the application to take the bar examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.015" offset="2707414">Despite that disclosure, we find that the petitioner was advised that he was entitled to take the bar examination.That is alleged in paragraph (4) on page 1 of this record in the petition to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.249" offset="2768332">And that paragraph is specifically admitted on page 90, paragraph (5) of the response to the petition, that he had been advised that he was entitled to take the bar examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.315" offset="2820681">My opponent -- opponents say that he had merely been told to report for an examination, but again, the record stands very clear here that he was entitled to take the bar examination, that he had been so advised.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.573" offset="2881703">And --</text>

            <text syncTime="3120.518" offset="12585462">This is a review of a finding of fact made by a State Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.810" offset="12618585">The manner, in which the procedure in which the finding of fact was made, was not a typical lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.667" offset="12662053">It was not an adversary proceeding and issues weren't framed, and the decision was not very much like that in an ordinary common law action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.402" offset="12729031">The procedure is that the -- that a -- an applicant applies for admission to the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.369" offset="12772812">There is a -- no contrary pleading, no issue made up and the applicant comes to the Committee for the purpose of satisfying the Committee, that -- that he has the requisite, moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.001" offset="12875421">The Committee makes a determination on that in the absence of anything in the nature of issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.775" offset="12918471">After the determination was made in this particular case, the Committee decided adversely to the petitioner and advised him of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.751" offset="12974373">Subsequently, he asked for a hearing and again, a hearing was held without any further documentary alignment of the issues and the determination was reaffirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.875" offset="13026826">Then, he petitioned for review to the Supreme Court of New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.563" offset="13045635">Now, the Supreme Court of New Mexico in this case has decided what the procedure in the case should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.348" offset="13076773">There was no rule or statute that established the procedure and the procedure appears to be a petition for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.561" offset="13109582">To that petition, the bar examiners filed a response.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.248" offset="13124315">And in that response, there were admissions made concerning the truth of the matters that were testified to and the matters that were stated in the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.213" offset="13164231">Now, it is a fact that those are in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.483" offset="13181262">Actually, those admissions were disregarded in the subsequent hearing before the Court and they did not fulfill the function of pleadings in a normal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.806" offset="13230582">Ordinary pleadings fix the issues in advance of a hearing and as a consequence of that notice is given to the litigant that there -- as to the issue as to which he will present evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.298" offset="13292544">The response that was filed in this case was not a notice in advance of hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.218" offset="13316263">It was a notice after all the evidence had been received, and the admission in those circumstances was not considered by the Supreme Court in the manner that counsel has tried to use it in his argument here as in effect changing the rule of law, that the burden of proof is on a petitioner to establish his moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.826" offset="13422634">Now, this is a matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.026" offset="13427440">I submit that it's a matter of a law of New Mexico and the manner in which the State of New Mexico Supreme Court addressed itself to this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.932" offset="13475088">I submit it's the procedural framework on which this Court should also decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.519" offset="13501419">And our Supreme Court held and its holding is not at all unusual or different from that in other jurisdictions, that the -- that by applying for membership in the bar, an applicant thereby places his moral character in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.124" offset="13583862">And thereby, submits himself to a burden of persuasion, not a burden of going forward but the burden of persuasion in a broad sense of satisfying the bar examiners that he has a good moral character.</text>

            <text syncTime="3442.320" offset="13872671">So, the -- the determination of the Supreme Court boldly stated is that they did not consider that the petitioner had satisfied the burden of persuading them of good moral character.</text>

            <text syncTime="3765.091" offset="15163747">Under the law of New Mexico as determined by the New Mexico Supreme Court, those admissions in our response to the -- to the petition for review filed in the Court did not limit the issues and changed the burden of proof.</text>

            <text syncTime="3795.573" offset="15285687">Now, I might say in passing just to point out the fact that the pleadings as relied on by counsel are not so important, is that the original pleading which is filed by the petitioner in this case, the -- the petition for review contained many matters which are not now in consideration, including a claim that the standard of good moral character which is applied in New Mexico is unconstitutionally vague and void for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.664" offset="15414000">That has been abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.675" offset="15418075">A number of things have happened, in other words, since the pleadings were filed which do pinpoint the issue in the manner of which I have told the Court in response to Judge Frankfurter's questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3866.369" offset="15568854">There was no evidence introduced against the petitioner in this case.Counsel has mentioned that several times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.347" offset="15600724">From the nature of the inquiry, there ordinarily is not an inference from that circumstance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3994.543" offset="16081586">I think that while it isn't spelled out like findings and rulings, it is an opinion of the Court and perhaps is cryptical.I do think that the Court did have reference to that, yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="4006.860" offset="16130800">Now, the -- it is the position of the respondent in this case that the fact finder, the -- the bar examiners first as the recommender to the Court and the state -- and the State Supreme Court of New Mexico was not bound to accept his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.444" offset="16273115">Particularly, he was not bound to believe all the exculpatory things and all the inferences from exculpatory things that he said.</text>

            <text syncTime="6679.943" offset="26823137">I'm a member of the Utah Bar and it's three there but the investigation goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="6686.163" offset="26848005">I have one last thing to say, this Court has in the questions, indicated in insistence on equating the good moral character qualification to violations of law and I don't think that's necessarily true.</text>
            <text syncTime="6703.606" offset="26917804">For instance, if a man was arrested for rape, I'd say, and marries the girl, he can't be prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6710.307" offset="26944554">Yes, but the case has to be no-crossed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6712.700" offset="26954167">But that still indicates something or would indicate something as to his moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="6719.520" offset="26981439">The same way with adultery, we -- New Mexico has no statute on adultery.</text>
            <text syncTime="6723.599" offset="26997739">There are great many people who thinks -- think that an adulterer is a man of bad moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="6728.937" offset="27019160">I -- I don't think that there is necessarily a connection between the conviction, so far as moral character is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="6739.897" offset="27062941">I realized that on impeachment and criminal cases and so forth, that's required.</text>
            <text syncTime="6745.226" offset="27084257">But I don't think that it necessarily follows that you have to be convicted of a crime to have bad moral character.</text>

            <text syncTime="6762.110" offset="27151862">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="6763.883" offset="27158862">I'll be very brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6766.680" offset="27170043">I -- I have to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="6769.623" offset="27181850">First, to clarify the answers to -- the answers to some of Your Honor's questions about what was in this confidential report.</text>
            <text syncTime="6776.575" offset="27209644">On page 11 of the record, you find one of the Board members saying, “I don't think our action was motivated in any way by any accusations or anything was made against him or were disclosed in some way by a report.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6789.740" offset="27262307">Mr. Dunlevy, Schware's attorney, “Can I assume then that there is nothing adverse in that report?”</text>
            <text syncTime="6794.776" offset="27282474">Board member, “No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6796.395" offset="27288952">Another board member, “Nothing more adverse than what he,” meaning Schware, “said.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6801.432" offset="27309119">So they have read this.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="6802.835" offset="27314761">Well, it couldn't have been very serious because the only -- this member of the Court who had read it is Judge Kiker, and Judge Kiker was the only dissenting member of the Court, so it couldn't have been very damaging.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herbert Monte Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="6813.150" offset="27355930">Well, I don't know, but I do know that they checked into the arrest and that it was just sent here by the Attorney General and that they found nothing -- and in here, it is said that there was nothing more adverse in that report in what was set forth in the record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6830.350" offset="27424789">And this is one of the basis upon which they decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="6834.467" offset="27441194">There may of course also have been a lot in that confidential report which was favorable to Schware.</text>
            <text syncTime="6839.854" offset="27462823">And in terms of burden of proof, I noticed that what the Attorney General stated was that you need one letter of recommendation, apparently, as long as there isn't anything black against the man in order to get admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6853.525" offset="27517471">Now, here, what you have is endorsements by virtually everybody and the man is not admitted based purely upon what are really political judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="6864.542" offset="27561566">Now, I think the Chief Justice inquired whether the arrest in Texas for the stolen car, which was conceitedly completely innocent, whether that arrest had been considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="6876.414" offset="27609004">My only answer to that would be that the Court distinctly says that they rely upon the record of arrest, which includes that particular innocent arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6888.964" offset="27659264">They apparently rely upon the mere fact of arrest without any question even of the circumstances or actually of the innocence of the man.</text>
