            <label>Ms. Bessie Margolin</label>
            <text syncTime="35.912" offset="246993">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.387" offset="256920">This is a Fair Labor Standards Act case instituted by the Secretary of Labor to enjoin violations of the overtime and record keeping provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.089" offset="311777">The issue presented is a fairly simple one but highly important because upon it depends the application of three exemptions from the provisions of this Act, and exemptions which are from both the minimum wage and the overtime requirements of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.763" offset="398399">I refer to the exemptions relating to the retail or service establishment, retail or service establishments of which there are three related exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.836" offset="446673">The particular exemption involved here is the one in Section 13 (a) (2) which is -- has been in the Act since its original enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.408" offset="497037">A new -- two new exemptions were added in 1949 which also turn on the same key term which is retail or service establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.885" offset="546879">The establishment -- retail or service establishment exemption is for retail or service establishment whose sales of goods or services are local or intrastate and are retail in nature in certain prescribed degrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.128" offset="623888">That is more than 50% intrastate and at least 75% retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.349" offset="652727">The key term in these exemptions is the word establishment which, of course, must be identified before the percentage tests and the other conditions of these exemptions can be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.222" offset="700270">The sole issue in this case is what is the meaning of the term establishment as used in these exemptions?</text>
            <text syncTime="156.648" offset="729945">This is not an -- a novel an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.138" offset="739976">We believe that it was settled by this Court 12 years ago in the decision of Phillips Company v. Walling.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.773" offset="774457">And until the decision -- the decisions below in the instant case it was generally assumed that at least this aspect of this -- of these exemptions and of Section 13 (a) (2) which has other complicated features about it, but that at least this basic aspect that has been assumed was settled 12 years ago and assumed not merely by -- by the administrative officials but by the Court and by Congress in 1949 when it amended this Section in certain respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.953" offset="915205">The Phillips case, if I might just remind the Court before giving the facts of this particular case -- of the facts of the Phillips case, that case involved a chain of retail grocery stores in New England.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.846" offset="974764">There were 49 separate retail grocery stores and a central warehouse and office.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.208" offset="1000155">And this Court, after a very thorough analysis of this exemption and its intent and purpose, ruled that the term establishment refer to each physically distinct unit or place of business and not to the business enterprise or the chain system as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.929" offset="1079045">And it specifically said that the 49 retails stores were separate establishments as were -- as were the central warehouse and office building.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.991" offset="1127320">And it held -- it held this even though it expressly recognized that the separate units were functionally and organizationally completely meshed and integrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.901" offset="1170996">The Court pointed out that this was usually the case in a chain enterprise, that the very purpose of the chain enterprise was to integrate and -- and operate more economically by integrated and functional organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.246" offset="1244348">For -- for some 10 years subsequent to the Phillips decision that decision has been assumed to have settled the meaning of this Act -- of -- of this term in particular relation to multi-unit, multi-function chain organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.943" offset="1315192">The courts below, however, decline to recognize the Phillips decision as controlling in the instant case on the ground that the ruling in the Phillips decision as to the meaning of the term establishment was merely obiter dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.383" offset="1380916">And that other factors distinguishable from the facts in this particular case determined that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.171" offset="1412054">Now, we submit that the decisions below in so disregarding or so treating the specific thing on the meaning of the term establishment plainly misapprehended the -- the basic ruling of that decision and misunderstood the reasoning on which that particular ruling rested.</text>

            <label>Ms. Bessie Margolin</label>
            <text syncTime="369.638" offset="1581955">The functional aspect of -- has no bearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.559" offset="1593657">I should say this about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.046" offset="1599509">I think that the decision, the opinion recognizes that there is actually some functional identity in any of these chain organizations, that there is a functional identity to each separate unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.707" offset="1654157">That's a realistic fact which is just as present in this case as it was in Phillips.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.833" offset="1678712">But the emphasis was on the -- on the practical test of the physically distinct unit because it is a -- a realistic problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.533" offset="1717478">As the Court said the -- this exemption has a limited objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.009" offset="1735450">It was intended to exempt the small retailer and local retailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.090" offset="1755721">And the problem presented by these chain organizations is how to carry out that limited objective, give the chain organization the benefit of that objective and be sure that it gets the exemption for its local retailing but not to -- not to do violence to the exemption and the purpose of it by giving this whole harbored organization a complete exemption from the Act, simply because it combines its retail functions with a lot of other functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.387" offset="1888946">Now, the facts in this particular case, I think, well illustrate that realistic problem and illustrate the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.933" offset="1915068">The Court said that the key, the essential key to meeting that problem was the physically distinct unit standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.076" offset="1955715">Respondent in this case is the Bekins Van &amp; Storage Company of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.742" offset="1978389">It is a large multi-million dollar chain organization of storage warehouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.112" offset="2003780">It also does extensive moving where -- which is not involved in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.504" offset="2025409">We're concerned here with their storage warehouse business.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.882" offset="2042859">It has a large chain of -- of warehouses, 36 in the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.565" offset="2069608">It is the largest storage warehouse business in the country according to its own statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.345" offset="2096776">It -- it has admittedly engaged very extensively in interstate commerce as well as in intrastate household storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.938" offset="2131153">And it is also admittedly engaged quite extensively in non-retail business, as well as in the storage of household furniture which is considered to be retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.393" offset="2188936">The facts are -- are largely stipulated and are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.078" offset="2215685">It was stipulated after considerable negotiation and conferences, and I'll make a point of that because of -- of the fact that the respondent has -- seek to inject some doubt as to the facts into the case which I think the stipulation was expressly foreclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.573" offset="2297710">It was stipulated that if the Alameda warehouse, which is one of the warehouses, which is the one warehouse concerned in this particular suit, that if the Alameda warehouse was considered as a separate unit, for purposes of this exemption, it did not meet the percentage requirements of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.984" offset="2387257">In other words, more than 50% of its business was interstate and more than 25% of it, that is, at least 75% of it, was not -- was not retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.987" offset="2451310">Now, the factor that -- the point that respondent has sought to raise is a question as to whether or not all of the -- whether or not 75% of its business was retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.892" offset="2510973">That fact was expressly stipulated away because -- undoubtedly because respondent realized that the burden would be on the respondent to prove that it was retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.020" offset="2563427">And it was expressly agreed, therefore, that it did not meet the retail sales requirements if it was a single establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.927" offset="2599058">Now, it was also expressly agreed that if the division comprised of five large warehouses including a central office and which served all of the warehouses that if the five warehouses into which respondent classified -- classified Alameda as a part of a division if -- if that whole division were regarded as the establishment, then the requirements, the percentage requirements would be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.392" offset="2740955">In other words, 75% of their business was of the household storage character.</text>

            <text syncTime="667.180" offset="2772093">So that if the division here or what you call the division, it had to get a large office building where it could carry on all its functions physically it would not be within the Act but it would have to because of locality it went five separate buildings, that you can look at each one separately?</text>

            <text syncTime="688.512" offset="2857462">It's not quite in its -- it's a little more realistic than it sounds because there are a variety of reasons why one of these chain organizations developed.</text>

            <text syncTime="710.805" offset="2946591">It becomes a chain organization because it does -- spreads out and acquires a -- a lot of different places of business, and operates at various places of business and there are obviously business advantages to -- to placing your -- your business in various parts of a State or various parts of a country.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.174" offset="3040110">And the -- the various warehouses here, admittedly most of them, do carry on some of this commercial warehousing.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.476" offset="3085249">And I might say in regard to the non-retail business here, it's admittedly quite extensive even though it doesn't constitute as much as 25% of the total of the divisions of -- of the division's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.316" offset="3140629">This is a pretty huge outfit.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.009" offset="3151391">They do several million dollars worth of storage business a year of various kinds and 25% of their business being commercial means a -- quite a substantial amount of commercial warehousing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.714" offset="3218265">They -- the -- the -- in -- in fact, it's -- it's more than most single unit general merchandising warehouses do standing alone, the -- the total amount of -- of commercial warehousing by Bekins Company is admittedly a substantial business in and of itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.999" offset="3315336">It is -- it does distribute this commercial warehousing among several of its warehouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.559" offset="3341563">I think most of them have a little but it varies in degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.778" offset="3358490">Some of the -- some of the warehouses have very little of the commercial.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.985" offset="3375313">Alameda was chosen and I should say that the emphasis that -- that respondent places on the fact that only Alameda was claimed to be exempt should not be taken too literally because Alameda was chosen as being one that was clearly -- clearly performing so much commercial and so much interstate storage business that it could be definitely identified as not meeting the requirements of the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.643" offset="3517942">As to the other warehouses, I understand only one or two of them were even inspected.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.566" offset="3537586">There are, of course, practical limitations and limitations of appropriations that make it impossible to investigate it -- every unit of -- of a large chain.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.901" offset="3587009">Alameda was obviously, outstandingly devoted more to the commercial warehousing than the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.783" offset="3618461">There are facts in the record though that show that this is a fast-changing business, and that other of the warehouses were increasing their commercial warehousing.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.601" offset="3665795">And the investigation of this -- this last investigation occurred are now almost four years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.942" offset="3699127">I guess a little over four years now.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.501" offset="3709367">And it may well be that other of the warehouses and they have now become so much more commercial that they would no longer meet the requirements of the exemptions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1011.603" offset="4149791">The -- the question then was whether Alameda should be the -- it is the establishment to which the percentage test apply or whether all five of the -- of the warehouses including a central warehouse and -- and office, a central office building, should be a single establishment for purposes of determining the application of this exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.797" offset="4270582">The Alameda warehouse on -- is -- that is admittedly a set -- physically separate warehouse and it's admittedly in the heart of the industrial and commercial area of Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.146" offset="4331917">It's unlike some of the other warehouses in the division which are in largely residential areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.055" offset="4355636">It has some 60,000 square feet of space and there's no question, as I've said, that standing alone more than 25% of the storage is not retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.331" offset="4428675">There's no question either that the interstate business carried on by the warehouses in this division including Alameda as they get -- it's more than 50% in Alameda by stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.744" offset="4518327">These warehouses, these five warehouses are scattered over an area of some six miles in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.486" offset="4549360">Respondent has set up two divisions in the Los Angeles area -- area, the East Los Angeles and the West Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.639" offset="4577886">And these five warehouses in the East Los Angeles Division is the one -- is the one involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.925" offset="4611114">They cover an area of six miles, as I say, and each warehouse is at least a mile and three quarters, that is about two miles apart, distant from one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.325" offset="4660642">Each one has its own separate storing space and its own separate equipment, the Alameda has a-- is right beside a spur track of the Southern Pacific Rail -- Railroad and it -- each warehouse has its own working foreman -- its own foreman rather and its own working crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.235" offset="4748309">Now, respondent makes much of the fact that there's some interchange in the employees and the stipulation, I think, so agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.112" offset="4787806">But there's no question but that the employees were -- were generally identified with one particular warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.715" offset="4818213">In this warehouse, for example, there were 11 employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.350" offset="4832737">Now, it is true that when needed they were sometimes sent for a day or two to another warehouse but their identification was in the particular Alameda warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.537" offset="4877563">And that's assuming that that factor would have any bearing on it, we don't think it does, but the fact is that -- that each of these warehouses does operate functionally, independently to a large degree although, organizationally and managerially and for purposes of -- of finance, their financial arrangements, the company operates it as a -- as an organizational integrated unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.961" offset="4995218">The -- the location of the warehouses, undoubtedly, has something to do with -- with the nature of the functions performed there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.611" offset="5045791">Originally, Alameda was in a residential section and most of its warehousing was of household storage type.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.334" offset="5084662">It -- it later became surrounded with the industrial and commercial area, and it was natural for the type of its business to change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.439" offset="5125099">And there's no question but that location itself has some bearing on the -- on the character, the retailing and non-retail character of -- of the individual unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.122" offset="5179852">Now, the -- it -- it seem to us that -- it seems to us that the Phillips case is so clearly decisive in this respect that we find it difficult to -- to know how to treat the reasoning of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.993" offset="5263339">In effect, what the court below says is that establishment -- you -- establishment is something vague and variable depending on what the particular chain organization -- to how that the particular chain organization decides to run its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.491" offset="5333347">The -- it emphasizes that the Phillips case was dealing with the -- a wholesaler function, a kind of wholesaler function which is different from the function here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.656" offset="5389981">The fact of the matter is that -- that the function here is very -- very close -- very much alike to the function of the warehouse in the Phillips case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.321" offset="5432613">It is a wholesaler function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.617" offset="5441808">In the books in the standard authorities on general merchandise warehousing, they point out that the type of warehousing for dealers and manufacturers is a link in the service chain between the producer and the distributor and the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.034" offset="5511502">That's precisely the -- the type of function that the Phillips, the chain store warehouse serves, and the independent wholesaler warehouse serves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.194" offset="5548178">So we don't believe there's any factual distinction possible there without searching and trying to ferret out some insignificant factual difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.684" offset="5598124">I think it -- it might be pointed out with the -- with due respect to the Ninth Circuit that it has not had a case under this particular exemption since the Philipps decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.118" offset="5651832">The Ninth Circuit was one of the Courts of Appeals that had held contrary to the Phillips case prior to this Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.915" offset="5687045">It was one of the cases that was a -- a reason for the conflict that -- that brought about the grant of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.835" offset="5722676">And it seems that the Ninth Circuit unconsciously or instinctively was reverting back to its -- its previous reluctance to accept the Phillips decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.342" offset="5784743">The effect of it has been to revive all of the uncertainty that -- that previously existed prior to the Phillips decision when there was a great variety of opinions and conflicts among four or five circuits, and -- and the -- this -- this Court finally resolved it in the Phillips decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.759" offset="5878366">The Ninth Circuit's decision is of -- of particular importance because it seems to revive most of that uncertainty and that's the one -- one of the main reasons why we were concerned to have this Court consider it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1534.950" offset="6243140">That is a -- a problem which has given us some difficulty in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.701" offset="6262157">That question is not involved here, although, respondent has -- has cryptically suggested it might be because we deliberately stipulated that the commercial storage here was not retail, was very deliberately done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.546" offset="6321507">And I think there's enough in the record to support that but if there weren't, there's -- if it hadn't been stipulated, there's a great deal of other evidence which respondent well knows that they brought in to show that it is not recognized as retail in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.480" offset="6393292">There's a great deal of U.S. bonded storage, for example, at this warehouse which is the storage for customs on exports, the dealers and importers bring in.</text>

            <text syncTime="1820.758" offset="7386363">This was the holding in the United States Supreme Court in Phillips v. Walling and there's no intent in the proposed amendment to -- to change such holding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2203.650" offset="8917974">I might just say a word of moot -- about the mootness point which, however, I think, since has been raised at this late date by respondent that I would prefer to treat in rebuttal because I don't know to what extent he really intends to press it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.630" offset="8997909">He made all of the same arguments in response to the -- in our position to the petition of a certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.647" offset="9025912">Although, he refrained from claiming that the case was moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.067" offset="9043675">He claimed that this showed that the case was no longer of sufficient importance to warrant review by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.338" offset="9068753">But he didn't assert it was moot and we thought that the reason he didn't was that it was so clearly not moot under all of the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.560" offset="9109608">Now, for the first time in his brief, respondent does assert that the case is technically moot placing main reliance on the W.T. Grant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.134" offset="9151927">Well, the W.T. Grant case did not or it was not a ruling on -- on mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.406" offset="9177004">It was a ruling on the question of the discretion of the trial court to grant or to deny a relief where before the decision -- before the decision of the trial court it was -- there was admittedly a -- a cessation of the challenged conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.867" offset="9254849">There was no decision in the Grant case on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.493" offset="9265298">The Court -- the trial court simply held that since violations had admittedly ceased and there was no threat or no contention that they would be resumed, then in its discretion it denied an injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.393" offset="9332903">It was not outstanding, any decision on the merits which was claimed to be a -- a -- an authoritative decision as there is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.021" offset="9375431">And the Court specific -- this Court specifically held that that case was not moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.507" offset="9397373">It affirmed on the grounds that it was a proper exercise of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.119" offset="9419839">There's no question in this case as to the exercise of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.623" offset="9437915">Admittedly, the violations here of the non-compliance were continuing at the time of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.548" offset="9461530">Admittedly, they were still going on all through the appellate stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.845" offset="9478771">It's claimed only that the union agreement after the Court of Appeals decision puts a stop to the threat of violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.330" offset="9516701">Meanwhile, we've -- had continued -- we've had all this litigation, and respondent is still vehemently contending that his -- this conduct is legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.826" offset="9554631">And as I pointed out this has significance not only with respect to this particular warehouse but with respect to put potentially for other warehouses of respondent's own, as well as to establishments in virtually every other industry within the general coverage of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.297" offset="9632580">And there being that public interest in having it settled under this Court's decision it's -- it's plainly not moot.</text>

            <text syncTime="2403.871" offset="9718888">Respondent in this case is primarily engaged in the business of moving and storing household goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.452" offset="9749191">We've been referred to here as a multi-unit, multi-function business and I suppose in one sense we are but we certainly are not with respect to the -- the manner in which petitioner is referring to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.431" offset="9797047">We do move commercial businesses, we move stores, we handle and store office equipment, used furniture and that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.469" offset="9841246">We are organized into 12 divisions in and about the Los Angeles area, 19 throughout the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.533" offset="9877504">We are not contending here that the entire business is an establishment as was done in the case of Phillips.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.016" offset="9907388">We are perfectly willing to concede that each one of those 19 divisions constitutes an establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.218" offset="9932257">In this particular case, out of the 12 divisions in the Los Angeles area, there is one, the East Los Angeles Division that has 5 warehouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.186" offset="9964126">It is that division which is an issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.444" offset="9973112">It is one building, the Alameda building, which is questioned here by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.215" offset="9996204">I was a little surprised to find for the first time that she is creating the implication possibly that the Government contends that any of these other warehouses or divisions is not exempt by this Act because the findings of fact themselves specifically state the first finding, as a matter of fact, that plaintiff does not contend, the plaintiff being the Government, that any of defendant's warehouses either in the Los Angeles area or elsewhere failed to meet such test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.720" offset="10098291">And as a matter of fact at the trial it was specifically stated by counsel for the Government that there was no contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.941" offset="10123160">They conceded in effect that each one of these other divisions was exempt as a retail and service establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.481" offset="10153253">We have proceeded on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.457" offset="10161194">I think it's quite clearly of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.432" offset="10173106">So we are talking about just one building.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.614" offset="10189824">I would say that despite the constant use of the petitioner in their brief to such terms as huge enterprise, a large interstate multi-function, multi-unit business, that those terms would equally apply to anyone of the other divisions and anyone of the other warehouses which are not contended to be non-exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.776" offset="10310510">If those contingents were -- contentions were relevant to the determination with respect to Alameda, they would be equally relevant with respect to every one of the other divisions, the way we see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.501" offset="10353351">Now, with respect to the stipulation, we take strong exception to the fact that we have admitted that there are any retail or any wholesale sales at Alameda.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.362" offset="10392848">What we stipulated to was that we failed to meet the test proscribed by Section 13 (a) (2) to meet the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.485" offset="10433285">Now, one of those tests is the fact that we have to have less than 50% of our sales within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.195" offset="10472155">Well, it so happens that -- at Alameda we have a good many sales or services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.751" offset="10494412">However, this can be designated which go out of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.041" offset="10507577">Well, now merely because they go across state lines doesn't mean that they are wholesale certainly and I might also say this with respect to one or two matters that we've referred to in the brief that Congress has specifically stated, referring to Roland Electric Company that a sale to a business user doesn't lose its characteristic of being a retail sale merely because it's to a business user.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.616" offset="10605798">And I would be delighted if the Court would look at -- look at some of the legislative history was -- with respect to that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="2658.745" offset="10738395">The question of our size, our interstate activity, whether we engage in wholesale or retail functions has to do either with coverage, and that's not the question here, or it has to do with whether or not these tests are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.121" offset="10791894">That is not an issue here because we have stipulated that the tests are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.602" offset="10809762">If the division is the establishment, they are not in the case of the Alameda warehouse so all of these considerations are totally, in our opinion, irrelevant to the determination of this issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2695.598" offset="10885726">One other item which is referred to and I -- I'm using this approach because I think it's necessary to point out what is not an issue in order to get to what is an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.273" offset="10928462">Petitioner has in other cases and in our opinion correctly referred to the humanitarian nature of this Act and concludes from that as has this Court that the Act should be liberally extended insofar as coverage is concerned and that the exemptions should be strictly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.182" offset="11000142">We can agree and concede with that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.856" offset="11014771">I'd like to point out here, however, that I know -- I'd know -- and I would be very much surprised if petitioner knows whether or not more employees would be covered if petitioner's position were accepted or if our position were accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.817" offset="11078614">We have a simple question of defining a naked word "establishment."</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.203" offset="11092198">There are no humanitarian considerations involved in that case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.659" offset="11105991">And I might point out as an example referring to a case that I will get to later, Tobin versus Aibel, where the Government itself, that is the Wage and Hour Division, with respect to interpreting this very word "establishment" which it had used in one of its orders took the position that the word included two separate physical locations in one unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.796" offset="11198568">Now, that position was adopted which is our position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.274" offset="11216436">The result of the adopting of that position there was that those employees were included within the coverage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.331" offset="11244648">It so happens that here it's the same position which the Government took there were adopted they would not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.125" offset="11267845">Now, how many Tobin versus Aibel situations there are and how many Bekins Van and Storage situations there are, I don't think anybody knows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.384" offset="11296893">So, we don't know whether the position that the Government is taking here would include more employees or fewer employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.172" offset="11320090">It's quite possible that the position that we are taking here would be the one which would include more employees countrywide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.675" offset="11358124">Our position with respect to the very simple question involved here what does establishment mean, is simply this, we say that in deciding that question we have to look at all of the factors that are involved, all the facts in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.665" offset="11405981">There are many factors which bear upon that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.130" offset="11415907">We say that not the least among those factors is customary in an ordinary business, organization, operation, and practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.245" offset="11452374">We say that an establishment must be a unit which has some operational or functional identity and significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.898" offset="11486960">It has to be, in our opinion, something more than just a plain physical location.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.197" offset="11512142">We say the Government denies it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.248" offset="11524368">At least I assume that they deny it that their position is based upon physical location alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.222" offset="11544221">We say that they are taking that one factor, which is certainly relevant to this determination, out, separating it from all of the other factors and saying this alone must control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.738" offset="11582360">We say that is not a practical test at all and we think that the facts in this case amply demonstrate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.286" offset="11604511">Here we have a building in which 11 employees work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.994" offset="11631365">The top classification of employee is the working foreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.613" offset="11649860">They do work which is directly related to on-the-spot storing and directly related incidental activities, paperwork and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.839" offset="11694686">All of the management, executive, and administrative functions are performed on a division not a building basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.968" offset="11723212">For example, all records are kept on a division basis including payroll records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.062" offset="11747662">There is no one who is responsible for the operation of the Alameda warehouse alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.740" offset="11770337">All responsibility is on a division basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.220" offset="11792280">All the dispatching, all of the orders are done on a division basis, all the sales functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.343" offset="11812760">There's no territory that's divided up with respect to each separate warehouse or building, nor is there a -- an area of division with respect to storage assignments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.380" offset="11856854">This is just a plain building.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.253" offset="11868348">The Alameda warehouse doesn't sell anything to anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.030" offset="11883499">That is all done on a division basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.895" offset="11894993">Now, there are some occasional exemptions as we're presuming when somebody walks down the street and they have something to store they drop in and say, "Will you do it?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.160" offset="11928012">Well, naturally the answer is yes but then it is properly referred down to the division office where everything else is handled the dispatching and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.186" offset="11960090">There's a single system of accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.243" offset="11968345">One financial statement, one bank statement, supplies and purchases, all on a division basis, repairs and maintenance, all on a division basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.119" offset="12003871">Contrary to what petitioner has stated, the working force is interchangeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.367" offset="12020799">There's nothing in the record which would support the idea that a crew has an identity with respect to each individual building.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.672" offset="12050056">The record shows this and nothing more that they are regularly and frequently transferred from one building to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.220" offset="12076283">Very often when they have a big job, they will pull everybody out of all of the warehouses and they'll do a particular function here, there or someone at somewhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.878" offset="12106898">There's a single union contract that covers everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.531" offset="12117452">The senior -- the seniority provisions of that contract are equally applicable on a division-wide basis or larger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.540" offset="12145560">Now, I submit that on the basis of those facts, the facts in this case, that it is very difficult to contend that Alameda has any other identity except as a separate physical location.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.997" offset="12191326">It has no significance as a separate business unit of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.884" offset="12218911">As a matter of fact, the findings of fact specifically state that the business could be carried on as well or better if all of the warehouses were in one single location.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.292" offset="12268544">Now, I might point out that the petitioner, in response to a question by Mr. Justice Brennan with respect to the five buildings side-by-side, answered that question by saying that they would be separate establishments but why?</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.853" offset="12322774">Because in the cases that she has in mind, they refer to retail situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.961" offset="12347225">Well, if we had a retail situation at this building at Alameda then I doubt very much that we would be here but we don't have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.540" offset="12377527">And you will note that all of the judges below had pointed out but we doubt very much that the Government would take this position that all five warehouses were lined up side-by-side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.534" offset="12421517">In -- in sum and substance, the division is the only retailing entity which we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.407" offset="12448998">The findings of fact again point out that although the company has considered decentralizing, and that is their policy to decentralize as far as possible, they cannot decentralize this East Los Angeles Division without sacrificing efficiency, cost, and flexibility which they have to have in order to operate that division.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.338" offset="12532694">So, petitioner's position, we feel, has to be considered as stating that physical location alone must control this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.220" offset="12568221">As a matter of fact, in the court below it was specifically stated that since the Phillips case, organizational structure is immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.553" offset="12617540">Now, in our opinion this is totally an impractical (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.252" offset="12632377">For example, if we had the typical situation where there was one plant, everybody working on the same floor under one room.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.983" offset="12663306">We have various groups of employees headed by a working foreman, as it's true in this case, same records and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.577" offset="12693713">We just physically lifted for one reason or another lack of space.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.693" offset="12706147">That group of employees in one corner of the building, lifted them out, moved them outside, put them down, put the same -- put another roof over their heads, everything else is exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.363" offset="12748779">I don't see how petitioner, considering the position that it's taken in this case, to say anything other than that that group thereby becomes a separate establishment, the position which we think is untenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.487" offset="12801337">Then to complicate saying, where would the line be drawn?</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.534" offset="12813458">Say we have five buildings right next to each other, do they become each a separate establishment or say we move a building across the street, does that make it a separate establishment?</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.957" offset="12851179">It's because as the city puts through one-way streets and takes three blocks to get to the building across the street, does that make any difference and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.472" offset="12881272">We say that under the circumstances that cannot be any practical test at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3211.315" offset="12948668">Well, basically it's this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.643" offset="12953893">I -- I'm -- I'm going to cover that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.890" offset="12962983">It's this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.998" offset="12967372">This particular building, Alameda, was built over 50 years ago in 1898.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.303" offset="12984613">At that time in Los Angeles it was a residential area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.602" offset="13001749">During the intervening half century it has completely changed and now the Alameda area is surrounded by industrial -- an industrial area, an industrial zone entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.223" offset="13044276">Now, we brought that out to ourselves to show the change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.608" offset="13057755">The reasons for -- for the change in our operation has nothing to do with Alameda as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.823" offset="13078653">I think that petitioner in our brief and otherwise has come to the conclusion that that change means that the type of people that are served in Alameda are now commercial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.896" offset="13114911">That isn't the case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.791" offset="13122539">In the early days, the -- the Alameda warehouse would have served the people in the immediate area, but that has changed now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.742" offset="13150333">The result is that at the present time Alameda is nothing more than space.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.386" offset="13164962">It has no significance to its local surroundings at all except that - that there's a railway -- railroad track to it but there's also railroad tracks to one other in this Los Angeles Division (Inaudible) in the system, so that the change is significant because it has changed the nature of the business in the East Los Angeles area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.099" offset="13235806">For example, we now move a --a law office let's say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.056" offset="13247613">Well, we can't move a law office with just the people at one warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.079" offset="13259734">We may have to take a few from here, a few from there and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.967" offset="13271228">And the change in the type of business that the division does requires the flexibility and fluidity which we have here, that we -- that we have to have in East Los Angeles Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.570" offset="13309680">We couldn't do it, for example, if Alameda alone were the establishment or the unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.908" offset="13334967">We wouldn't have enough -- it wouldn't have enough flexibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.316" offset="13344684">So, the change in the surroundings has nothing to do with the type of business that Alameda as such conducts, nor the type of customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.727" offset="13382301">But as I say again, I -- we will define the wholesale versus retail function as being entirely irrelevant to the -- the decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.723" offset="13418245">The only test we think is -- which is a reasonable one is one which is -- the one that we had found in the law frequently, namely, we look at the whole picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.709" offset="13450219">All of the facts and then come to the conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.857" offset="13462758">That's done into any number of instances in determining whether or not that person is an independent contractor or an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.797" offset="13486582">All of where the facts fall as in every case differ.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.041" offset="13495568">You have to look at everything, decide after looking at the whole picture what is the right answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.334" offset="13516675">Now, we're not without legislative aids in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.130" offset="13531930">I think that Section 13 (a) (2), the Section in question, contains within itself the answer to this question, if nothing else to it, that Section talks about, any employee employed by any retail or service establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.533" offset="13593475">Well, I submit that employees are not employed by buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.999" offset="13607372">They're employed by business units.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.219" offset="13616253">I think when it uses that term "by" it must have some reference to a customary or ordinary business unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.614" offset="13645824">Again and perhaps even more telling is the term in that Section which says, establishments, it referred to establishment's annual dollar volume of sales of goods or services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.436" offset="13697128">Well now, how can that figure be determined on the basis of a building?</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.798" offset="13710608">We don't even have records for the Alameda building that would talk about annual dollar volumes of sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.026" offset="13731506">I doubt very much if we could determine exactly what the annual dollar volumes of sales were with respect to that building.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.763" offset="13754389">We have no records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.022" offset="13759509">The records are in no way broken down to refer to one building or another building that's distinguished from the whole division.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.896" offset="13786990">Secondly or thirdly rather, it refers to sales of goods or services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.329" offset="13804648">We don't have sales at Alameda.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.449" offset="13813217">There's no retailing function carried on there at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.005" offset="13823352">The retailing unit, the -- the point where customer contact is made is at the division office itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.691" offset="13854177">Now again, with respect to the legislative history, the reference was made that I have taken out a quotation rather seriously out of context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.953" offset="13895137">I feel this is the quotation on page 24 which is in the legislative history with respect to Section 13 (a) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.882" offset="13926902">I would say first that I think this quotation stands on its own feet quite aside from context, but I would go one step beyond that and say that I would be delighted if the Court would refer to the entire legislative history dealing with this Section.</text>
