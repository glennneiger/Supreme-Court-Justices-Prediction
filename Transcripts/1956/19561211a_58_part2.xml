            <label>Mr. Maurice J. Walsh</label>
            <text syncTime="3.132" offset="115858">If the Court please -- no rebuttal my time is short.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.260" offset="136443">There's one other point that I would like to discuss orally and that is the refusal to permit the examination by the defendant or to submit to the -- the defendant on the trial certain additional reports by the witness Durham, Agent Durham.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.508" offset="217422">And that arose in this fashion, Durham testified as you will recall that he had recovered this package which turned out to be narcotics from the seat of the informer's automobile or from the floor of the informer's automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.278" offset="276459">When the physical evidence was introduced, it was enclosed in an envelope which became Exhibit 6 and appears at an inscription which appeared on that, appears in the record at page 131.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.812" offset="334660">That document contradicts Mr. Durham's testimony and says that the matter when it comes to the words, were obtained -- how obtained, found by Officer James L.Bryson, that's the name of man who was in the trunk of the automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.331" offset="408743">Where obtained, 74th and St.Lawrence Avenue, Chicago, Illinois and that refers to the material.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.365" offset="436851">Now, this was called to Durham's attention and he was asked if that was not inconsistent with his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.171" offset="460048">He admitted it was and said that it must be a mistake by Agent Fields who filled out the envelope.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.183" offset="484080">Agent Fields on cross-examination when interrogated about this matter said that he had been given that information, the question was, “Who told you that this material enclosed in this envelope was found by Officer James Bryson at 74th and St.Lawrence?”</text>
            <text syncTime="116.410" offset="569031">“I think agent Durham gave me the information at that time, later the same day on August 13th.”</text>
            <text syncTime="122.536" offset="593481">And then he said that there was other information reported to him that he put on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.554" offset="613543">Now, the exhibit also bears, according to the testimony of both after it was filled up, the initials of Durham and that was after these inscriptions as to how it was recovered were on the envelope.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.743" offset="678327">The prosecutor then asked Fields in redirect whether this was the official report.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.987" offset="707271">The agent said no, it was a -- it was an evidence cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.342" offset="732766">I then asked if there were additional reports, written reports, by Mr. Durham concerning this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.781" offset="774457">And Fields said yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.056" offset="779577">I asked him if they were consistent with his testimony, he said he did not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.408" offset="797027">I asked the Government for production.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.091" offset="807685">The -- and asked the Court to compel it, the Court -- well, the prosecutor claimed no privilege for this -- for this report, for these additional reports covering this transaction but said that he didn't have them in court, he couldn't provide them until the next day at first.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.162" offset="879992">The Court said this trial will end tonight, we'll finish it today.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.859" offset="902771">The -- we then had some discussion of it, I urged the Gordon, the decision of this Court in the Gordon case where, what I conceive to be, a very similar situation arose and the Court thereupon denied production or inspection of the -- the additional reports of Mr. Durham covering this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.596" offset="1001723">My thought was in -- in seeking those was to find out whether his additional written matters, whether the other extra-judicial written statements by him were consistent with his testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="570.041" offset="2383496">Proof of his identity would not have shed any light at all on the -- on the undisputed illegal act of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.295" offset="2424560">It found that there were facts proved showing petitioner's possession of heroin which furnished prima facie evidence of guilt under Count 2 and left him with the burden to prove he possessed the narcotics legally.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.385" offset="2492897">They held that in as much as the sentence imposed was a general sentence and since guilt under Count 2 would support the sentence, it was immaterial whether error intervened as to Count 1.</text>
