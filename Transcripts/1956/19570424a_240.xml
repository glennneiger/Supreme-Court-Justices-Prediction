            <text syncTime="29.319" offset="220662">Mr. Chief Justice -- Justice Warren, if Your Honors please.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.091" offset="239783">This is another action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act tried in a state tribunal where the petitioner obtained a favorable verdict and judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.704" offset="306239">Appeal to the appellate court, the Court of Civil Appeals in Amarillo in the Seventh District reversed and rendered a take-nothing judgment for an injured employee of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.501" offset="381367">The decision was reversed on local practice and procedure pertaining to special issues whether or not the issue of unsafe place is an ultimate issue or whether it is overridden or destroyed by some other issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.019" offset="467466">That basically is the argument here I believe, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.695" offset="482200">Then to the action of the Amarillo Court in taking away the jury verdict was an invasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.953" offset="519189">I think it becomes important to know the facts here in order to determine whether or not the issue of unsafe-place was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.969" offset="559208">First, the railroad, the respondent, the Panhandle and Santa Fe Railway Company had constructed a passageway or a driveway adjacent to its station for the use of a mail truck operated by a contractor, Billings, who had a contract with the Government to pick up and deliver mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.882" offset="662862">The petitioner, Arnold, was a car inspector for the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.360" offset="684805">It was his duty to inspect cars not -- not in any particular time but that was his job and the facts will show that he had the right to select the time that he made the inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.023" offset="735483">On the occasion of his injury, January the 16th, 1952, while working in the yards at Lubbock, Texas and while inspecting three cars which the railroad respondent had placed on his spur track for that purpose, or person for that purpose, he was ran over by this mail truck which was backing out blind.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.056" offset="835584">Petitioner takes the position that the railroad created this unsafe place on his premises because it not only constructed and built the one way drive but directed its employee to work on the cars there.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.109" offset="903816">Admittedly, the drive where the injury was sustained was too narrow for the use of a truck and the employee at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.624" offset="949896">One must give way to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.295" offset="964524">As one of the witnesses testified, it is a very tight spot.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.904" offset="986990">Now, the jury found in support of petitioner's contention that the railroad was negligent in failing to furnish a reasonably safe place.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.139" offset="1043937">That was the approximate cause, not the sole cause but a proximate cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.560" offset="1069641">The jury also found on other issues that the petitioner, Mr. Arnold, was guilty of contributory negligence and that he had already seen the truck -- the mail truck parked down that driveway and he turned his back to it and walked away after performing his car inspection, and that he was guilty of negligence in failing to keep a proper lookout for himself which approximately caused his injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.589" offset="1181759">Now, may I specifically point out here, Your Honors, that the jury found that to be only a proximate cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.195" offset="1212165">The Amarillo Court says it was the sole proximate cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.775" offset="1230451">The Amarillo Court also went further to say that the man's injuries were sustained solely by reason of the presence of the Billings truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.491" offset="1273292">Billings' truck under the facts and -- and the fact -- the pertinent facts here are contained in the testimony of three witnesses, the petitioner Arnold, Mr. Humphrey (ph), the station agent and Mr. Billings, the third party contractor.</text>

            <text syncTime="519.972" offset="2183293">A further point, Your Honor, is -- my contention is that the railroad created that dangerous situation because railroad employees were actually assisting and loading the truck with mail and loaded the truck so high with mail that the driver could not see out of the rear window in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.130" offset="2279842">The only means he had a vision was -- were mirrors on either side and a testimony is that he could not see the petitioner, Arnold, as he was walking away from the last car.</text>

            <text syncTime="566.543" offset="2369494">The contention of the respondent is that since the jury exonerated the railroad and that it found that the railroad was not negligent in permitting the truck to occupy the premises or use his driveway that that destroyed the findings by the jury of unsafe place.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.141" offset="2451937">Going on further, the Amarillo Court which rendered a take-nothing judgment and reversed and rendered the judgment of the trial court found that the injury was solely due to the presence of the truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.785" offset="2550471">I do not think that is a proper application of the facts because certainly as Your Honor said in the Roger's case, the railroad in constructing such a narrow passageway contributed a little bit to the injuries of the petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="701.933" offset="2911065">One further point here, the Amarillo Court took the position that the unsafe place issue and I'm paraphrasing, it was longer than that but in this question as to whether or not the place of the respondent was unsafe.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.371" offset="2972818">The Amarillo Court held that it was not an ultimate issue, it was a general issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.497" offset="3009390">If it is a general issue, if Your Honors please, it is a general issue authorized by the Federal Employers' Liability Act because the Act, volume 45 Section 51 in the Code provides that one may obtain damages from the railroad due to negligence of its agent, servants or employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.994" offset="3099355">Partly cause -- partly causing the injury but the issue on unsafe place is based on the other face of the law where the railroad itself is negligent in providing a place with defects or insufficiencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.949" offset="3167169">So what would be the difference in the issue whether we use the word unsafe or insufficiently wide pathway?</text>
            <text syncTime="774.096" offset="3199770">I do not feel that the respondent can answer the position of the petitioner here, that this right of recovery under the Federal Act was destroyed by the local practice regarding special issues in our State.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.474" offset="3293288">It was a -- he has briefed a good common law action but he misses the point on Federal Employers' Liability Act because the Act provides if it can -- if the railroad contributed a little bit in its negligence to the injuries of the petitioner, then we are entitled to the damages as found by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.807" offset="3390568">This Court has so reasonably held in a similar case from my State, on a similar fact situation in the Deen versus Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe who wasn't -- which was not published at the time or out at the time we wrote our brief, the same fact situation except there it was inadequate or insufficient too.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.278" offset="3480534">Here, it is insufficient for an unsafe place because of the premises being too narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.835" offset="3510732">I think the most applicable case though under the facts is the Cahill case decided by this Honorable Court some time ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.575" offset="3553677">In that case, if you will recall, there was an employee of the railroad standing behind the train flagging motor traffic and the truck hit the employee and the holding of the Court in New York was that the truck's negligence or for its negligence as I recall was the sole proximate cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.574" offset="3653674">This Court said not the so.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.992" offset="3663391">The facts raised the issue of unsafe place because it was returned for further consideration of evidence, admissibility of evidence on car collisions at that particular intersection.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.133" offset="3735907">It is the further contention of petitioner here that the facts raised abundantly the issue of unsafe place because the unsafety which is admitted to some extent in respondent's brief was created by the railroad and its ownership, its operation, its maintenance and control of not only its premises but the very movement of the truck which hit the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.470" offset="3873207">And I would like to reserve some of my time to answer the respondent.</text>

            <text syncTime="958.179" offset="3936110">In the first place, I would like to point out some distinctions between the Deen case which was decided by this Honorable Court just a few weeks ago and this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.818" offset="3998595">I happen to be familiar with the Deen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.898" offset="4010924">There, the question was whether the railway company was required to furnish two safe ways to do the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.433" offset="4049063">This Court held that the case should be reversed to determine that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.570" offset="4089605">Also, there was no contention in the Deen case that specific issues controlled a general issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.493" offset="4137357">Now, that is our contention here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.395" offset="4160972">They submitted over our objection in the trial of this case the general issue as to whether this defendant failed to furnish a reasonably safe place to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.615" offset="4225860">We object to that because it was general.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.153" offset="4239966">There was no definition of safe place to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.061" offset="4255640">It was controlled and it could be controlled by specific issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.573" offset="4277687">Petitioner in the trial court requested specific issues which went to the question of reasonable safe place to work and they were submitted by the trial court along with this general issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.308" offset="4364622">Those specifics, which are found in the Court's chart referred to in our brief in which I will discuss if time permits, fully took out of the case any question of our failure to furnish a reasonably safe place to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.196" offset="4460126">Now, there is one other thing that I'm not sure that this Court is clear on to this point in the argument and that is this, there were two defendants in the trial of this case in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.469" offset="4533269">This truck was not owned by the Panhandle and Santa Fe Railway Company, the respondent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.010" offset="4567437">It was owned and operated by Billings Transfer and Storage Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.408" offset="4600978">This transfer and storage company had a contract with the United States Government for the hauling of mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.888" offset="4638908">And it was the employee Billings who ran over and injured this petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.534" offset="4681540">In pleading the case in the trial court, there were seven allegations of negligence as against the railway company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.253" offset="4720410">There were 11 allegations of negligence as against Billings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.145" offset="4751966">When all of these issues were presented to the jury, the juy exonerated the truck driver who committed the overt act from backing without giving a warning, from backing without clear vision that is backing his truck, from driving too fast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.201" offset="4860217">The jury exonerated this defendant Billings from all of those specific acts of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.645" offset="4897938">It too exonerated Panhandle and Santa Fe Railway Company, petitioner, of all specific acts of negligence but it found against it on the one general issue.</text>
