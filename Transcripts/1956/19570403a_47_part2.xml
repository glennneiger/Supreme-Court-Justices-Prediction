            <label>Mr. Samuel C. McMorris</label>
            <text syncTime="7.713" offset="134248">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.140" offset="139891">Now, may I answer to the best of my ability the last question presented was why was she arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.363" offset="156818">I have two theories because one, there is the type of arrest where they simply a false arrest in which a police officer just stopped anybody they have the faintest suspicion, it might be dope users, something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.358" offset="200808">Then you -- they arrest you, search you, check your arms.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.926" offset="211048">If you've got them, it marks the person you arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.975" offset="223274">Recently, one of the few and we spoke with the facts in -- in California, particularly certain neighborhoods.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.240" offset="248351">They may be minority neighborhoods or they may be the Skid Row neighborhood, but there are neighborhoods where you simply have false arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.044" offset="267577">My second theory is the officer may have mistaken her for someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.287" offset="284505">But neither event she wasn't who he thought she was and -- and upon finding no present violation of crime they held her for not having arrested for crimes she committed four years ago of which she had no notice or duty to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.713" offset="330271">And now, I repeat that I think that in orders like this to be reasonable, to be constitutional, must keep notice as on Section 290 of our penal code, which requires that a person -- the Court could -- puts him on probation or the -- or the probation officer when the -- or the warden or some -- and some -- or to somebody to have him sign in writing or have been told that I must register.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.170" offset="412087">Then of course if they commit the crime they have had some prior knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.591" offset="425775">This is not the kind of thing in which I think mens rea may be dispensed with.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.225" offset="440299">I think taken the Kahriger case from this Court, on the registration of -- of gamblers as an example in which this Court went even further.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.276" offset="520443">And here, a person who knew he had a duty to register, but did not do so because he thought that was unconstitutional to require him to register, was held to be not violative of the statute because in here we don't even have a notice to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.014" offset="575404">And the other person was held guilty of failing to do what he's -- have never been told they had to do, which you couldn't learn in due course, in normal course that you had to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.040" offset="607483">It's not like selling meat or driving a car where you have an affirmative act about which you can get advice or have you inspect those meat.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.114" offset="635800">Here is an act, a big thing to abstract which you ought to know you have to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.224" offset="656280">And how many are faced before that category which no one has any notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.828" offset="670699">I think that notice in this type of ordinance as -- and it isn't all federal ordinance of the type where they got hold a person for violation of an ordinance to do something or law to do something.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.218" offset="708211">And same thing was said in the Kahriger case on the gamblers registration law.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.173" offset="728064">Now, it is also my point that the law requires self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.900" offset="771009">We have in California case, I cite on page 14 of my brief, People against McCormick which held that the law requiring Communist to register was unconstitutional because it was self-incriminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.243" offset="812387">And we submit for reasons pointed out here, I won't take too much time because my time is expiring.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.006" offset="827434">The reason pointed out in the brief, we submit, that this ordinance is in the same category.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.467" offset="841226">Particularly, in view of the fact that we have to reveal past criminality and that California has a statute on habitual criminality which you must reveal under this particular law.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.411" offset="885008">And the McCormick case if applied equally to Ms.Lambert would have -- would have outbid this -- this conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.024" offset="911444">Now, as I was saying this -- this law is unreasonable and that it is not applied and that no one registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.246" offset="936312">Only 10% has registered and most of them have no notice, except those who have registered and the ones who have notice under 290 penal codes.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.230" offset="964315">Very few register as felons generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.831" offset="974660">So -- so the law serves no purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.449" offset="981138">In fact, this is conceded by the appellee when he states that well, it doesn't do any harm because we're going to find out through the FBI records anyhow.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.032" offset="1007470">But then I submit let's rely on the FBI records and not invade the privacy of people who -- who have served their time and want to be decent citizens again.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.755" offset="1034428">Let's rely upon the FBI records and not upon self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.283" offset="1048534">Now, the appellee in -- in their brief measured many other types of registration which have been held valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.427" offset="1077060">May I submit that every type mentioned here does not fall in the category of criminal registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.407" offset="1100988">They are not with reference to crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.834" offset="1106735">In criminal matters, we have special constitutional protection which do not apply to registration of lobbyist, registration of other type of employees or participant employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.889" offset="1138918">These are not criminals as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.798" offset="1146546">They are people simply who were -- must be regulated and therefore must register.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.332" offset="1160652">No amount of criminal prosecution or attempt to prosecute or salutation of ones own prosecution nor as self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.516" offset="1193462">I submit that the statute is too vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.965" offset="1203284">In the first place, it requires a person to interpret the -- the California distinction between felonies and misdemeanors, since it applies to felons only.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.628" offset="1237870">And second -- and this is a very difficulty thing for the courts to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.382" offset="1252916">And second, it permits the Police Chief to write in certain things under -- under I think Section 10 of the -- of the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.512" offset="1285413">Police Chief may -- may require anything else he desires as far as registration is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.116" offset="1303803">And I submit that the catchall phrase such as that may be appropriate to Constitution as giving legislative power.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.343" offset="1324701">But in this case, you give legislative power to Chief of Police that that in itself is unconstitutional due to the vagueness of the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.817" offset="1366601">I submit further that this is unreasonable and that it -- and that -- that real -- the people who should register will not -- the only innocent people who did not intend to commit a crime again will register.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.760" offset="1418428">So it has -- so it does not serve the purpose for which it is intended, though it is an invasion upon privacy of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.965" offset="1447267">And now, just a minute on the -- I submit that Ms.Lambert was denied procedural due process first, by failure to expunge a record with which she had a right to.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.328" offset="1484675">Second, by the false arrest as outlined in our brief, there was certainly a false arrest without a warrant, without a statement of reason or fact of arrest, without permitting me to talk to her and that she was only charged with crime to protect this false arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.804" offset="1534621">It is our reason why this crime was only brought nicely as to -- was brought in this case to protect the false arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.176" offset="1556041">And the purpose of our law is not to justify police officers, make things easy before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.540" offset="1573491">Our basic value to democracy is not the facilitation of prosecution or protection of police officers from false arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.223" offset="1600240">Now, I think their sentence was unreasonable and that trial court indicated throughout the trial such practice against her as to deny her due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.390" offset="1636916">Particularly -- and arbitrate some of the transcript on appeal and in the failure of the appellate court to give her as she requested the verbatim report of the trial under the forma pauperis provision which had been legislated during the pendency of these proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="427.753" offset="1814340">Some time in the 1930's, the City of Los Angeles passed the ordinance here in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.955" offset="1839208">In substance, it requires all persons who had previously been convicted of a felony whether in the State of California or elsewhere if the crime were punishable in California as a felony, certain types of misdemeanors to register within five days after they came to the City of Los Angeles intending to reside there.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.826" offset="1950699">They also provided in that ordinance that persons who did not reside in the city, who, during a 30-day period came into the city more than five days should register if they have in fact been convicted of a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.118" offset="2027813">They also provided that persons who moved were required to give their notice or change of address.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.109" offset="2063757">The statute defined convicted person as those who had been convicted, as I heretofore stated, of a felony in California or a crime which would have been punishable at -- a felony if committed in the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.918" offset="2127078">It also provided that persons who had accepted the provisions of the probation law and whose records were expunged upon a satisfactory showing of fulfilling their terms and conditions of probation were thereafter not deemed to be convicted persons so that they would not thereafter be required to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.666" offset="2218088">They enacted another subdivision which enumerated certain specific types of crimes dealing with sex violations, rapes, assault with intent to commit rape, indecent exposure, delude and dissolute misdemeanor types of crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.153" offset="2295933">And they provided that those persons who came within that subdivision (d), even though their records had been expunged under the probation laws, were still deemed to be convicted persons so that there would be the requirement that they register in addition.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.751" offset="2374405">This appellant, however, only comes under the first classification, a person who had been convicted of a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.908" offset="2407006">The facts as I see them are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.048" offset="2427591">A verified complaint was filed in the municipal court of the Los Angeles judicial district, charging appellant with having violated subdivision (a) of Section 5239 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code, charging that she had in fact been convicted of two prior felonies, forgeries.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.476" offset="2505226">That she had lived and remained in the City of Los Angeles for more than the five-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.343" offset="2532707">That her record of conviction had not been expunged and that she did not register as required by the ordinance.</text>

            <text syncTime="662.908" offset="2754957">They did start on the day such as January 1st, 1921 to bring the thing -- or these terms of the ordinance up-to-date.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.181" offset="2792051">Those persons, who, subsequent to January 1st, 1921 had been convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.209" offset="2812217">In any event this complaint was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.285" offset="2820472">Appellant was arraigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.917" offset="2831026">They chose to file a demurrer to the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.815" offset="2850670">At that time constitutional issues were raised, amongst those that the statute was unconstitutional, that there was an abuse of the process of the Court, unlawful search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.340" offset="2904691">Of course at that time on the hearing of the demurrer only the constitutional issues were raised and considered, whether the ordinance on its face was an invalid police regulation, matters of evidence were not gone into.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.456" offset="2961220">The demurrer was overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.284" offset="2968534">The matter -- plea of not guilty was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.892" offset="2978983">The matter was set for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.029" offset="2987447">At the time of trial a jury was selected and before the trial actually got started I think the Court noticed that there was a mistake in the date.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.285" offset="3028511">We called counsel to the bench and discussed the matter with them and granted leave to file an amended complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.066" offset="3055679">An amended complaint was thereafter filed correcting the date.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.168" offset="3068008">I think that occurred on two occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.438" offset="3081174">Before the introduction of evidence, counsel for appellant again urged the constitutional grounds and also urged unreasonable searches and seizures, police brutality, and anything else that came to mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.634" offset="3133942">The Court merely passing on the constitutionality of a statute overruled the objection to the introduction of evidence and the matter proceeded to trial on the second amended complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.024" offset="3187440">When witnesses for the people were called, they called the clerk of a Superior Court as I recall and introduced certified copies of these judgements of convictions of the felonies for forgery.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.225" offset="3236237">They were introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.121" offset="3243865">Thereafter, witnesses were called to prove that the defendant or that the appellant was a resident of the City of Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.494" offset="3277302">Upon the calling of the witness, it was stipulated that the appellant was a resident of the City of Los Angeles for the time charged in the complaint, in fact for seven and a half year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.312" offset="3324635">Thereafter, when a witness was called to show that the records of the convictions of felonies had not been expunged, it was stipulated that that was true, that these records had not been expunged at the time of the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.188" offset="3380120">When -- I think each and everyone of the elements to that extent were offered to be proved by the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.237" offset="3424319">There was the stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.220" offset="3428289">The people then rested.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.731" offset="3442291">The defendant or appellant then offered evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.281" offset="3464547">Some of it was admitted, some was objected to.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.223" offset="3476250">The net result was that she testified that she didn't know whether or not she had been convicted of a felony because at the time of sentence she fainted.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.564" offset="3509582">But she does -- did recall reading of the charges and that she was present when the Court imposed the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.927" offset="3543124">There was some cross-examination as to her hearing the charges, knowing that they were forgeries.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.543" offset="3573530">These matters of course went to credibility of her knowledge of whether she was in fact convicted of a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.554" offset="3597563">Thereafter, the jury was orally instructed and they returned a verdict of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.105" offset="3623790">After the jury returned its verdict, appellant made a motion for dismissal in the interest of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.124" offset="3659839">He raised the contention that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.634" offset="3681886">He also said that the defendant was only technically guilty of this offense, because she had a right to have her record expunged and I think at that time he asserted that she did actually have the record expunged.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.820" offset="3742699">And he further contented that this was vindicating the action of two police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.042" offset="3779584">This motion was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.898" offset="3787003">Thereafter, a motion in arrest of judgement was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.314" offset="3804662">In this motion, in arrest of judgement, it was urged that this statute was unconstitutional in violation of the spirit of the Federal Constitution and of the State Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.857" offset="3846771">That it was an improper police regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.156" offset="3867982">That it misused in this particular case, voided the judgement.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.843" offset="3886791">That it was for the purpose of vindicating the will of two officers and he at that time offered to prove the facts concerning the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.259" offset="3932453">He offered at that time to show that she was stopped in the middle of the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.665" offset="3950007">Her sleeves were rolled up.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.009" offset="3955440">She was looked -- they were looking for narcotics and some other reason, and that she was thereafter arrested, not being told why she was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.258" offset="3992430">He offered to prove that the counsel was present at the time that the officers would not allow him to talk to the appellant, and that later these charges were then filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.889" offset="4042898">I have pointed out in my brief and appended thereto the statute which authorizes a motion in arrest of judgement.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.114" offset="4075813">That motion is addressed solely to the phase of the accusatory pleading, and at that time you may question the constitutionality of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.764" offset="4114474">It is not the same as a motion for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.451" offset="4133177">It only goes to the validity of the accusatory pleading itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.157" offset="4151986">That motion was then denied properly by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.212" offset="4168182">An appeal -- at that time the Court imposed sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.322" offset="4184691">The sentence was as follows, imposition of sentence suspended for three years which is a method of granting probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.935" offset="4219068">The defendant placed on probation for that length -- period of time on condition --</text>

            <text syncTime="1051.665" offset="4310079">Then the appeal was taken under California procedure a defendant may appeal from an order denying a motion for a new trial, from a final judgement of conviction, from an order of granting or denying probation, or from an order made after judgement affecting substantial rights of a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.557" offset="4397641">In this case, the appellants appealed from a final judgement of conviction and the briefs were filed in the appellate department, and it was pointed out by the respondent that in this case there was no final judgement of conviction but an order granting probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.570" offset="4461693">We find the words that have been heretofore alluded to mentioned in the opinion of the appellate department, rather than dismiss the appeal they said we will consider this as properly before the Court.</text>
