            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">If the Court please, in my remaining time -- no authority which we say exist for these partial certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.317" offset="176671">On pages -- beginning at the bottom of page 60 and 61 of our brief in Allen-Bradley, appears in Section 124 (f) which is the crucial Section -- this interpretation we disagree with on the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.889" offset="254934">That Section is entitled, “determination of adjusted basis of emergency facilities,” and says this, “In determining, for the purposes of subsection (a),” which is the basic definition, “the adjusted basis of an emergency facility,” that's the basis on which you take your tax amortization.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.655" offset="341974">“One, there shall be included only so much of the amount otherwise constituting such adjusted basis.”</text>
            <text syncTime="67.975" offset="375306">As it's properly attributable to such construction, reconstruction, erection, installation or acquisition after December 31, 1939, as either the Secretary of War or the Secretary of the Navy, and that now includes the WPB by transfer, has certified as necessary in the interest of national defense during the emergency period.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.195" offset="472168">And the statute goes on to say, “It should be under regulations approved by the President.”</text>
            <text syncTime="97.415" offset="493066">Now, we scarcely offer this section as a model of legislative draftsmanship.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.511" offset="521383">It is not the clearest choice of language in the world, but we believe that the statute is broad enough to encompass the congressional intent.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harvey W. Peters</label>
            <text syncTime="132.379" offset="632874">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.359" offset="648756">In as much as the Government is here requesting whether determination and judgment granted the Allen-Bradley Company by the Court of Claims be reversed, I think it proper that we consider exactly what was before the Court of Claims in the case there.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.290" offset="728482">Reading from the record, page 4, paragraph (c) of the Allen-Bradley Company petition states, "In connection with such expansion and pursuant to the provisions of Section 124 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, the plaintiff filed for and was issued nine necessity certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.479" offset="829315">In each and every instance, the duly designated certifying authority determined that the facilities described in the plaintiff's application for a necessity certificate were necessary in the interest of national defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.847" offset="890755">However, in three instances, the duly designated certifying authority certified less than 100% of the cost of the facilities described in and covered by the necessity certificate as amortizable under Section 124 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.130" offset="983855">In other words, in our petition, we pleaded the fact that these facilities in every case had been determined to be necessary for national defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.715" offset="1026278">We pleaded also that the duly designated certifying authority cut the cost for amortization purposes to an amount less than 100%.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.042" offset="1067551">Now, in an answer filed by the Government which is contained beginning on page 11 of the record, reading there, "Admits the allegations of paragraph 6 (a), (b) and (c)."</text>
            <text syncTime="258.165" offset="1135992">The portion I quoted from just a moment ago is included in paragraph 6 (c) and was admitted to by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.338" offset="1184684">The Government filed its answer in the Court of Claims on November 15th, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.384" offset="1224913">In order to get the matter expeditiously taken cared of, we filed a motion for a summary judgment on November 21st, 1955 or less than one week after the answer was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.044" offset="1283532">In our motion for a summary judgment, we emphasized the fact that the Government had admitted to all of the essential facts and the Government had offered no defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.436" offset="1333164">As a matter of fact, the only item even constituting a slight defense in the Government's answer is the prayer wherefore defendant phrased that plaintiff take nothing from it in this suit and that the same be dismissed with cause against the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.113" offset="1399829">Now, in our motion for a summary judgment, we request that the facts are found as stated in the petition filed on behalf of the plaintiff, the Allen-Bradley Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.923" offset="1451029">And number two, that judgment shall be entered for plaintiff, the Allen-Bradley Company against the defendant, in the United States of America for the sum of $178,000 and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.337" offset="1496691">Well, at that stage of the proceeding, what did the Government do?</text>
            <text syncTime="354.090" offset="1519783">The Government filed an answer which the Government generally stated that the Government is still litigating the issue and believes its position taken in a week in so higher power and so forth to be correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.635" offset="1573909">It pointed to the fact that the Tax Code Of The United States in the case of National Lead had decided the case adversely to the Government too and I am quoting now from the Government's answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.151" offset="1616018">“However, an appeal was filed from that decision with the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which was argued on January 13th, 1956 but has not yet been decided by that Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.745" offset="1670353">If the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit decides the issue in favor of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.435" offset="1689161">The question will undoubtedly be ultimately decided by the Supreme Court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.533" offset="1713507">Again, nothing further by way of the defense other than the information that the litigation was continuing and that there was a possibility of review by the United States Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.872" offset="1758856">Now, the National Lead opinion, the National Lead case was decided by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on February 14th, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.049" offset="1803577">And the case was submitted by the parties in the Court of Claims without argument on March 5th, 1956, at which time, again the Government filed a one-page defendant's memorandum of additional authority citing the National Lead case decision by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.808" offset="1890617">Now, the point I want to make is I do not consider the Supreme Court of the United States as a trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.354" offset="1916740">I do not consider that the Government should be in the position of sitting back and stating nothing, giving no position, giving no authority, not even stating the grounds upon which it is seeking to defeat our claim until the petition for certiorari was filed with the United States Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.735" offset="2010363">And I might state in that respect that it is set forth in our brief, that is quite well-established and it is contained in the rules of the Court of Claims that if there is an affirmative defense, the matter should be raised in a pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.578" offset="2097716">And in this particular case, I want to emphasize the fact that the Government cannot claim that it had no knowledge of the position that it would ultimately hope to advance in this Court, because as a matter of fact, the National Lead decision of the Second Circuit was almost one week short of a-month-old when the case was submitted without argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="531.528" offset="2229478">But what -- I don't quite grasp your point that the Government had filed the -- the petition, had it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Harvey W. Peters</label>
            <text syncTime="540.480" offset="2265318">The taxpayer had filed a petition with the Court of Claims in which we alleged that these certificates, that these facilities were found 100% necessary and the Government agreed with that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.567" offset="2325608">We, of course, pointed out in our petition that the certifying authority did limit the cost for amortization purposes.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harvey_w_peters" startTime="563.623" stopTime="878.059">
            <label>Mr. Harvey W. Peters</label>
            <text syncTime="563.623" offset="2357896">Now, throughout all of these proceedings in the Court of Claims, the Government has never advanced the point as to why our certificate should be denied other than the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.113" offset="2411813">They have never -- that the administrative authority, in other words, had the authority to issue fractional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.276" offset="2444518">Now, in its brief before this Court, the Government, I -- I get the point now that you're asking, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.669" offset="2474088">The Government raises a point we're guilty of laches, that if we had any relief, it was to go back to the certifying authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.510" offset="2505435">Now, for the first time, that point is raised.It was never raised before even though the -- the Government had knowledge of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals' opinion in the National Lead case.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.100" offset="2559770">Now, let's go on to the matter of the law.First of all, in the briefs, there is some rather broad language dealing with the matter of the authority of the certifying authority to issue fractional certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.066" offset="2631659">In the first place, we claim that isn't at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.136" offset="2647960">We claim that the Government has admitted we had a 100% certificates even though the certifying authority limited us as to the amount of the cost.I think it important to specify.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.277" offset="2700518">And when we use language such as the alternative of issuing a certificate or of having the Government finance the facility, there are several other things that should be given some consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.044" offset="2759555">In the first place, when an application was filed or when a certificate of necessity was granted, there was no knowledge as to ultimate cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.462" offset="2805217">The application gave the estimated cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.217" offset="2816188">For instance, as the record shows in our case on page 5, we filed an application with estimated cost of $927,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.344" offset="2860701">When the final cost was computed, the cost for amortization purpose was a $1,014,000 or approximately 10% more than the estimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.192" offset="2904168">Now, there was no element of control over that, whether you put a -- a percentage figure in there or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.361" offset="2940844">Again, on the record on page 6, we filed an application estimated cost $274,600, the eventual cost only $126,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.069" offset="2999672">And in like manner, the third certificate varied also as to the final cost in relation to the estimated cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.751" offset="3034363">Now, it has been stated here that the purpose of this partial certificate or partial cost certificates was to allow a certificate in cases where it was decided that a partial certificate was better than the Government financing and or the Government building the facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.523" offset="3157452">Once again, I want to point out that in the case of our certificates, there were involved buildings which were immediately adjacent to the taxpayer's buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.768" offset="3206457">Now, I think the taxpayer might have had some question about putting an office building -- or I mean a factory building connecting up with its own building, floor-by-floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.226" offset="3248253">Secondly, there was involved special machinery and that special machinery was entirely within the know-how of the Allen-Bradley Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.717" offset="3294229">It wasn't the type of machinery that you could buy at commercial sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.917" offset="3311052">It could only be built by the Allen-Bradley personnel and under the supervision of Allen-Bradley engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.289" offset="3352534">In other words, it wasn't just the case of the Government going out and purchasing a milling machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.607" offset="3409795">There is also been made the comment that originally, 100% certificates were issued, but at later, our productive capacity was inflated to, or shall we say, increased to quite an extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.836" offset="3486699">And at that point, the War Production Board decided that we had enough of defense facilities acquired under certificates and perhaps this was the time in which the Government could consider the post-war usability and the amount of money that the Government could realize out of the sale of these facilities in the post-war world.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.122" offset="3607907">Now, let's examine that a moment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1736.075" offset="7047711">In other words, if you are a corporation or some other employer and you're going to put five million more in -- in additional plant, the Second Revenue Act and succeeding Revenue Act said, “We are going to take every cent of that income."</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.723" offset="7106226">Well, where was the incentive for building a million dollar plant?It was exactly in this amortization provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.373" offset="7140916">In other words, since your income was 85% taxable anyway, you could, by building a million dollar plant have an actual cost of $150,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.886" offset="7190967">At the end of the war, that plant might be useless, but at least you would have suffered nothing but that you would have had a new plant at a cost of $150,000.</text>
