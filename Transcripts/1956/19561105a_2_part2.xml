            <text syncTime="1920.962" offset="7683762">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.692" offset="7686687">With this further suggestion that if in the intervening period they determined that it just isn't feasible for them and they just can't carry this thing out, they can then go before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.652" offset="7758576">I think it's -- it's rather significant here that this company is -- indicates that it has no wish to try to sell abroad and yet quite significantly, it felt it was worth $40,000 to it to purchase the rights to do business in South America.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.645" offset="7838511">So that when they say they have no desire to go abroad but we think it's pretty clear and it's also shown by the way in which they keep referring orders to these foreign companies unless the foreign company agrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.317" offset="7897234">In situations where they get the consent of the foreign company, they have no hesitancy in shipping an order into the territory of that company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.722" offset="7930880">So that, we think it's pretty clear from this record that this company is staying out of these territories not because as a matter of business judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.944" offset="7971736">It doesn't think it wants to do business in these areas but rather because these agreements are bound to it to stay out and in turn, the other companies are giving it absence of competition in the domestic market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.494" offset="8029936">Now, we think, Mr. Chief Justice, that a combination of the giving them some measure of discretion in the exercise of business judgment where it's appropriate that they should not take certain steps in combination with these specific steps, would be a admirable solution to this -- what seems to be this dilemma or one hand, a need for something to be done and on the other hand, the problem of -- we -- we don't want to put them in the position where they feel they've got a club hanging over them that they -- we -- we're not suggesting they had to go abroad and get themselves subjected to serious damage suits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2227.374" offset="8909427">It seems to me that the discussion of counsel for the Government has ignored one vital fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.222" offset="8944849">That is that the record already shows in this case how this company deems it reasonable to conduct its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.067" offset="8988212">And it is incontrovertible on the record that we deem it reasonable, in fact necessary in the conduct of our business to sell through skill-trained engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.274" offset="9049025">In other words, the product, the physical product of Holophane Company Inc. is sold 75% in conjunction with the engineering service which it renders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.480" offset="9109838">Indeed, engineering service, scientific lighting service is the chief product of Holophane Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.668" offset="9150589">Therefore, to have on hand, even unmarked or newly marked glass to say nothing of the shadiness of circumvention implied in that resort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.863" offset="9219448">To have on hand that glass when the Government says, “You are not expected to send somebody abroad to sell it,” is imposing upon this small company a financial burden which it should not be required to assume.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.480" offset="9289874">Because in order to have newly marked or unmarked glass, cutting right across its whole inventory, it must make an entirely new set of glass for expert -- export purposes and would be subjected to an irretrievable cost in doing that upon the theory that we are not expected to send somebody abroad.</text>
