            <label>Mr. Harold I. Cammer</label>
            <text syncTime="32.085" offset="231737">The petitioner, Ben Gold, was convicted on two counts of filing a false affidavit under Section 9 (h) of the Taft-Hartley law.Gold executed this affidavit, which, by statute, is at the present tense, on August 29, 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.164" offset="332048">He was at that time and for 13 years preceding the execution of this affidavit, he had been president of the Fur and Leather Workers Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.841" offset="390771">By its verdict, the jury found first that on August 29, 1950, Gold, as he knew, was a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.110" offset="447822">And second, that on the same day, Gold, as he knew, supported an organization which advocated the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.617" offset="517831">For about 30 years before August 1950, Gold had been a leading member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.638" offset="561925">This membership, he had always openly acknowledged and even proclaimed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.483" offset="589302">It was common knowledge in the fur industry, in the leather industry, in the trade union movement, and elsewhere that Ben Gold was a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.699" offset="646144">Between the enactment of the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947 and May of 1950, the union had refused to comply with the filing requirement of Section 9 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="154.074" offset="719705">On May 8th, 1950, this Court in Douds sustained the constitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.397" offset="760978">At the union's biannual convention held two weeks later, Gold suggested to the union, advised the union that in view of the decision the time would come for the union to comply with the filing requirements of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.637" offset="833912">And he stated to the convention that if it adopted his resignation, he was uncertain -- his recommendation, he was undecided whether he would quit his union office or whether he would thereupon quit the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.466" offset="917191">The convention voted to comply and gave Gold time to reach a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.714" offset="954180">Within the next two or three months, delegations of union members called upon Gold and urged him in the interest of the union to remain as president.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.578" offset="1009664">On August 24th, 1950, Gold sent a letter to the National Secretary of the Communist Party in which he said, “Dear Gus, the letter was to Gus Hall, I am herewith submitting my resignation from, and severing my affiliation with, the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.697" offset="1110183">Fraternally yours, Ben Gold.”</text>
            <text syncTime="257.511" offset="1133380">Five days later, on August 29th, 1950, Gold signed the 9 (h) affidavit and the next day filed it with the Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.807" offset="1190640">At the time of his resignation, Gold issued a public announcement of his resignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.928" offset="1223032">In this resignation, he expressed -- in this announcement, he expressed indignation against Section 9 (h) of the Taft-Hartley law to which he referred as a slave labor law.He said that neither he nor the Communist Party had at anytime advocated the overthrow from any democratically-elected government.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.871" offset="1326895">On the contrary he said, Communist, workers, trade unionist, liberals, and progressives fought for and appreciated democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.290" offset="1376528">That was only the profiteers who opposed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.410" offset="1393037">He concluded by saying that although he had resigned from the Communist Party, he did not thereby give up his belief in true democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.371" offset="1436818">And that therefore, he would continue to work for the repeal of the Taft-Hartley law and for the reenactment of the Wagner Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.753" offset="1482376">In this trial, no witness testified and the record contains no evidence that after Gold had filed his resignation from the Communist Party he had had any communications or any transactions or any conversations with the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.937" offset="1579133">The record does not show that he had attended any meetings of the Communist Party whether open meetings, close meetings, secret meetings, or that he paid any dues or that he carried out party assignment, submitted to its discipline or engaged in any conduct whatever, indicative of membership in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.520" offset="1685504">Neither does the record contain any evidence and no witness testified that after he had signed the affidavit he said or did anything which supported the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.319" offset="1768678">Nevertheless, the Government urges that Gold continued to be a member despite his resignation and that his continued membership fulfilled its allegations to prove under both counts of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.498" offset="1841403">In other words, that his membership constituted support on which he was convicted on the third count.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.133" offset="1883930">As evidence of its claim of continued membership after the resignation, the Government relies upon three things plus some additional factors, which while they were pressed and relied upon heavily at the trial, are presented now as make weight or corroboration.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.835" offset="1986748">The three principal items relied on by the Government are these, first, that Gold having been for 30 years a hardcore member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.357" offset="2052786">The jury could infer from that fact that he was the kind of a Communist who would submit a sham resignation from the Party and falsely swear that he was no longer a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.860" offset="2106807">Second, the Gold -- the Government relies on the fact that in January of 1948, nearly three years before he had signed the affidavit and more than two years before this Court sustained 9 (h) in Douds, Gold had attended a meeting between -- between officers or leaders of the Communist Party and officials of some left-wing trade unions for the purpose of determining what the point he has added to Harvey's policy towards 9 (h) should be and whether the Party should give permission to left-wing union officials or Communist Party union officials to comply with Section 9 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="557.673" offset="2334072">The Government's witness who testified to this meeting, testified and said that the outcome of the meeting was that permission would not be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.729" offset="2386317">From this the Government argues that there is an inescapable inference that because for a deduction or an inference, that because the Party had discussed in January 1948 the -- the question of granting permission, it necessarily meant that if permission had been granted the Communist trade union leaders would have then filed false affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.925" offset="2519124">And we -- we submit that this is a surmise which is no better than a surmise that if the Party had granted permission at that time to file the affidavits, it might just as well have instructed the trade union people either to get out of the Party or to quit their union office.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.143" offset="2619956">Thirdly, the Government relies on the testimony of two witnesses which are not supported by any facts but stated as a conclusion that the Party had a policy of favoring the submission of sham resignations and the filing thereupon of false 9 (h) affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.719" offset="2730297">To these three main items of its case, the Government adds the following, first, four of its professional witnesses testified that Mr. Gold's statement that he had resigned from the Communist Party but did not thereupon give up his belief into democracy meant that he was thereby reaffirming his membership in the Party and that this was soapy in language, so that the resignation meant to read the exact opposite of what it said and was thereby a reaffirmation.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.128" offset="2895914">Now, these witnesses -- of these four witnesses, none of them testified to any conversation or transaction with Mr. Gold except one who had last talked to him in 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.513" offset="2969475">Another one had never seen him or met him.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.956" offset="2983163">The others testified to having seen him last one in 1940 and another last 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.268" offset="3016495">And while these witnesses were presented as experts in the Communist Party's use of language, none of them claimed and did not assert any expertise in the defendants, in Mr. Gold use of language.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.381" offset="3092877">The only evidence which is in this case is that the defendant was very fond of using the terms democracy and true democracy and that he had frequently used them in the deferring to the Government of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.242" offset="3164348">Secondly, the Government argues that there was testimony in this case that there was no such thing as the resignation from the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.704" offset="3214190">There -- there is no such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.781" offset="3222444">You cannot resign from the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.571" offset="3237700">On the basis of this testimony, the prosecutor, three times, told the jury and in considerable -- at considerable length that membership in the Communist Party is like membership in the United States Army, the United States Navy, the United States Marine Corp and the United States Air Corp.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.457" offset="3313246">And the only way you can get out of the Communist Party, just as the only way you can get out of the armed services, is by being drummed out in court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.651" offset="3357968">Of course, these witnesses -- themselves, three of them had left the Party without incident and official F.B.I figures show that certainly in recent times tens of thousands of persons have been dropping -- have dropped out of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.999" offset="3447411">In substantiation of the can't resign theory, the Government had its witnesses testify that on five or six occasions after Gold had resigned, the Daily Worker had referred to Gold in matter of fact terms and without abusing him.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.892" offset="3546990">The fact that he was referred to without abuse means that he was favorably referred to and these ex-Communist witnesses gave that as their opinion that if he had resigned, the Daily Worker would not have spoken of him without abusing him.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.489" offset="3633298">Now, some of this testimony was qualified, some said that the Daily Worker would not have carried these favorable references if he had in fact broken with the Party or that if he had testified against it or if he had denounced it.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.078" offset="3711666">Fourthly, the Government relies on the fact that in 1951 -- in 1951 and in 1952, the petitioner had marched in and have participated with his union in the May Day Parade celebrations in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.746" offset="3798392">Its witnesses, the prosecutions witnesses had left the Party before 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.366" offset="3832874">And before 1952, the ones who testified to this were Manning Johnson who had left in 1940 and John Lautner who had -- who had the last -- had any connection with May Day in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.145" offset="3883969">And they said that it was their opinion that the Communist Party controlled May Day in 1951 and 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.220" offset="3924302">And it was their further opinion that the Communist Party would not have permitted the petitioner Gold to participate in these parades if he had in fact broken with it and left it.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.450" offset="3973204">The uncontradicted evidence in this record is that since 1907, which is long before Gold was a member of the union, long before the Communist Party was formed in this country, the fur union had been annually participating in the May Day celebration and the New York locals of the fur union, the collective bargaining agreements of the New York locals provide that May Day is a holiday.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.699" offset="4102144">This was the Government's evidence and what it boils down to is the fact that the petitioner had been a long time member of the Communist Party, that there was opinion evidence why its experts -- that his resignation was insincere because the Party didn't accept resignation and because no one (Inaudible) was demonstrated between Gold and the Party after the resignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.089" offset="4203708">More testimony that the Party frequently used deceitful practices and the opinion of the experts that the resignation meant the opposite of what it said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.267" offset="4256475">Now, the first legal question, which I would like to discuss, concerns the applicability of the perjury rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.353" offset="4288763">Subject to a few inapplicable exceptions, perjury rule requires that the falsity of a sworn statement must be proved by the direct, that is the eye witness, testimony of two witnesses or one witness plus one independent corroboration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.929" offset="4383117">The question about the perjury rule arises in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.180" offset="4400044">First as Judge Bazelon pointed out, the Government's evidence is circumstantial, weak circumstantial evidence as this, and does not meet the requirement of the perjury rule so that there should have been a judgment of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.861" offset="4470784">I do not believe that the Government will contend that its evidence meets the requirements of the perjury rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1512.099" offset="6151816">The Government says that since prosecutions are frequently brought under 1001 for a false unsworn statements, therefore, the -- the perjury rule does not apply to 1001 prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.958" offset="6211166">But in this case, Congress by Section 9 (h) required that the statement be sworn.It required that the representation be in affidavit form.</text>

            <text syncTime="1595.856" offset="6486810">It was a case which involved the false custom's declaration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.741" offset="6502379">And in that case and in the context of that case the perjury rule was written, of course there were cases -- other cases where the representation is under oath and not in a judicial proceeding where perjury -- the perjury rule apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.720" offset="6574268">Now, the -- the argument and I think it's the only argument which the Government -- upon which the Government relies in support of its contention that the perjury rule doesn't apply is the fact that Congress in 9 (h) provided that prosecutions for a false affidavit should be under Section 1001.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.470" offset="6681266">But there is nothing in the legislative history to show that Congress in designing such prosecutions under 1001 intended thereby to repeal the perjury rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.405" offset="6729017">And that is Judge Bazelon that pointed out, it may -- a more likely assumption is that at the time of the enactment, 1001 contains different penalty for a false swearing into the perjury rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.252" offset="6788368">And a more -- another plausible explanation is the fact that Congress would have thought -- might have thought that neither draftsmanship to lay all prosecutions for misuse of the 9 (h) affidavit and this includes the filing or the using of the false affidavit even though not made by the affiant under one statute, 1001.</text>

            <text syncTime="1701.059" offset="6907591">At that time it was and I -- and I think its quite unreasonable to infer that when the Congress provided a more severe penalty for one kind of perjury than it provided for another, that it intended thereby to repeal the safeguard -- the ancient safeguards of the perjury rule without at least saying something about it and without at least saying that that was its intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.934" offset="7019081">Now, the Government argues further that the perjury rule cannot be applied because the issue in this case is whether the petitioner's resignation was sincere or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.764" offset="7066415">But petitioner wasn't indicted for an insincere resignation, he was indicted for falsely swearing that he was not a member of the Communist Party and that he did not support an organization which taught violent overthrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.473" offset="7125243">Insincerity of the resignation may be part of the Government's theory of the case but it is not the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.576" offset="7161710">And the existence of the resignation cannot change the minimum requirements of proof which are needed to establish membership and support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.430" offset="7205073">We submit that it is precisely in Section 9 (h) cases that the perjury rule safeguards are most vital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.325" offset="7244675">Experience has shown that accusations of Communist membership and support are a prevalent phenomenon, and that the Government witnesses in this field are often highly unreliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.599" offset="7305801">This is dramatized in this case and on this record by the fact that the Government's main witness in this case was Manning Johnson, who testified that he had lied, who admitted that he had lied under oath and that he would lie under oath a thousand times if he thought that that was necessary to observe his commitments to the FBI In the Communist Party case, this Court held that the record was tainted by -- by the allegations that Manning Johnson had perjuriously accused Ralph Bunche of having been a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.635" offset="7465880">This Court remanded the -- the Communist Party case to the Board, but the Department of Justice prefer to have Johnson's testimony stricken rather than to defend it against the allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.919" offset="7519065">In this case, we invited the Solicitor General to inform the Court as to whether or not it had evidence that Manning Johnson was a perjurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.179" offset="7560129">The Solicitor General refuses, however, to say whether or not the Department has evidence that Johnson has committed perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.472" offset="7597223">So we have a situation here where the Government refuses to vouch for the credibility of one of its main witnesses for the reason in publicly accused of perjury and at the same time argues that the safeguards -- the traditional safeguards for one accused of false swearing should be discarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.851" offset="7694817">We contend further that even without reference to the perjury rule, the evidence was -- is insufficient to sustain this conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.449" offset="7733164">The Government's case consists of membership, as I have said, before August 24, 1950, plus the opinion evidence which impugns the sincerity of the resignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.815" offset="7782588">Even if this opinion evidence prove that the resignation was insincere, it does not prove post affidavit membership or support.Proof of that insincere resignation proves only that the petitioner was a member on the day he resigned and during the period before he resigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.484" offset="7889272">But it does not prove membership after August 29, 1950.</text>

            <text syncTime="2317.003" offset="9371355">The second good part of this evidence had nothing to do with even the third count, because it related to matters and periods which were remote from -- from August 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.492" offset="9425377">And even if they weren't remote, there was such testimony, for example, that in 1926 he had participated in the bidding of a striker, of a (Inaudible) and of an employer, and that had nothing whatever to do with even the third count.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.856" offset="9486817">The opinion testimony of the ex-Communist witnesses was also irrelevant and calculated to confuse the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.626" offset="9525896">The Government now concedes that any party policy against resignation couldn't bar petitioner from resigning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.856" offset="9558810">That if the Communist Party had a can't resign rule, that wouldn't have prevented the resignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.830" offset="9586709">In fact if a member can't resign then 9 (h) would be a bill of attainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.209" offset="9608234">Nevertheless, the prosecutor promoted a conviction by -- are they impermissible?</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.981" offset="9627251">And even the unconstitutional argument by telling the jury time and time again that the petitioner could not resign because of the can't resign rule, that he couldn't resign anymore than soldiers can resign from the United States Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.254" offset="9692348">And the trial court refused to correct this argument by instructing the jury that the can't resign rule -- by refusing to instruct the jury that the can't resign rule didn't bar a resignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.939" offset="9759117">One testimony, the testimony of the so-called expert that the petitioner's resignation statement meant the opposite of what it says was likewise inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.984" offset="9823274">These witnesses weren't qualified as experts on the defendant's use of language even if they -- assuming that they were experts on the Party use of language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.858" offset="9862771">And they could no more -- they couldn't say that the defendant, inviting as he did, meant thereby to say as they testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.713" offset="9894222">What he is saying here -- what he means here they said is that I am a Communist and I will always remain a Communist, and that testimony was -- was admitted over objection.I want to pass over various other points in order to deal with the error in refusing to mistrial because of an FBI agent's tampering with the jury during the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.255" offset="9992443">In March 1954, while the trial of this case was in progress, the United States Attorney's office in the district asked the FBI to investigate whether perspective jurors on the master jury list had been receiving literature pertaining to the case of one Hugh Bryson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.744" offset="10090350">Bryson was then under indictment, for a false 9 (h) affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.320" offset="10116681">Bryson's case had nothing whatever to do with Gold's case and Gold had no connection with any literature on Bryson's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.667" offset="10150013">Unfortunately, no one told the FBI to stay away from seating jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.884" offset="10178957">At 9:30 o'clock in the evening, an FBI agent named Smazel called juror Morton, a government employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.903" offset="10230993">According to Morton and obviously, the important thing is the impression the jurors got as to what Smazel said, not Smazel's version of what he said he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.842" offset="10282715">According to Morton, Smazel identified himself as being from the FBI, he said he knew Morton was on the jury panel, told them that somebody had tried to get next to the jurors by sending propaganda literature to their homes and asked Morton whether he had gotten any.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.348" offset="10360769">That same night, the FBI agent called the home of juror Abrams, Abrams wasn't home so he spoke to Mrs. Abrams.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.177" offset="10404028">When Abrams got home close to midnight, his wife told him that the FBI had called to find out whether he had received any Communist literature.</text>

            <text syncTime="3809.243" offset="15340335">Now, it's obvious from reading Mr. Rover's letter to the Bureau that he was not requesting the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate sitting jurors in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.805" offset="15394565">He did ask that an investigation be conducted to see whether or not, in -- in substance, there was and had been an attempt to obstruct justice in an indictment in a case that was pending in his Court that didn't involve Gold in one way, shape, or form.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.791" offset="15466559">Now, if Your Honors please, the FBI agent did go out and investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.354" offset="15492786">And during the course of his investigation, he went to the Jury Commission's Office and he there obtained a list of the January and February panel of the jurors in our court, that is the United States District Court for District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3864.854" offset="15562794">The petit panel sits for one month from the first Tuesday of the month until the first Monday of the following month.</text>
            <text syncTime="3871.488" offset="15589334">The Gold case started on February the 23rd, a Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.438" offset="15605112">It didn't end up until April, if the Court please, so that on unbeknownst to the agent who was doing the investigation when he called juror Abram's wife and when he called juror Morton on the telephone and when he went to see Juror (Inaudible) wife, the agent did not know that they were active jurors in the Gold case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3900.581" offset="15705736">The reason being that the February panel had completed its work on the first Monday of March and except for the -- the Gold jurors who were still sitting in March on the Gold case which it carried over due to the volume of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3916.149" offset="15768012">And it's clear from the record that that incident, namely, the fact that the agent did unknowingly contact the jurors in question, three.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.507" offset="15817435">One of them on the phone, the wives of two of the others, and -- and Mr. Abrams, whose wife had been contacted, later came in person the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3939.492" offset="15861321">It's clear that the agent was called before Judge McLaughlin and that the agent told the judge and was cross-examination if -- cross-examined, if the Court please, by defense counsel in the judge's chambers as to the nature of the content.</text>
            <text syncTime="3955.602" offset="15925791">And the agent said, I told them that I was inquiring whether they had received literature in the Bryson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3962.556" offset="15953586">I didn't say anything about Gold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.194" offset="15964139">If that is apparent from the hearing before Judge McLaughlin which took all day long from early morning, and that is I should say from 10 o'clock until my recollection is about 4:30 in the afternoon with time out for lunch, it's apparent that the -- that the affair was called to the attention of the Government by the FBI when Abrams, the juror -- one of the juror's wife had been contacted, came to the FBI office the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3999.854" offset="16102797">And as soon as he came down, he talked with another agent who was one of the receiving agents there and he said, “Someone called up my house last night and asked my wife some questions as to whether I received Communist literature.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.671" offset="16158072">The agent said -- and then Mr. Abrams said, “I'm sitting on the Gold case”.</text>

            <text syncTime="4032.576" offset="16233723">When Mr. Abram's came down the morning of the day after his wife had been called by Agent Smazel, he talked with a second agent at the Washington field office.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.863" offset="16266846">And he came down there (Inaudible) burden of the testimony in that point which is in the record is that at first he wasn't going to do anything about it, he thought it was joke or an impersonator, but he came down.</text>
            <text syncTime="4055.499" offset="16325360">When the Federal Bureau of Investigation learned through Abrams that there had been this contact of Abrams by Agent Smazel, Agent Smazel went to see Abrams at his place of employment in the Washington Post, Saturday morning, March the 20th, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="4077.092" offset="16411773">And Agent Smazel told Abrams, “I'm interested only in the Hugh Bryson advertisement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.338" offset="16436746">Here it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.980" offset="16443329">I didn't know you were sitting on the Gold case, I'm not investigating you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4090.144" offset="16463914">Thereafter, on that Saturday, it was immediately called to the attention of the United States Attorney's Office, I myself happened to be in New York on the Gold case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4101.497" offset="16509367">The United States Attorney immediately went into action, this was a Saturday, if Your Honors will recall as I stated and the record so shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="4109.608" offset="16541759">The United States Attorney immediately went into action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4113.312" offset="16556596">When I came home that evening, I was surprised of the matter for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.715" offset="16578226">I thereupon held a conference as the record will indicate because I made my statement during the course of the hearing before Judge McLaughlin all day.</text>
            <text syncTime="4127.555" offset="16613543">I held a conference in the Department of Justice and called the FBI agent there and several of the attorneys in the Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="4135.750" offset="16646353">I have the list of the jurors sitting in the Gold case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.421" offset="16661086">I make it a business to keep those jurors in my mind when I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="4144.542" offset="16681566">So the thought occurred to me when the agent explained to me that he didn't know that there were any February jurors still on there, that he might have not only contacted the wife of Abrams but that he might have contacted someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.015" offset="16731408">So I said, all right, I'll name -- I'll read these names, if you contacted anyone else, I want to know about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4164.389" offset="16760978">And on reading the names, I found that the agent unknowingly, obviously, that he was contacting anyone sitting in the Gold case, had contacted on the phone juror Morton and had contacted the wife of Juror (Inaudible), gone over there -- he'd gone over in the morning of Friday, the 19th day of March and talked to Juror (Inaudible) wife.</text>

            <text syncTime="4308.986" offset="17339329">There was no request that this be held in open court and from 10 o'clock in the morning until about 4:30 in the afternoon, if my recollection serves me correctly and the volume of the records will bear me out in volumes 4 and 5, Judge McLaughlin heard from Mr. Leo Rover, Judge Rover, the United States Attorney who gave his statement as to how the matter had been brought to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4339.231" offset="17460328">A Mr. (Inaudible), who was an attorney working on the Bryson case, Agent Smazel, who was the agent who made the contact, Agent Smazel who was the agent on that Saturday morning of March the 20th to whom Abrams came in person down at the -- at the local FBI office.</text>
            <text syncTime="4359.144" offset="17539950">Up to that point, there was ample opportunity and the defense wasn't asked to post questions, asked to cross-examine and they did.At that point, Judge McLaughlin with the first Remmer decision before him and that's adverted to in the record, said, “I do not find from these facts as adduced here that this was a contact with a juror about a matter pending before the jury, nor was it an investigation of the conduct of the juror.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4393.535" offset="17677563">Now, understand me why, Your Honors, that is before any jurors are called in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4399.540" offset="17701491">At that point or shortly thereafter, Judge McLaughlin on the suggestion of government counsel and the record will bear me out with full concurrence of the petitioner Gold's counsel to this extent said that he would call in the three jurors (Inaudible), Morton and Abrams.</text>
            <text syncTime="4428.665" offset="17817997">Petitioner's counsel wanted him to call him in and question him, but they didn't want the trial judge to ask the jurors what their reactions to the contact was.</text>

            <text syncTime="4471.567" offset="17989674">And this Court sent the case back in order that the trial court might inquire into the impact of any contact on the juror's mind.And that's what Judge McLaughlin did.</text>
