            <text syncTime="22.668" offset="194017">The petitioner in this case was indicted and convicted of willfully and knowingly attempting to evade a large part of his income tax with violation of section 145 (b) of the Internal Revenue Code for the years 1946, 1947 and 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.332" offset="280743">The trial court imposed a sentence of two years on each count, which would run concurrently and a $2000 fine on each count or a total of $6000.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.699" offset="330167">On appeal to the Seventh Circuit, the Court of Appeals reversed this to the first count for insufficient evidence and sustained as to the remaining two counts for the years 1947 and 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.554" offset="385546">A petition for rehearing was filed which was denied wherein in that petition for the first there was raised the question of the overlap of Sections 145 (b) and Section 3616(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.497" offset="453360">A petition for certiorari was denied on November 19, 1956 and later withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.345" offset="480737">Subsequent to the denial of petition for certiorari, the case was brought back to the District Court for resentencing under the mandate of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.319" offset="516681">At that time, a further motion was filed for correction and reduction of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.526" offset="537475">The substantial -- filed the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.846" offset="542804">It was based upon the overlap of section 3616 (a) and 145 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="116.082" offset="567672">The Court denied the motion with respect to the overlap but reduced the sentence to one year on each of the remaining counts to run concurrently and fixed the fine of $1000 on each count to be accumulated or a total of $2000.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.393" offset="624933">The matter was brought before the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit and while there, the Court -- this Court was dually -- one on the denial of certiorari and both cases are now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.563" offset="681671">The contention which we make in this case is that an attempt to evade taxes within the meaning of Section 145 (b) is the same and identical thence provide in Section 3616 (a) to file a false and fraudulent return with intent to defeat and evade the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.761" offset="770382">The indictment which was filed against the petitioner in this case alleged that he willfully and knowingly attempted to defeat and he attempted to avoid the -- and evade the payment tax by the filing of a false and fraudulent return.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.317" offset="824613">I think the Government admits the identity of the offenses when it states at page 33 of its brief, the following, "In the instant case as in Berra versus United States 351 U.S.131 and indeed almost every case prosecuted under section 145 (b), the proof that the defendant willfully attempted to evade taxes by filing a false return is identical without that required to prove that he filed a false return with intent to evade tax in violation of section 3616 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="215.910" offset="967032">The consequences of that assumption, I've set forth in the -- the main brief, which we filed in this clause to the effect that there is an identity of the offenses and there cannot be a dual offense or double conviction for a misdemeanor and for the penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.978" offset="1047280">The Government, approximately one week before we are about to file our brief in this case, the time fixed by this Court, made a completely, new position, took a completely new position with respect to section 3616 (a) to the effect that section – that that section did not apply to income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.247" offset="1136410">That change of position, I'd like to devote a few minutes to because it seems to me to be quite important with respect to the history of this litigation and of the statutes involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.717" offset="1178206">When this Costello case was before this Court and which it is at this term, the Government admitted that Section 3616 (a) applied to income taxes and stated as a matter fact that it put clearly and therefore it applied to income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.988" offset="1247274">The Government in the Dillon case in the Eighth Circuit had argued that 3616 (a) did not applied to income taxes and was successful in securing a ruling by the Eighth Circuit to the effect that 3616 (a) did not apply to income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.171" offset="1360018">The Government in its -- our -- our position to -- position for certiorari in that case disavowed holding of the Eighth Circuit and said that 3616 (a) did apply to income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.977" offset="1407248">As a matter of fact, it prepared an appendix to a brief in the later cases, one of which was (Inaudible) case which is also pending before this Court, in which it prepared an appendix to that brief and which was send around to the various District Attorneys throughout the United States to be used in what we call boilerplate in cases, the -- involving the same subject.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.373" offset="1700864">As a matter of fact the -- the Eighth Circuit in the Dillon case also stated that Section 7207 of the 1954 Code which is the counterpart of Section 3616 (a) of the 1939 Code applied to income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.007" offset="1783411">The Court -- or failed in that case to take Congress into the fact that two reports that Congress, the Senate and The House with respect to the 1954 Code specifically stated that the Section 7207 was not intended to make any change in existing law.</text>

            <text syncTime="659.564" offset="2741582">And the District Attorney opposed probation on the ground that he had filed a false and fraudulent return in violation of Section 3616 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="672.691" offset="2794141">The position we take with respect to that is that it seems to me that the Government at this late stage, approximately a week prior to the filing of our return, with this change of position feels and must feel that unless they are successful with respect to that contention, they have lost this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.709" offset="2898213">I'd like to advert now directly to the history of Section 3616 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="704.932" offset="2923081">But I think it's -- the crux of this whole case and I think the Government has pitched its own case on that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.618" offset="2957876">Certainly, that Congress itself in our brief history of the matter is set forth at page 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.070" offset="2991626">The Congress it's -- of our reply brief, that Congress itself as stated in the 1954 Code that the derivation of Section 3616 (a) or -- or Section 7207 of the 1954 Code is Section 3616 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="736.439" offset="3049096">In the 1939 Code, that Congress has stated that the derivation of Section 3616 (a) is Section 3179 of Revised Statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.173" offset="3092041">The two reports of the House and the Senate, which I adverted to you before, both specifically state that the 1954 Code with respect to Section 7207 did not change the existing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.740" offset="3166333">Now, the question is then I think to back and see the antecedence of Section 3616.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.033" offset="3203532">3616 had its derivation in Revised Statutes of Section 3179 which first appeared in Revised Statutes of 1874.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.614" offset="3265808">The predecessor of that section was the Act of 1798 as shown by the materials which were submitted by the Government and which applied -- there was, of course, no income tax at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.405" offset="3320978">In 1861 and 1862, there was an income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.350" offset="3332786">And the Government admits that section -- that the predecessor of Section 3179 applied to the income tax provisions of the Act of 1861 and 1864.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.843" offset="3390777">In 1864, Congress passed a supplement to the revenue laws, which contained certain administrative provisions, one of which was Section 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.729" offset="3438320">Section 15 later became Section 3179 of Revised Statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.590" offset="3461726">It reads as follows, "Whenever any person delivers or discloses to the collector or deputy any false and fraudulent list, return account or statement with intent to defeat or evade evaluation, enumeration or assessment intended to be made or being dully summoned to appear to testify or to appear and produce such books as aforesaid, neglects and so forth shall be fined not exceeding $1000 or imprisoned -- or imprisoned not exceeding one year.”</text>
            <text syncTime="875.323" offset="3604668">The Government urges that that provision was superseded by later legislation with respect to income taxes and relies upon the Act of 1898 as it started.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.859" offset="3650853">It states that the Act of 1898 marked the resumption of a congressional policy, which was in -- though not in effect in 1874 had been followed ever since of incorporating, under each Revenue Act, specific criminal penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.155" offset="3715950">Now, it relies on the Act of 1898, which provided that if any manufacturer shall make any false or untrue declaration, such person shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.300" offset="3760567">Now, it seems to me quite obvious that that provision could not apply to the exclusion of Section 3179 because it did not require a proof of an intent to evade tax which was one of the requirements of Section 3179.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.293" offset="3828590">The -- there is therefore, a different case -- a different proof required under the 1898 Act as compared with Section 3179.</text>

            <text syncTime="1017.492" offset="4173302">They did apply to income tax cases when there were income tax laws in effect but they had taken the position that when Congress was about the specific criminal penalties and later legislation, they did so to the exclusion of Section 3179.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.678" offset="4226069">And they start with this 1898 Act as indicating that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.037" offset="4239548">And as I just pointed out the 1898 Act was a much narrower Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.769" offset="4258461">It provided a smaller penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.550" offset="4265566">It didn't have the qualification of intent to evade which was in the -- in the 3179 provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.680" offset="4290121">Nor did it have the later -- the other requirement in the section 3179 which was that any person summoned to testify or to produce books shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.937" offset="4331081">That was not in the 1898 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.468" offset="4337246">So, obviously in my opinion the both were -- were supplementary to each.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.510" offset="4357413">They complimented each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.684" offset="4366085">Then the Government proceeds to say that the 1909 Act set a pattern with respect to the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.597" offset="4389804">The 1909 Act was, of course, not an income tax but a tax, an excise tax on the corporations by measured by income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.224" offset="4452289">And that tax also was very limited, that specific criminal provisioning -- provision which was contained in paragraph 8 of the Act of 1909 provided that any person authorized by law to make, render, sign or verify any return who makes any false and fraudulent return or statement with intent to evade or defeat the tax imposed shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.842" offset="4550719">Well there again, there was very limited scope to section -- paragraph 8 of the Act of 1909 in that it applied only to persons who were required to render, sign or verify the return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.964" offset="4591261">Whereas that Section 3179 applied to anyone who was required -- who -- who -- disclosed or delivered a return to the collector.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.408" offset="4625011">It also applied as I've just mentioned, to anyone who supplied -- who were refused to produce books or to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.399" offset="4656985">That issue was not covered by the Act of 1909.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.065" offset="4667643">And therefore again, both Acts could exist together and apply to the income tax proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.749" offset="4694392">The Government says then that there were no specific legislation thereafter which indicated that the -- the Section 3179 applied to income tax proceedings because thereafter, commerce legislated specifically on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.797" offset="4786552">However, that is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.858" offset="4794807">Actually, there were only two Revenue Acts between 1909 and 1928, which specifically dealt with income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.101" offset="4831796">That was -- the very first one was the Revenue Act of 1913.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.818" offset="4850604">Now, that Act too is very limited in scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.533" offset="4885504">I like to refer the language of that which appears at page 17 of our main brief, which begins that if any person liable to make the return or pay the tax shall neglect to refuse and any person required by law to make, render and sign which is the same language which was contained in the 1909 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.234" offset="4972335">And again, was limited to persons who were required to file a return and didn't apply, for instance, to an accountant who would deliver a list or a statement to the collector or the director which would prove to be fraudulent or false.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.314" offset="5028655">So that again, Section 3179 would equally apply to a criminal undertaking on the part of a taxpayer or a representative of the taxpayer under the 1913 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.114" offset="5091871">Then to the 1913 Act, it didn't contain the language, which was contained in Section 3179 relating to the production of books or the testifying before an internal revenue agent or representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.959" offset="5147251">The Government then says that the Revenue Act of 1918 is an evidence of Congress intending that its specific criminal provisions shall be applied exclusively to income tax proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.594" offset="5201795">There again, we have a very limited provision in the -- in the criminal provisions of the Revenue Act of 1918.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.338" offset="5232724">The Revenue Act of 1918 provided that anyone who attempts to evade or defeat the tax imposed by that chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.672" offset="5298030">They added the words "in any manner."</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.256" offset="5308374">In other words, anyone who attempts in any manner to defeat or evade the tax shall be guilty for a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.187" offset="5336168">But there again, the use of the words "in any manner," would not enlarge the meaning of the Act because the Congress is not required to set forth the details of -- of the manner in which an evasion shall take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.702" offset="5390190">So that the Revenue Act of 1917 which dealt with the same subject but which left out the words in any manner would have the same scope with the 1918 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.981" offset="5431254">The Congress it seems to me decided in 1918 to punish attempts as such which are to distinguished from the merely -- from the mere filing of a false and fraudulent return which was still a misdemeanor under Section 3179 which provided however, only $1000 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.685" offset="5546088">In other words, in the Revenue Act 1918, Congress decided to make the penalty for attempts a more serious offense and made the punishment $10,000 but still provided it would be a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.585" offset="5597706">I think the distinction between an attempt to evade tax is to be -- is -- is -- is to -- it's very important in this case because in the -- those cases in which the Government has relied upon the attempts provision of Section 145 (b) and possibly this section in 1918 Act, it has always delineated the attempts which the taxpayer has -- is carrying out for the purpose of evading his tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.369" offset="5708884">For instance, he has concealed assets.He has made false entries in his books.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.476" offset="5729259">He has given false testimony to a revenue agent or he has withheld transactions from his records or in any of the variety of ways depending upon the genius of a taxpayer to attempt to evade the tax as distinguished from filing a return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.188" offset="5792162">In those cases, in 1918, the Congress said, “Where you attempt to do these things, commit this affirmative acts, we will make the punishment $10,000 and still keep so to speak, Section 3179 and apply to the filing of a false and fraudulent return”, would intend to evade the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.720" offset="5874291">Congress apparently believing that the two sections did coexist, if the Section 3179 were applied to what the Government later called “minor cases” because the Government has admitted in this case, that they have prosecuted for over five years individuals under Section 3616 for "minor" cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.292" offset="5960495">Now, this would still even attack the Revenue Act of -- even attack Section 3179.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.795" offset="6010546">I also want to point out that in all of these cases where the Congress was enacting legislation, it was also amending the Revised Statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.985" offset="6051297">And that it was amending Revised Statutes, which were right alongside of Section 3179 but never at anytime amended Section 3179 or indicated that it was refilling Section 3179.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.590" offset="6105736">Then comes along the 1924 Act which reverted it to the language of the 1917 Act and apply to attempts to evade tax and referred it to two or three accounts and made it a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.154" offset="6159966">However, that Act did not apply to income taxes alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.382" offset="6172923">It applied to all forms of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.941" offset="6183163">And I'd like to call the Court's attention to the language which appeared in the Government's brief at page 26 on what -- where it makes reference to the 1924 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.315" offset="6240632">And states in the income tax field, the provision first appearing in the 1924 Act, that "Any person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this chapter or the payment, thereof, shall be guilty of a felony."</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.309" offset="6296639">Now, the word "chapter" does not appear in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.906" offset="6306983">The word actually is "Act".</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.304" offset="6312626">So that should read any tax imposed by this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.278" offset="6324433">Then counsel went on in its brief to quote, from the late Justice Jackson concerning that section being the capstone of our system of sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.872" offset="6366856">I think the reference there is -- is erroneous because in the 1924 Act -- the 1924 or the penal provisions did not relate only to income tax but to all forms of tax.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles K. Rice</label>
            <text syncTime="1682.162" offset="6832044">If there is anything that has distinguished the tax collection system in the United States from that in foreign, in any foreign countries is the seriousness of which the criminal sanctions imposed in the United States have been viewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.403" offset="6913024">This Court in the Spies case has referred to the felony sanctions as the capstone of a system designed to meet every offense against the revenue laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.241" offset="6964328">And we think that the system was deliberately intended to impose felony sanctions as evidenced by the eight successive Acts of Congress culminating in the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.617" offset="7041860">Now, I would like to say a few words, at the outset as to the practice within the Department of Justice with respect to the application of Section 3616.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.798" offset="7094523">That section as far as income tax is concerned, of laying -- laid in a disregarded form for many years and had not been applied as a matter of policy with respect to income tax prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.131" offset="7171845">There had been an occasional reference to what does in the Koppelman case in 1945 in connection with whether or not a man had violated the terms of his probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.037" offset="7223568">But as far as prosecution policy is concerned, the department had not authorized prosecutions under Section 3616 at anytime prior to the middle part of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.598" offset="7281768">And the reason for it -- that it did that at that time was this, in the post war period with the great increase in tax rates and the great number of great increase in the number of taxpayers, it was obvious that the great bulk of the income was coming and had to come from those who were in the middle-income brackets and the small-income brackets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.372" offset="7384900">And the Internal Revenue service felt that a strict enforcement policy with respect to both the middle-income and low-income brackets was necessary in order to ensure the proper collection of the revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.444" offset="7437145">So, the result was that beginning in the late 1940's and early 1950's, the Department of Justice began to receive, in very substantial numbers, a large number of cases in which against taxpayers, recommending felony prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.357" offset="7512795">In some of these cases, the amount of tax involved was no more than a hundred dollars and the amounts in -- in very substantial of the cases was very small.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.206" offset="7576221">At that time, the Department was proceeding on a -- on the basis of felony prosecutions in all cases and the cases continue to be send out for criminal prosecution although some of them are amounted in tax, no more than a $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.010" offset="7643408">As you could well imagine, the -- the these cases met with considerable resistance on the part of the United States District Courts and on the part of the United States Attorneys in the various districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.875" offset="7698892">There were complaints that the District Courts were being turned into police courts, that we were getting back into the prohibition days and that something had to be done about the flow of these small cases, which was reaching the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.702" offset="7754167">So, casting about in an effort to meet this situation and in an effort to make the punishment fit the offense, recourse was had to Section 3616 (a) of the Code which I said a moment appeared on its face and in general terms to apply to all tax offenses including the income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.944" offset="7863150">So, beginning at that time about 7% of the cases each year was sent out for prosecution under 3616 (a) instead of 145 (b) of the felony provisions.</text>
