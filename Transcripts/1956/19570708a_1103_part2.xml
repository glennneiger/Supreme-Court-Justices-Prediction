            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Robinson, you may proceed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_s_robinson" startTime="12.752" stopTime="945.357">
            <label>Mr. Joseph S. Robinson</label>
            <text syncTime="12.752" offset="154415">Just as this Court recessed, the half hour was about to stay in connection with the so-called 97% of the waivers, but the fact is that even with all those waivers, we have more American soldiers in jail in any other foreign country in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.326" offset="244694">Imagine what we would have there if there were no waivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.994" offset="267368">And in the back of the appendix, the last appendix we have attached to our brief, Your Honors will note a directive that was issued from one of the commands, by one of the commands in the Japanese area, and the substance of it is to the effect that all men must be more than careful in driving their automobiles through the streets of Japan because on to say that you can be held criminally liable in Japan on the base of criminal negligence, even though it wouldn't give rise to civil liability in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.376" offset="416893">And it goes on to say that if you do not want to join the other men in the armed forces in the Japanese jails, we advice that you express sympathy to the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.047" offset="467571">And then, they quote from a decision of one of the Japanese Judges, where he imprisoned one of our men and he said the reason for the imprisonment was because he failed to express sympathy to the family after an unfortunate event.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.531" offset="537475">And so, waiver or no waiver, the fact remains that we have more difficulty with the Japanese nation insofar as putting our men into their jails than any other country in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.229" offset="616260">In addition to that, we have similar contracts or agreements or executive arrangements, whatever we may wish to call them were some 50 odd nations and whether this Court knows it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.542" offset="681566">A good many of them are secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.072" offset="695672">Nobody could see them, no soldier overseas, no what -- with the States in that particular country knows what his rights or liabilities are insofar as jurisdiction is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.864" offset="742797">They are secret even the Senate and the Congress of the United States had difficulty trying to obtain them.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.221" offset="840286">As one Congress lady put it, I really challenged the right of the State Department or the Defense Department to make dealings with Americans which -- to make -- to make arrangements dealing with Americans, which have anything in them or any policy back of it or any desire to conciliate or go around which would serve to prevent those from knowing the exact terms, prevent the American people from knowing the exact terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.679" offset="950105">I cannot understand or accept the necessity of secrecy.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.852" offset="978735">And when the government officials of these hearings will question this that -- that these documents, they used the time-worn phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.457" offset="1013217">They are classified and we can supply no information.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.540" offset="1029517">Now, imagine, a soldier in the United States Army assigned to some far off land and being told that he may be subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign -- of the land which he -- which he stationed without he or his lawyer or anybody else being able to know what secret arrangement the State and War Departments made with the Government wherein he is stationed.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.682" offset="1142053">In the case of the Japanese agreement, it is not secret as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.149" offset="1167966">But how did the Japanese arrangement come about?</text>
            <text syncTime="270.065" offset="1183640">When the NATO Status of Forces contract was submitted to the Senate, and by the way it was submitted to the Senate almost three years after the agreements were made and many Senators questioned why it was being submitted at that time, the Senate, when it ratified, specifically stated that the NATO Status of Forces Agreement shall not be a precedence for similar agreements in any other country.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.452" offset="1317177">That's not the exact language but that's the text of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.429" offset="1329089">And they also reserved, they also made a reservation that in any case where a United States soldier may be -- may be deprived or denied of any constitutional right that he should not be turned over to a foreign government for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.068" offset="1407666">Those were the two mandates which the Senate expressed at the time it ratified or consented to the -- the NATO Status of Forces Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.844" offset="1454791">At least insofar as the NATO countries are concerned, the -- they are the European countries whose system of justice is more nearly akin to ours than some of the Asiatic countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.653" offset="1514036">But the Congress, nevertheless, imposed those two restrictions on any further action insofar as making these agreements with other countries who are concerned but that did not stop the men who were making them.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.422" offset="1569102">They continued to make them, some secret, others exposed with all countries in the world and when they were asked why, they were asked by the congressional committees, "Why did you do this?</text>
            <text syncTime="380.609" offset="1625840">Why did you surrender this jurisdiction?"</text>
            <text syncTime="383.283" offset="1636498">They said, "It was the best we could get."</text>
            <text syncTime="385.962" offset="1647261">And then, they were asked, “Were there any country say that they would not permit us to station our troops in that country in the event we did not surrender the jurisdiction?”</text>
            <text syncTime="398.665" offset="1698043">There was no answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.052" offset="1707551">It was -- it was asked at least 10 or 15 times by a various Congressmen and Senators, as to whether or not any country laid down as a condition to the United States having bases or troops within their area, whether we must surrender jurisdiction over our own men and no country was pointed to as having made that demand on the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.213" offset="1812250">And so, these agreements were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.999" offset="1819355">First, they were wholly unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.873" offset="1830849">Secondly, they violated our -- the international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.970" offset="1847254">And thirdly, they are unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.853" offset="1862823">And before getting into the unconstitutional question, I want to state that these very officials who point to the justice of foreign countries as being excellent in something which our men must endure when they're serving in the armed forces that these very officials reserved immunity to themselves, the soldiers, they said, may submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign country, but we the officials or anybody connected with the NATO organization, and this is not the group that's in the diplomatic status, they said, we for ourselves will not submit to the foreign jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.954" offset="2023215">And I think it would be enlightening to the Court to know the theory on which one group of our -- of our citizens were subjected to foreign jurisdiction and on what theory the other was not subjected.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.881" offset="2106911">And these are questions asked of Mr. Rankin by -- by Congressman (Inaudible) page 352 of the congressional hearing record to which I have referred before.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.313" offset="2168665">Mr. (Inaudible) From the standpoint of Attorney General's Office, couldn't the same range be made with respect to the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.154" offset="2191966">I'm referring to the arrangements made for the NATO employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.496" offset="2209311">Mr. Rankin "Well, it is a different right when you don't have the right of the individual because he is not forwarding the interest of the Government."</text>
            <text syncTime="540.932" offset="2267094">Mr. (Inaudible) -- I'm skipping several questions and answers because they deal generally with the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.855" offset="2282768">Mr. (Inaudible) “But wouldn't you consider the presence of our forces there as furthering also the national interest and wellbeing the same as our diplomatic people?”</text>
            <text syncTime="557.828" offset="2334699">And someone else answered and said, "Yes, I do," but so and so said something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.184" offset="2364061">Then, there were further questions asked to Mr. Rankin as to how these agreements came about and I'll read two or three questions and answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.878" offset="2394885">Mr. Bentley “If I may resume the question with you again, Mr. Rankin, I am still trying to see if we can't get a definite answer to this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.065" offset="2431666">The Bill of Rights and the Constitution does not follow members of the armed forces overseas.”</text>
            <text syncTime="587.689" offset="2454131">Mr. Rankin “That's right.”</text>
            <text syncTime="589.628" offset="2461863">Mr. Bentley “My contention is, sir, that the Military Justice Code and the Uniform Code of Military Justice, likewise does not follow them overseas under the Status of Forces Agreement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="601.065" offset="2507630">Mr. Rankin “It does as much as it does within this country.”</text>
            <text syncTime="607.024" offset="2531453">Mr. Bentley “Let's not make a comparison, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.933" offset="2543156">Let's leave it to the -- let's leave it overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.543" offset="2553501">What would be -- what -- would that be correct?”</text>
            <text syncTime="616.060" offset="2567607">Mr. Rankin “I can't answer that yes or no.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.225" offset="2580250">As long as they are on duty, the code follows them throughout the world.”</text>
            <text syncTime="624.564" offset="2601671">Mr. Bentley “If they are uniformed and not on duty, it does not follow them, would that be correct?”</text>
            <text syncTime="629.309" offset="2620583">“That would be correct.”</text>
            <text syncTime="631.679" offset="2630092">And so, we have testimony given to the effect -- a man in uniform who was not on duty is not subject to our Military Code and we have the statement made in this record that if he is on duty, he is subject to the Military Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.563" offset="2709608">Now, this case, the facts -- in this case, the facts are stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.585" offset="2729671">It was stipulated that Girard was on duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.518" offset="2745448">It was stipulated in the court below that he was in the performance of duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.643" offset="2777945">The code provides that if there was any issue of fact in the habeas corpus proceeding, the petitioner must be produced to give any necessary evidence in order to avoid Girard from being -- being brought to the United States to give evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.934" offset="2851088">They stipulated that whatever was done, the acts, which he committed which gave rise to the offense was committed in the course of official duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.316" offset="2892675">Now, testimony has been given before the Senate, before the Congress that if a man is in the course of the performance of official duty that even under these agreements, assuming for the moment they are valid, he may not be tried by any other Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.720" offset="2970206">Now, to turn to how the Japanese agreements came into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.886" offset="3026944">There was this security.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.135" offset="3031960">First, there was the peace treaty, then there was the security pact.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.034" offset="3047528">The security pact recites in this preempt that in order to protect Japan, not for the benefit of the United States, but in order to -- to protect Japan, the United States would be permitted to retain certain bases and stations, certain of its armed forces there that in connection with the -- I think agreements for the disposition of forces, I have to get the exact language, an administrative agreement would be -- would be entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.533" offset="3177514">An administrative agreement was entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.095" offset="3187754">It dealt with the civic matter of the disposition of forces, facilities, rights and so forth, and in addition, had contained there in the clause that exclusive jurisdiction over our armed forces shall continue to remain within the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.748" offset="3262360">And there was the added clause that in the event, the NATO -- the NATO Status of Forces Treaty should go into effect that the option of Japan, the United States may enter into a similar agreement with Japan or would enter into a similar agreement with Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.361" offset="3324844">The negotiations leading up to this similar agreement, we do not know, but we do know that a so-called protocol was then entered into, which completely reversed the situation as it had been under the administrative agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.313" offset="3388583">The Senators of the United States never was called upon and never had the opportunity of seeing this protocol.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.429" offset="3413138">It was not in existence when they ratified the NATO Status for Forces Agreement with the two reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.862" offset="3442813">And after the protocol was drawn, it still was not sufficient to want the transfer of jurisdiction from one nation to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.408" offset="3485027">And so, another instrument was entered into, called Agreed Views.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.316" offset="3504671">These were the officials in -- in Japan, Japanese officials and the American officials sitting down and agreeing to certain views as to how or as to what the meaning of the protocol was and that wasn't sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.591" offset="3561723">They then had some minutes of the meetings, which they attached to the protocol and said, that is a part of the protocol.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.078" offset="3595682">Followed by that -- thereafter, there was the -- a circular which was issued and all these documents put together, the Government now contends and gave the executive department of this Government the power to strip a man who was in a duty status of the protection of the United States Code -- of the United States Military Code and turn him over to the Japanese Government for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.604" offset="3721801">And it was admitted in a -- a special hearing that was held on the Girard case on June 15th, I think it was of this year before a subcommittee of the Senate, that the power to make the determination as to who would exercise jurisdiction was in Japan and not in us, that the papers were so drawn that while the United States did protest that jurisdiction, this was jurisdiction that was -- went out assuming now that the -- the agreements were valid, that nevertheless the ultimate decision as to where the jurisdiction would lie was in the Japanese Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.267" offset="3880417">And finally, in this particular --</text>

            <text syncTime="945.357" offset="3884805">Do you -- do you dispute that interpretation of the protocol if it is valid?</text>

            <text syncTime="955.035" offset="3923466">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.384" offset="3928900">The United States has taken the position that because of the documents which followed the Agreed Views and the -- you see the protocol was the third step.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.813" offset="3978637">The first step, the -- then -- then came the Agreed Views, which was the agreement between the -- the Government -- the Government representatives agreed to in a roundtable of conference and then the menace of that agreement and they claimed pursuant to those minutes attached to the Agreed Views and then the circular, which was issued thereafter that the power was vested in the Japanese Government alone to make the determinations to whether or not it was an on duty or off duty case.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.978" offset="4095248">And in the brief, there's a reference to the fact that the Turkish Government has taken the same position in -- in another case under a similar arrangement but it did not flow from the protocol as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.201" offset="4140178">The claim is that it flowed from the Agreed Views document, which they say is law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.916" offset="4163062">On what theory, I don't know, but they say that is the law and therefore, abiding on us.</text>

            <text syncTime="1507.988" offset="6135306">The historical background of that enactment will indicate to Your Honors that it -- it was not the intent of the Senate to give unlimited political power or discretion in the President or the executive to transfer any person or to take away the protection of the Military Code from anyone of our men in the armed forces.</text>

            <text syncTime="1645.162" offset="6683982">The Valentine case in which Your Honors are unquestionably familiar, laid down the landmark rule that the executive did not have the power to transfer an individual out of this country and I think in that case, French citizens were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.703" offset="6750229">To the French Government upon the demand of a latter Government accept that an extradition treaty so specifically provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.534" offset="6781471">In that case, the opinion was written by Chief Justice Hughes, my recollection is that the -- the holding is to the effect that even if there were discretionary power vested in the President that unless there was a mandate or a decree of the Congress whereby he was authorized to act that the individual could not be turned over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.169" offset="6884080">In the Valentine case, the individual bought -- brought a petition for habeas corpus and the power of the President to transfer him, even under an extradition treaty was tested, and the individual was sustained, the power was not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.046" offset="6943535">In another case which is referred to in the brief, an alien, a Mexican that came into this country -- I don't recall the exact phrase, but he was here in the present figure that -- decided that he was detrimental to the best interest of the United States, I think he was in Texas, and an order was issued in the name of the President to the commanding officer that that man be held in confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.268" offset="7052413">The argument was and he was acting as Commander in Chief, the same -- advance in this case, he was arguing -- he was acting as Commander in Chief of the armed forces and he can hold anyone in confinement or act as he surfeit with the individual, particularly an enemy in this country or not an enemy, a -- an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.326" offset="7128691">In that case, the District Judge who wrote the opinion stated that it was, well, it had been on the bench a long time and he felt that he was being called upon to perform one of the most difficult duties he had during the period he was on the bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.076" offset="7199640">He nevertheless, directed that the individual would be free holding that even a -- an arrest that the direction of the President would not be binding on the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.956" offset="7239241">That is for the courts to decide whether or not there is any law by which an individual may be held in confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.150" offset="7267976">I -- I see I'm running -- I'm running out of my time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.422" offset="7277066">I want to touch, if Your Honors please, upon the subject matter of what constitutional rights are taken away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.806" offset="7306637">First of all, there's not only the question of -- of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.471" offset="7325236">There is the question of the equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.280" offset="7340492">Let's assume that in this particular case, instead of an individual, a small G.I. like Girard was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.880" offset="7366928">It was an officer of high rank or even our own Commanding General in the Far East Command that he was in the Camp Weir area and in the course of attempting to scare someone from the military post, a -- a trespasser who was there, and by the way, this was a trespass because there was signs there that no -- no foreigners were permitted to come on the area, no -- note after his nozzle -- the bullet come out again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.388" offset="7472880">He accidentally killed someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.300" offset="7488554">To me, it would be the most humiliating sight to imagine that one of -- to imagine one of our high ranking officers be in trial before the civilian courts of a former enemy nation and there is nothing in these agreements that they're valid that would prevent the Japanese Government from making demand that they'd be permitted to try, our general or some high official in -- in the military who happened to be stationed in the area, unless the President of the United States in that case would agree not to waive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.756" offset="7634422">And then, we have a situation where a political decision may deny to a person the equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.415" offset="7656991">In the one case because of the rank, the individual would not be turned over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.547" offset="7673605">In the other case because he is a lowly G.I., he is turned over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.832" offset="7690742">And yet, if -- what the appellant -- what the appellants in this case contend and their exact -- their exact contentions so there'd be no -- no question about any -- any misquotation, they say, “The decision of the United States not to exercise jurisdiction in this case is a discretionary decision of the Executive Branch and the conduct of foreign affairs and the military defense of the United States and as such is a political decision not subject to judicial review.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.205" offset="7832221">We don't think that any individual, any American citizen can be taken outside the pail of the rights that are guaranteed by the Constitution by a political decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.392" offset="7876942">They say it was done hereby a political decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.376" offset="7884884">That's not our words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.897" offset="7890944">Those are the words of the -- of the appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.039" offset="7911528">And when you get to a point where individuals' rights are determined by political decisions of the Executive Branch of Government, I think, we are embarking upon a dangerous road to the destruction of the constitutional rights of all persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.866" offset="7986866">The -- the Constitution as has been said not only by this Court and Mr. Justice Frankfurter doesn't -- as of the opinion is not the opinion of the whole Court, which is true, but by the highest military court in the United States, they had this subject before them, the case I referred to in the brief, where they said constitutional safeguards follow our soldiers wherever they are in any land and they pointed out how impossible it was for a man in our military service to be afforded the same protection in the courts of a foreign country as he -- as he is in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.146" offset="8179963">The Government points to seven rights which they say an individual has when he's on trial on foreign countries being the equivalent of constitutional rights, the right to a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.416" offset="8233044">I think Mr. Justice Nolan -- Senator Nolan commented on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.298" offset="8248613">He said, “Even -- even a Communist can be entitled to that” and he said the right to be -- to -- to have a copy of the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.028" offset="8287483">Well, it is a fact that in one case it's come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.621" offset="8301902">The charges were -- in Japan, the charges that were served upon the man the very day he appeared in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.447" offset="8325204">They then referred to the -- I'll -- I'll give you the seven rights which we'll say the equivalent of all our constitutional safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.646" offset="8385912">They say three witnesses must confront the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.054" offset="8407542">Well, actually in practice, we know so in France, I don't know whether it's so in -- in Japan, but witnesses do not in every case, every criminal case confront the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.652" offset="8453935">A dossier is made up by the magistrate in -- in the court below and it's handed up to the higher judge and the accused is brought in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.973" offset="8499284">The -- in any event, even if he is confronted by the witnesses, what good would it do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.658" offset="8526033">He doesn't know what this man is saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.275" offset="8532511">There were no rules of evidence as we understand that prescribed what he may say then they referred to -- a right a compulsory process but they add, “If the witness is within the jurisdiction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.980" offset="8583293">But what if a man is charged with murder and the witness happens to be one -- one mile all over the borderline?</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.393" offset="8600952">There's no way of getting him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.749" offset="8610356">And under certain part -- under the laws of certain countries and again I don't know whether it's true in Japan or not, you may produce a witness but then you can't make him testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.430" offset="8649122">Here, we have our normal court procedure which requires a witness to testify when you bring him and you may compel him to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.718" offset="8674200">That is not so in all the countries of the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.486" offset="8697292">Then, they say there is the right of legal representation of one's own choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.968" offset="8719235">If an example of what happened in this case, any criteria of the right to which -- in which they were referred to here, a Japanese counsel was appointed for Girard and when he discharged him, he publicly announced that he was not going to be discharged and if he was, the Court will reappoint him anyhow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.149" offset="8795930">That is another right, the appellants point to as being guaranteed this individual insofar as foreign courts are concerned and then he has the right to have an interpreter if he wants it and a right to communicate with his own Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.761" offset="8850369">Those are the seven basic rights to which the appellants referred as the -- as being the -- the same as constitutional safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.929" offset="8891120">And if Your Honors uphold the power of the present act in this case, what is there to stop him from stripping away these rights and saying, "No, we won't give him that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.759" offset="8930408">We'll give him one right when he's in solitary confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.501" offset="8941380">We'll let someone visit him once a year."</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.029" offset="8951515">If the power is there, he may go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.931" offset="8963114">The question here is one of power, what are the limitations upon that power?</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.544" offset="8989550">The Government officials when questioned on this subject matter of these so-called rights that were the substitute -- substitute for our Bill of Rights, they -- they asked this witness if he was an Assistant Secretary of Defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.081" offset="9075649">They asked him the specific -- I'll be in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.665" offset="9134059">Yes, Senator Ferguson asked Mr. Nash who is an Assistant Secretary of Defense and who said that -- in his own testimony, he was one of the top lawyers in connection with these agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.361" offset="9180766">Senator Ferguson “Do you consider the presumption of innocence does not enter into due process?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.214" offset="9200201">Answer “I think that if a man has a chance to prove his own case, to develop his own case and prove his own facts that that would be all, it would be absolute required in elemental justice and equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.834" offset="9254745">Yes, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.065" offset="9263626">Now, there we have the views of an Assistant Secretary of Defense given before the Senate as to what the rights of an individual are before a foreign court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.419" offset="9313050">We take the position that there has been a usurpation of power in connection with the execution of these agreements that the power to make rules and regulations for the Government of the armed forces of this nation vest -- is vested solely in the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.826" offset="9378670">And that the President may not take that -- that right away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.887" offset="9398941">The President and the Senate combined may not take that right away, but those are rights -- that there were rights, which are guaranteed under the Constitution and while it has been said many times, the Constitution does not extend beyond the territory limits of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.017" offset="9467486">It would appear that the more recent opinions of this Court as to the effect that it does follow the individual under certain particular circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.010" offset="9503431">There are cases when it would not, a tourist going to France, of course, or in any other -- to any other country is not protected by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.402" offset="9536972">He is there with his own volition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.508" offset="9545435">One of the government witnesses said that he could see no difference between a tourist going to France and a soldier who is drafted into the armed forces being ordered to go to France that they are both equally subject to the local jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.571" offset="9597680">And then, one question further on it, they were asked, “Well, how about -- how about an offense when a man is on duty?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.778" offset="9626520">And this exact case -- the exact situation was used as an example by one of the witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="4105.069" offset="16523682">And I want to call your attention to paragraph (2) on page 41A.</text>

            <text syncTime="4830.548" offset="19425573">This -- this agreement went beyond the NATO Agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4834.875" offset="19442918">This went to a civilian component.</text>
            <text syncTime="4841.541" offset="19469563">This agreement went to a civilian the components.</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.368" offset="19480848">It -- it gave exclusive jurisdiction to the United States not only to our armed forces but to civilian components and to defendants and the only defendants that excluded were Japanese defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4856.231" offset="19528286">Then, the question that was asked a short time ago about the fact that it said that such jurisdiction may in any case be waived by the United States was included in here, but who is here to say whether or not such jurisdiction may in any case be waived by the United States applied to the soldier and of the -- of this matter or was intended to apply to the much broader group that was encompassed in the group classified as having or which we had exclusive jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4893.680" offset="19678124">In other words, that provision for waiver may well have gone to any -- one of our civilians or one of our soldiers who was injured out on the streets or some place.</text>
            <text syncTime="4904.562" offset="19721592">But in this case, you have to remember, he was a soldier on duty, assigned to guard duty on an area which had been under our exclusive jurisdiction, on an area which we say under international law we -- we retained exclusive jurisdiction who if he didn't carry out his guard duty was subject to courts-martial and who in carrying out his guard duty as stipulated to by the prosecution accidentally injured this woman or killed this woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="4934.455" offset="19841233">Now, how can we possibly turn a soldier who has carried out his duty under the penalty of a criminal prosecution by our own country to turn him over to a foreign country for trial?</text>
            <text syncTime="4947.094" offset="19891702">The answer to it is going to be very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="4949.219" offset="19900270">If one of the members of the State Department turns to a marine guard in the future who is guarding while an angry mob is charging down into one of our embassies and he says to him, ”Shoot them when they come over to threshold.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4961.502" offset="19949380">The marine is going to say, “Here, shoot him yourself mister, I don't want to be tried.”[Laughs].</text>
            <text syncTime="4967.100" offset="19971741">That's going to be the answer and it will destroy the entire morale of our -- of our whole military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4972.928" offset="19995042">If we order this man to do -- to -- to do an act and he does it in the performance of his duty, he is entitled to have our country deterred, whether or not that was the proper performance of his duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4985.742" offset="20046346">And I want to just call one more thing to your attention, the assistant -- one of the Assistant Judge Advocate Generals went to Japan and was asked the question by the newspapers or any court-martial proceedings have been brought against Girard and his answer was that so far there was no indication as to any reason for him being tried by courts-martial and that's the nub of this whole case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5013.924" offset="20159091">Girard was in the performance of his official duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5017.294" offset="20172570">The army decided not to try him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5019.526" offset="20181452">The Japanese set up a clamor to try him because they don't agree with our definition of -- of official duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5025.948" offset="20207156">And so, we are now said -- we are now told, “You must turn Girard over to the Japanese because the Japanese don't -- do not agree with our definition of official duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5037.658" offset="20253968">And if you do this, it will destroy the morale of the armed services of this country probably forever.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5045.626" offset="20285837">Now, that's the -- that's the answer to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5047.178" offset="20292106">It's just that simple and I thank you very much for the -- for the time that I've taken before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="5088.283" offset="20456469">First, I would like to make it very clear the position of the United States Government regarding to the treaty of peace with Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5097.383" offset="20492936">It's on 5A of the Government's brief and in that treaty in Article I, Chapter 1, subparagraph (b), the United States Government and the allied powers recognized the full sovereignty of the Japanese people over Japan and its territorial waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5126.608" offset="20609755">In that Act or in that same Treaty, we agreed that we would withdraw our forces within 90 days, so that we recognize the complete sovereignty of Japan the moment that Treaty was signed and ratified to all of Japan and its territorial waters and we don't claim any impingement upon that agreement whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="5158.555" offset="20737546">Now, we did agree within 90 days, we would withdraw our forces and then we had the Security Treaty, which permitted us to leave forces under the terms of that Treaty order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5172.310" offset="20792613">If we didn't have that Treaty, we wouldn't have been permitted to leave those forces under the terms of that agreement and then, the Administrative Agreement that was made under which provided in greater detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="5189.342" offset="20860740">Next, I'd like to turn to the case, the Canadian case that was referred to and is reported in 4 Dominion Law Reports at page 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="5207.967" offset="20935241">It was a decision by the Supreme Court of Canada in the nature of an advisory opinion, this Court was not rendered, but the Court did not accept the position advocated by the United States in the brief that it tendered to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5228.772" offset="21018415">There was a divided Court and the decision was three to two against the position of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5238.344" offset="21056763">I'd like to just briefly read the syllabi of the Court because it shows the thinking of the Court and if the Court -- if this Court cares to go into it, you will find a number of authorities that the Government deals with and the position that the Canadian Court took and what it relied on, how it examined this entire subject and felt that the whole idea of immunity of foreign force was an imposition or a reduction of the sovereignty in contrary to the idea of control of such matters and prosecution for criminal offenses by the country in which the -- such forces were located.</text>

            <text syncTime="5377.028" offset="21611499">Now, this Court has said in a number of cases that international law is not merely what the writers may say it ought to be, but its not -- and it's what the law is, what you can find from the decisions and also what the practice it is amongst the nations of the world and that's how this Court determines what international law is and it doesn't make any difference on how much you theorize about what immunity you have from the law -- criminal law of another country if you can't persuade that country that that is the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="5438.923" offset="21859035">And they were not willing to extend that to Canada as to the United States and in the concurring opinion of one of the justice of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5451.624" offset="21909817">He said that we're involved in one of their nationals, there is certainly would be no immunity even though they would recognize it as between the United States' own people on the basis, so that was the position that the -- the Court took.</text>
            <text syncTime="5470.825" offset="21986722">Now, both sides have cited louder parts, treaties on Oppenheim's International Law, but we have cited the Eighth Edition in our brief on page 25 and the opposing counsel have cited the Seventh Edition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5492.050" offset="22071568">I don't how it happened that it was handled in this manner by a lot of facts, but if you turn from the place where he recites what is cited by counsel for the respondent, in the Seventh Edition some 48 pages later.</text>
            <text syncTime="5508.886" offset="22138964">In the Eighth Edition, you'll find the following language.</text>
            <text syncTime="5513.086" offset="22155682">However, the view which has the support of the bulk of practice is that in principle, members of visiting forces are subject to a criminal jurisdiction of local courts and that any derogations from that principle require specific agreement of the local state by figure or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="5540.158" offset="22264038">Now, it's generally recognized that the executive has the authority in regard to diplomatic immunity, one of the examples that counsels cited, to waive them that in this clear exchange case that Chief Justice Marshall has discusses the fact that one of the aspects of this problem is the representing of the sovereign, its diplomatic representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="5572.048" offset="22391515">And generally, he is immune from the criminal laws of a country, which he attends, but that is subject to waiver and this Court has held in several cases and in the case -- the Kent case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5587.876" offset="22454836">The United States did waive it and permitted Kent to be tried by the British courts in regard to certain secret documents that they claimed to have been stolen and this, the Court denied his application for consideration of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5606.592" offset="22529755">And in the area of extradition, the Court has recognized the discretion of the State to decide, plan the person charged should be delivered up and it's entirely within the discretion of the executive to make that decision and the Court has so recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="5631.259" offset="22628394">We do have an extradition treaty with Japan that we have had for some 17 years and under all of those principles, which we think are comparable, there would be a discretionary authority in the executive to determine whether or not to act -- for the Government to act or to permit the other country to the same situations dealt with and been recognized by this Court in regard to the Attorney General's power to deliver up a prisoner who is held in a federal penitentiary for state prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5667.610" offset="22773844">And as a matter for his discretion, even though there is no statute concerning, that he can exercise that discretion and deliver the man up so he can be prosecuted under the state offense and that that penalty shall be -- shall follow whatever action he has been -- whatever action has been imposed upon him for the federal offense so that the whole area of this discretionary authority of the State in regard to these problems have been recognized by the Court and applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="5702.282" offset="22912502">Now, there was a question in regard to how many waivers had occurred with Japanese -- with Japan and the character of those waivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5716.026" offset="22967463">The Government was asked if it would supply information to counsel for the respond in regard to this and we made an effort just to see if it could be supplied and we found that the information was not in a form that it could possibly be -- be supplied with any -- any reasonable period of time because it would mean going back to every soldier's file and try to find out any one that had -- any record of being charged and try to find out just what happened in his particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5749.387" offset="23100897">And with 5400 cases within one year, it was quite impossible to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5754.554" offset="23121586">So the best that we can do is refer to the annual report to the Senate Armed Services Committee on the exercise of the criminal jurisdiction over United States service personnel by foreign courts, December 1, 1955 to November 30, 1956 presented by George W. Hickam Jr., Major General of United States Army, the Judge Advocate General, Department of the Army, and this is in a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5781.673" offset="23230046">This isn't in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5783.459" offset="23237256">It was in a hearing report before a subcommittee of the Committee on armed services, United States Senate 85th Congress per session dated April 9th, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="5798.071" offset="23295666">It's got an imprint on it, 91290, maybe of any assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5805.682" offset="23326072">In that -- in regard to Japan, on page 37 with a notation effective since October 28th 1953, the Defense Department describes as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="5823.312" offset="23396603">During the period of this report, there were 5544 cases involving United States personnel subject to the jurisdiction of Japanese Courts, (3013 of these cases were traffic violations).</text>
            <text syncTime="5840.537" offset="23465566">Japan waived its jurisdiction in 5409 or 97.56% of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5848.407" offset="23497017">It tried 111 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5850.925" offset="23507048">These trials resulted in 54 fines only, 42 suspended sentences to confinement and 15 unsuspended sentences to confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5861.892" offset="23550934">There is no further delineation of the character of their offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5885.447" offset="23645184">The only other reference that I care to make is in regard to Article XIV and counsel has stated to the Court that applied as the Uniform Code states in all places.</text>
