            <text syncTime="28.804" offset="218572">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.837" offset="226722">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.795" offset="250546">The case originally arose as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus directed to the warden as a Lewisburg Penitentiary that petition for writ of habeas corpus was brought before the District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.998" offset="311359">On May 7, 1956, the Board -- the Court of Appeals announced its decision refusing to grant the writ of habeas corpus and free the prisoner, and this Court has granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.774" offset="382516">The fact of the case of brief is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.618" offset="393801">Petitioner Jackson and the another soldier, named Fowler, who is the petitioner under case Number 620, together with another soldier named De Coster were brought to trial before a court-martial was convened in Korea on June 8, 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.774" offset="478438">There, they were charged in with two counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.613" offset="493798">First, premeditated murder and second, rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.110" offset="511770">The Court found the defendant, all three of them in a joint trial, guilty of murder and not guilty of rape but guilty of attempted rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.805" offset="558582">Thereupon, the Law Officer of the Court advised the Court that the minimum sentence was life imprisonment and the maximum sentence was death.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.829" offset="602676">We have no quarrel with the fact that the instruction is given to those outside of the directions contained in the manual for court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.351" offset="644786">It is only incidentally of some importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.956" offset="659205">The Court picked the sentence, life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.602" offset="685746">There was no sentence, separate sentence of any kind for the attempted rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.635" offset="713958">It was just the one gross sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.907" offset="727019">Thereafter, the sentence was and the findings of guilty were reviewed by the Commanding General for Korean area, a proper person and they were approved in full sentence and the findings of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.158" offset="792012">And thereafter, a routine vastly came before the Board of Review in the Office of the -- the Judge Advocate General of the Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.614" offset="821791">The Board of Review found that the record failed to show any evidence that the activities that these three soldiers was in any way connected with the death of the woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.395" offset="884903">And thereupon, it held that the murder charge should be set aside, but the attempted rape charged for conviction was sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.884" offset="930879">But instead of setting aside the entire penalty, in ordering a new trial, the Board of Review conceived its authority or its proper function to be that it should make then and there an initial determination of what the sentence should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.701" offset="998170">The opinion as it is written, indicates that that Board of Review felt that it should determine what is an appropriate sentence, but in the order part of the -- of the decision, it says that the sentence -- that so much of the sentence had exceeds 20 years, which is the maximum for attempted rape shall be set aside or take that so much of the life imprisonment sentence as it exceeds 20 years is excessive and shall be set aside and the other 20 years shall be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2464.457" offset="9961200">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.347" offset="9992756">I think I should address myself that the outset to the single sentence or gross sentence practice, which has existed in military law from the very beginning because it is that which has provided the foundation for the controversy that is written here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.766" offset="10098395">No matter the number of chargers or specifications of which an accused is charged, the court-martial in all cases imposes a single sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.050" offset="10167568">Chief Justice Fuller of this Court spoke of this practice more than 50 years ago in one of the leading decisions of this Court relating to a court martial jurisdiction, Carter versus McClaughry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.635" offset="10225873">And there, said, “We understand the rule established by military usage to be, that the sentenced of a court-martial shall be in every case an entirety.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.243" offset="10280312">The Court of Military Appeals much more recently of course is dealt with this same matter and frequently so, and it has stated – I'm quoting from one of its recent opinions, “The concurrent sentence is entirely without president in Military procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.657" offset="10365994">A single inclusive sentence is imposed regardless of the number or character of the offenses of which the accused has been convicted.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.109" offset="10423777">I think I would also like to mention to the Court at the outset that the situation where an accused is convicted of several offenses and the reviewing authorities either modify or set aside one or more of the findings of guilt is obviously a very common one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.914" offset="10543000">I supposed more charge sheets setting out the charges contain a number of offenses, but then, contain a single charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.715" offset="10598275">We have some data as to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.240" offset="10612381">Between 1951, for example when the Uniform Code went into a fact, and 1955, a four-year span, Boards of review which as Your Honors referred operate at the second stage of review in a military system, have modified findings in 2861 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.724" offset="10722304">There was a modification by the Court of Military Appeals during that same period in an additional 357 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.820" offset="10758666">These figures which run for more than 3000 do not include the cases as to which we have no data available, in which those modification of findings or striking of some findings by the convening authority at the first stage of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.049" offset="10835571">I point this out because the consequence of certain of the arguments which have been made by petitioners here today would be that every time in these thousands of cases in which there is a modification of some of the findings, the case would have to go back on the theories which they advanced to the court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.663" offset="10934000">Therefore, the contentions, which they make go I think to the very essence of the structure of the system of review as it exists in the military law system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.024" offset="11003486">Now, in our view, reviewing authorities possess and have traditionally possessed substantial sentencing powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.281" offset="11056462">The court-martial is not the same, as a District Court in the federal system.</text>

            <text syncTime="4293.630" offset="17277889">And I think the question comes squarely down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4298.111" offset="17295862">What did Congress proposed in respect to allocation of sentence powers?</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.579" offset="17337657">We believe that Congress certainly recognize the gross sentence practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4315.538" offset="17365556">It dissolves as military law and the man who, for court-martial indeed, tells the Court that it must return a single sentence, covering all of the offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4327.161" offset="17412054">Now, with that background of this gross or general sentence practice, the question is what did Congress proposed should happen if as would quite commonly occur and has, one or more of the multiple convictions was modified or set aside on review?</text>
            <text syncTime="4348.323" offset="17496691">And we say that in that situation, the Articles contemplate and practical considerations, which where in the minds of Congress strongly support the necessity that the power to fix a specially suited sentence for the convictions as approved be in reviewing authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4372.715" offset="17594284">Now, I think there is no question that in the military law system, Congress could decide that the court martial power shouldn't have anything to do with the sentence at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4383.213" offset="17636185">It could say, “Their function will be specifically finding guilt.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4389.190" offset="17660113">Certainly, it's no novelty and in our jurisprudence to have a separation of the facts finding and the sentencing functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4398.723" offset="17698252">Now, in the court martial system, there is not a complete separation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4403.330" offset="17716642">The court-martial, which acts like the jury in determining the facts, also fixes an initial sentence, which represents for all time thereafter, the maximum sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4416.476" offset="17769305">But we say that it is contemplated that the reviewing authorities, in studying the record and in making modifications for the accused benefit, shall also have the power when they make such modifications for his benefit to make an adjustment of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4437.960" offset="17855195">Quite normally, certainly, the sentence is imposed by the courts-martial in which are constituted quite generally of line officers are much more severe than the sentences as ultimately approved by the reviewing authorities, particularly, as approve by the Board of Review.</text>
            <text syncTime="4454.611" offset="17921860">Now, I'd say since Congress could've taken all sentencing power away from the court-martial, that there is no inequity in establishing a system where when there are modifications of the findings, the reviewing authorities will adjust the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4472.214" offset="17992182">I say there's no inequity because the reviewing authority has limits, in no event, cannot exceed the legal limit for the offense ultimately approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4481.274" offset="18028440">In no event, cannot exceed the engross sentence imposed by the Court.Moreover, the Board of Review is directed to review the entire record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.483" offset="18073266">It can find the facts anew, and it is -- and as an expert body, it is in a position to impose a fair sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="5157.139" offset="20731904">And then, if it -- if the major crime was knocked out, there would be some measurement at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="5165.929" offset="20767117">But -- but when the court-martial must, of necessity, give them all the same sentence, namely, life imprisonment on the murder charge and then when the murder charge is knocked out, have nothing -- nothing at all to be guided by so far as he picked to the court-martial he's concerned on lesser offenses, it seems to me, that's a different situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="5208.757" offset="20938376">Now, that -- it may be true that in that situation where there's a mandatory sentence, the Board of Review will have less guidance in the nature of things than it might have as it were a case not involving a mandatory penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="5475.503" offset="22005426">It is a fairly full brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5481.444" offset="22029145">What we think emerges then from this structure of review there -- are these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5491.799" offset="22070523">In the first place, we think that it must be remembered that the court-martial is essentially like a jury, which is convened for a limited time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5499.881" offset="22102915">It can be convened only for a single case, which has no continuity, no situs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5506.111" offset="22127783">By the time this very case was reviewed by the Board of Reviews on six or seven months after the case had been tried, it's quite probable that you couldn't get a form of the same court, especially in the field would that be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="5522.338" offset="22192776">And I -- I think I say that it's quite uncommon that a court-martial would function as the unit for more than a few weeks or -- or perhaps, a few short months, because officers are constantly being assigned in new duties or to new stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5540.557" offset="22265605">We think further, it appears from an analysis of the structure of the Military Law Review system that Congress has here vested extensive judging powers in reviewing authorities as well as in courts-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5558.860" offset="22338853">These authorities, both at the convening authority level and at the Board of Review level can review the fact as de novo.And Congress has specifically indicated that it has expected that the boards of review would make judgments as the convening authorities also to do since he is to act on the sentence in his discretion, would make judgements as to sentence appropriateness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5585.841" offset="22446686">Now, that indicates to us that the reviewing authorities are not solely agencies of review, though we use that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="5595.699" offset="22486183">They have powers, which partake of the powers of a trial judge in our federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5603.112" offset="22515858">The -- the court-martial has no presiding judge like our District Court does and the court-martial is a very transient body.</text>
            <text syncTime="5613.161" offset="22555982">But the convening authority does have powers like a judge and extensive ones for he cannot only consider the facts, he can decide in his discretion how much of the court-martial sentence to approve.</text>
            <text syncTime="5626.576" offset="22609690">And that, we think, is the key to the question, what is to be the disposition of a case involving multiple convictions in which there are modifications of the findings by the higher authorities.</text>

            <text syncTime="5701.750" offset="22910412">It would have said, “We are remanding the case to the convening authority for a hearing or such other action as he may deem appropriate.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5715.802" offset="22966627">Now, if in that circumstance, the convening authority decided that for one reason or another, the murder charge could not be retried.</text>
            <text syncTime="5725.140" offset="23003930">For example, the unavailability of witnesses, then it would be in his profits since the case had been referred back to him to adjust the sentence in the light of the findings, ultimately sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="5741.029" offset="23067460">In no event, do we think that this system contemplates a reference back to a court-martial for resentencing?</text>
            <text syncTime="5752.769" offset="23114480">The petitioners have pointed out that if the case were to go back, it would have to go to a new court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5763.129" offset="23155858">Now, I -- I think it would be an astonishing suggestion that Congress intended a new court to read a called record and fix inappropriate sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5776.243" offset="23208312">When Congress has created a Board of Review, especially qualified professional body to pass upon matters of sentence appropriateness and has indeed said, “We hope that in giving the boards of review this power, greater uniformity of sentences among the various services will be achieved.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5802.641" offset="23313951">Now, we're saying that the court-martial, once it has expired is hardly the body to commit this matter of resentencing, but this system contemplates that judging power is vested in reviewing authorities shall serve that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="5820.240" offset="23384377">Now, that of course has been the unanimous position of the cases as decided during the brief history of the Court of Military Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5831.832" offset="23430666">I'm not going to attempt to refer to its decisions in the brief time remaining, but it has dealt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5842.808" offset="23474552">The Court of Military Appeals has dealt on numerous occasions with this question of resentencing, and it has said that the change in the quantum of punishment, which is to be made in the lighter -- light of altered findings is to be made by reviewing authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5859.380" offset="23540903">There's only one case and that needs some -- a word of explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5864.545" offset="23561592">Only one case we know of in which a resentencing matter was ever committed back to a court-martial and that was this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5874.325" offset="23600671">An officer had been tried on five charges and found guilty on five.</text>
            <text syncTime="5881.937" offset="23631078">The Board of Review and the Court of Military Appeals determined that certain of the charges were not supported and the end result was that after the Court Military Appeals had finished, only one offense of the five stood intact, only one finding of guilt and that a very minor offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5903.837" offset="23718745">The officer had been sentenced to dismiss it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5907.993" offset="23735359">The Court of Military Appeals said in that case that it did not think that the reviewing authority could make any adjustment, had the power to make any adjustment in the sentence, because a change from dismissal to any other form of punishment is deemed in military law a commutation of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5929.306" offset="23820622">A change to a different type of punishment and a commutation of sentences that power is reserved to the President alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="5939.292" offset="23860537">And the -- and the Court of Military Appeals in that case said that it thought that the officer should be retried under one offense which was found a valid conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="5985.113" offset="24043813">And for these reasons, the court-martial has a duty to impose a proper sentence for all of the offenses of which the accused are found guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5995.847" offset="24086758">The court-martial also is required to impose a single sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6000.798" offset="24106611">Therefore, I say, that when the court-martial, having returned findings of guilt of two offenses, imposes a sentence in gross.</text>
            <text syncTime="6012.249" offset="24152377">It is too conclusively to be presumed as in the case of any general sentence that the sentence imposed covers all of the offenses of which the accused were found guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="6025.149" offset="24203995">Now, I don't think that there's any more reason in this case to suppose that the sentence doesn't cover all of the offenses, merely because it's a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6036.759" offset="24250389">I don't think, as Judge Hastie quoted in his opinion in Number 619 that, “The military is required to adapt any such oddity as giving a sentence of life imprisonment plus a term of years.”</text>

            <text syncTime="6438.142" offset="25855979">One of the cardinal principles, set out in Article 66 is that a Board of Review may affirm all or part of the findings and determine a specially suited sentence from the entire record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6451.697" offset="25910209">That obviously means the record as it stands or as it has been changed by action on the finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6459.770" offset="25942497">I don't think that one could conclude in this case that the Board of Review did not have authority to fix a specially suited sentence in the exercise of its judgment without casting great doubt upon the powers of boards of reviews to adjust sentence in other cases in which there has been an alteration of the findings in the process of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="6486.990" offset="26051375">The Court of Military Appeals expresses itself as believing that if such powers of modification over sentence cannot be exercised by reviewing authorities the whole appellate structure must be redesigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="6500.660" offset="26106023">And this of course rest basically on the fact that you don't have a trial court in the sense that we do within our federal system to consider matters of resentencing.</text>

            <label>Mr. Urban P. Van Susteren</label>
            <text syncTime="6519.716" offset="26182196">First of all, I would like to comment in a good deal of what has been said by opposing counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="6524.777" offset="26202467">It goes away from the absolutely necessary and fundamental concept that this Board of Review has only those powers which are given with by the statute and those which must necessarily be inferred permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6539.647" offset="26261922">Now, what much have what has been said might have some effect upon the matter of interpreting that statute, but otherwise, the Board of Review nor the Court of Military Appeals does not have a -- a system of rules as the common law rules with which it can guide itself and tailor its remedies in its procedures to meet the exigencies of each situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6567.119" offset="26371845">In connection with comments upon the number of appeals that there were to the Board of Review, not only a number of appeals, a number of times that the Board of Review set aside either the findings or the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6579.999" offset="26423359">And in connection with it as being used here to indicate to this Court, the burden upon the military establishment to send those back for a new trial or rehearing, at least we point out, first of all that the law is -- that boards of review or that court-martials will use their own discretion in fixing a penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="6614.979" offset="26563271">I read from the manual for courts-martial, page 121 or 122, down paragraph four, “Courts will, however, exercise their own discretion and will not adjudge sentences known to be excessive in reliance upon the mitigating action of the convening or the higher authority.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6637.548" offset="26653550">Now, I'll take to hear more journals as quoted in the respondent's brief on page 419 of that issue, an article written by the editors of the Yale Law Review quoted in this brief and they comment us, at the top of page 419.</text>
            <text syncTime="6657.001" offset="26731395">The Court fail to -- referring to the Court in Chicago first of all, the Court for the Seventh Circuit in the De Coster case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6664.104" offset="26759816">The Court fails to consider that in practice, courts-martial performed a function nearer to that of the juries in a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6670.359" offset="26784789">And here it is, “Courts-martials are composed of laymen, all though they theoretically can impose whatever sentence they deemed fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6678.870" offset="26818853">In the great majority of single conviction cases, they actually impose the maximum sentence permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="6687.132" offset="26851871">The final sentence is set upon review by the legally trained boards.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6691.331" offset="26868694">Now, if the Army would follow the plain simple letter of the law, and tell the court-martial to adjudge a penalty which is correct and proper in their own mind as the Congress intended to, they wouldn't had he cluttered and clogged up there in the Board of Review, and they would not have the necessity for all of those rehearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="6712.621" offset="26953853">Now, taking up another subject, and that is the question of the basis or reason for the number of changes that have been made and considering it in the light of how frequently rehearings would be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="6730.384" offset="27024906">In this case, we have a situation where the sentence imposed by the court-martial was greater than the maximum permissible for the count that has been held to be good.</text>
            <text syncTime="6746.527" offset="27089481">I would like to take the Court's attention back to the early days of these Court's existence, the case of -- United States versus Clawson cited in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6757.023" offset="27131486">In that case, Clawson and an Army officer had been convicted by a court-martial of a number of offenses of the type of bribery and embezzlement and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="6767.783" offset="27174536">The President was the appointing authority for the Court, so the President reviewed the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6773.083" offset="27195747">The President set aside a number of those convictions, but he did not change the penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="6778.247" offset="27216332">I believe the penalty was five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="6780.607" offset="27225840">On petition for writ of habeas corpus, this Court announced or adopted what we might call the Lord Mansfield Rule, saying that prior to the declaration of independence, it was announced by Lord Mansfield that where there is a general verdict and a general sentence imposed upon a number of counts and it is later found that some of those counts be held not good, it will be presumed that the Court levied the sentence upon the count that was good.</text>
            <text syncTime="6811.277" offset="27348511">Now, that has been adopted, that was the -- the law in this -- in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6815.900" offset="27367006">That was adopted by the Army and the Army has operated under that principle all during these years.</text>
            <text syncTime="6822.368" offset="27392815">So, when the Uniform Code of Military Justice was launched, that -- I wonder when it started.</text>
            <text syncTime="6828.779" offset="27418520">That principle, which has been followed all during those years, we must concede change into light with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6835.223" offset="27444224">It followed along.</text>
            <text syncTime="6836.566" offset="27449657">We cannot argue that that principle is dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="6838.926" offset="27459062">I think it lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="6840.407" offset="27465017">But that principle cannot be extended to a situation like this because here, the Lord Mansfield Rule, the Clawson case reiterated in a number of other cases since that time, by its own words it excludes this type of case, because here, we know that the Court did not levied a sentence on the count that is good because it would have been a maximum of 20 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="6871.775" offset="27590510">Well, we must presume that the Court, were honorable gentlemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="6874.814" offset="27602631">They have been informed by their law officer that the maximum penalty for -- or the minimum penalty for life imprisonment for -- for murder was life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6886.668" offset="27650069">At least -- you see, under the Lord Mansfield Rule, it said, “It will be presumed that the Court levied sentence on the count which has been held good,” unless, there is something in the record to show the contrary, that's it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6901.232" offset="27708270">Now, we know that the court-martial, I presume, we can see from the record that court-martial didn't levy a -- a life imprisonment sentence for the attempted rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="6912.422" offset="27753096">Furthermore, the record does show that the Court had been advised by the law officer that the penalty for murder was life imprisonment and they probably went ahead and put in the life imprisonment.</text>

            <text syncTime="7075.619" offset="28405844">I -- I think I have spelled out that it will not in this Court announce the rule that the Board of Review have no -- no authority or power to do as it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="7083.692" offset="28438131">It will not require the Board of Review to send back all of those cases for rehearing whenever they set aside one, or two, or three, or some of the convictions, because that old rule is still there to permit them to -- to keep the original sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="7105.371" offset="28524857">Now, in his argument, counsel for respondent talks about the -- the elaborate protection which Congress had directed against harsh penalties in showing that the convening authority can reduce and set aside that cannot increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="7123.120" offset="28595806">That, I say, is precisely the mischief involved in what have been done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7129.028" offset="28619525">This Congress intended that a soldier should have all of those protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="7135.735" offset="28646275">Here, the solider has had none.</text>
            <text syncTime="7138.251" offset="28656410">He has no chance for any further review, and I believe counsel has admitted that the finding here in this case was final.</text>
            <text syncTime="7146.552" offset="28689533">There was no other type of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="7152.752" offset="28714402">Then, if we assume that Congress could provide as there was some discussion about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7159.379" offset="28740838">Assuming that Congress did have the authority to provide that the penalty could be fixed ab initio by the Board of Review, nevertheless, I say the important fact is Congress did not do it, and that the Board of Review has no power other than those granted, either by the specific letter of the statute or by necessary inconvenient.</text>
