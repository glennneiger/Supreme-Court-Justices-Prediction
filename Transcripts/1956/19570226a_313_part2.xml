            <label>Mr. William C. Wines</label>
            <text syncTime="4.611" offset="121814">If -- if I -- if I may respond more fully and at least I hope more clearly to Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question, asked immediately before the recess.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.928" offset="171133">As I understood Mr. Justice Frankfurter, he inquired whether I, having stated that the bill is not explicit in either prohibition or permission of strikes and there being no over-deterrence by any of the committees in formal report.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.217" offset="272280">We were therefore remitted to, I believe, His Honors' phrase was "considerations of general policy."</text>
            <text syncTime="51.458" offset="309164">I was forced to answer that question monosyllabically, and I said by the -- the shortness of time, and I said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.287" offset="344482">Actually, what we do rely on is these considerations which might be said to be of general and of -- of policy, that here, there was discussion to which I shall come in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.552" offset="421595">It is the very heart and core of our argument, not on the margin of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.408" offset="469034">The question as to how far if at all the Norris-LaGuardia Act should be repealed only some two years after its enactment and it wasn't lightly enacted, was central.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.825" offset="554715">It was focal.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.104" offset="575822">It was the chief concern of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.439" offset="605080">Now, this -- yet we find that Congress, although, it was keenly aware of the problem, though it was extensively and intensively discussed and argued with major deliberation for a board any explicit prohibition or permission of strikes from which we draw the conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.570" offset="729631">And this is our principal argument that Congress did not intend to prohibit cryptically or surreptitiously strikes when -- or if to prohibit them at least to implement the prohibition by injunction when that was the problem that was being discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.129" offset="851884">Now, in the congressional hearings, and I am reading from -- if I may, Mr. Chief Justice, a few lines because they are right into the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.249" offset="904338">I'm reading from page 4 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.554" offset="933595">Mr. -- Congressman Wolverton is discussing a prohibition about strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.861" offset="966823">He said the Commissioner Eastman -- now, Commissioner Eastman was the draftsman, very largely the draftsman and the architect of this very important measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.720" offset="1014262">And Congressman Wolverton asked the architect of this bill, speaking of a prohibition against strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.902" offset="1050937">Now, the only question I am in doubt about is whether there are -- or not there should be an injunction under this Act to prevent a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.730" offset="1094301">Now, I am not clear about that, Commissioner Eastman said that then Mr. Wolverton, Congressman Wolverton says, “Do you think there should be such a provision in the bill?”</text>
            <text syncTime="260.040" offset="1143515">And this is what the draftsman of the Act told the Congress whom he was hoping would enact it.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.103" offset="1171832">I would rather see it that's a prohibition against strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.243" offset="1184371">I would rather see it carried out without that because I do not believe we were going to have that question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.802" offset="1226585">Further, in the interest of time, I'm omitting some material on which we do rely that's set out in this brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.755" offset="1258350">Congressman Wolverton says, “Let us first have a frank understanding as to whether it, that's a prohibition against strikes, is included or is not included in the bill and then we can determine the policy as to whether it should be or should not be in the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.701" offset="1350196">But it certainly seems to me, says Congressman Wolverton, that the bill ought not to be left indefinite either from the standpoint of the carriers or the standpoint of the employees.We should know just what the situation is”.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.922" offset="1419055">So here, you have Congress considering a major, which has not for an incidental objective or subsidiary desideratum but a primary objective, the minimization of strikes.</text>

            <text syncTime="426.656" offset="1809951">But when that was a focal question and Congress remains silent, then I say the implication is clear that they did not intend a repeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="505.510" offset="2125406">And the client signs anything, rather preposterous illustration I admit, since positive intention to disinherit is required if not being sufficient that the testator doesn't simply intend to go out of his way to remember them.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.594" offset="2197713">I say that no matter how ambiguous the will is if you will permit it to supplement it by that kind of conversation, under the parole evidence rule, it would then become immediately clear that he didn't intend to disinherit the children.</text>

            <text syncTime="775.860" offset="3206771">Now, another consideration that is of importance is that in 1950, Senate Bill -- Senate Bill, of that year, Number 340 -- 3463, known as the Donnell Bill, was introduced and largely supported by the carriers, and that bill had it been passed would have prohibited strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.655" offset="3406033">The carriers then took the position that strikes ought to be prohibited but were not effectively prohibited by the Railway Labor Act of 1934.</text>

            <text syncTime="859.122" offset="3539884">But still when there is a feeling in Congress that something isn't prohibited and the bill is introduced to prohibit it and fails the passage, I think the matter is one of some coaches though it is not conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.470" offset="3629223">Now, counsel for respondent quote much legislative history and quoted correctly, and I think in pretty -- in -- in fair context in which many statements are made by many people who talked about this bill, including a Mr. Harrison who was the union's and this brotherhood's legislative spokesman, that adjustments of minor grievances and these are concededly minor grievances is made compulsory by this bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.446" offset="3789197">Well, in -- in one sense that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.490" offset="3805288">The bill thus provide that either party may, without the consent of the other, submit a grievance to the National -- to the Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.796" offset="3854608">And there's no doubt that as long as the man -- if -- if the employee doesn't acquiesce in that Board's determination, he loses very valuable rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="967.239" offset="3972368">But we'd say that the compulsion that was contemplated, any bill that has any efficacy at all has some measure of compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.497" offset="4021373">But we say that this bill does not resuscitate the jurisdiction of federal courts to enjoin strikes over minor grievances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1026.896" offset="4210918">At that point the carrier filed the grievances with the Adjustment Board as soon as the Mediation Board withdrew from the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.854" offset="4246758">Instead of permitting the Board to process these 21 grievances, the trainmen then called their strike over them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.453" offset="4273194">Our first point is that the adjustment procedure, established by the 1934 Railway Labor Act, is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.486" offset="4305272">Of course the major disputes, those that involve the negotiation of terms of employment and these minor disputes, the ones that are considerably involved here have been treated differently by the statute and we did not consider the major disputes here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1220.274" offset="4984456">Under the 1926 Act the adjustment procedure was of course voluntary but in 1934, at the union's request, Congress replaced this voluntary machinery with the National Railroad Adjustment Board machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.360" offset="5036805">The same time, it added five general purposes to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.332" offset="5052688">First was to avoid any interruption to commerce or to the operation of any carrier engaged therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.713" offset="5074213">The fifth was to provide for the orderly settlement of grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.900" offset="5086960">This strike would violate both those purposes as well as the statutory duty imposed in Section 2, First, on all carriers and their employees to exert every reasonable effort to settle all disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.025" offset="5135444">But the section directly involved here is Section 3, First (i).</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.334" offset="5152684">That was enacted in 1934 and specifically provides for grievances to be referred to the Adjustment Board by either party, either party has the right to take them to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.110" offset="5195839">And as I explained a little earlier, they were so referred in this instance by the carrier that the Adjustment Board may not be deprived of its jurisdiction by the strike, the machinery really becomes meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.995" offset="5243382">The Board wouldn't have anything to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.305" offset="5256547">The Railway Labor Executives' Association brief concedes that Congress and either party had either a selection to submit such disputes that were not settled on the property to the Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.285" offset="5300537">Petitioners made the same concession in their brief below and Mr. Wines adhered to it orally today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.616" offset="5325824">So that it seems plain that under the language of the statute itself that either party can go to the Adjustment Board whether or not the other is willing, and the legislative history certainly crystal clear to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.849" offset="5378800">The manager of the bill was Senator Dill, who was Chairman of the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.621" offset="5401893">He explained the bill to his fellow senators before they voted on it, and in the debate he said that they were voting on a bill back and agreed to by the railroad labor organizations and providing compulsory arbitration of grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.519" offset="5457481">That's what he felt was so striking about this measure, it was the first time that that kind of a statute have been agreed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.973" offset="5483290">And the Federal Coordinator of Transportation, Commissioner Joseph Eastman was the chief draftsman of this bill.</text>

            <text syncTime="1432.725" offset="5834271">The next witnesses were the spokesman for the railroads and although they opposed the language of the bill, they agreed with Mr. Harrison, Commissioner Eastman and Senator Dill on this point that the bill did provide for compulsory determination of grievances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1738.169" offset="7056071">Well, for the first 15 years there were no strikes at all over the grievances, showing that labor certainly agreed with what their spokesman had said and what the draftsman had said as to the meaning of the 1934 Adjustment Board procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.696" offset="7118137">Court will recall that the Adjustment Board is composed equally of representatives of both the labor unions and the carriers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1767.271" offset="7172472">At least two-thirds of the decisions of the Board have been in the favor -- in favor of labor so that petitioners have nothing to fear from permitting these grievances to be processed by the Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.001" offset="7227329">Modern thought in all labor cases, railroad as well as non-railroad labor cases, is recognizing that grievances are particularly adjustable by a form of arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.543" offset="7265573">That is because, as my opponent has recognized, they are individual cases involving accrued rights growing out of existing contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.277" offset="7304443">That waspointed out by Mr. Harrison in his 1934 article in the American Federation, shortly following the enactment of this in which he appreciated that the adjudication by the Adjustment Board would be a proper way of disposing of these grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.428" offset="7377063">As recognized by the amicus Brotherhood's brief and award in favor of the petitioners are almost certainly to be honored by the carrier, that if not, petitioners have been given a very liberal remedy, weighted in their favor, enforcement suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.521" offset="7433488">That type of suit permits very limited review in the correctness of an award of the Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.978" offset="7455326">The findings, in order of the Board, are made prima facie evidence cost or tax to the Government under the successful the petitioners recovered the reasonable attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.424" offset="7505063">The construction of Section 3, first by the court below does not hurt the employees but benefits them, we believe, since it is to their interest to avoid saturation of work and loss of pay during adjustment proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.106" offset="7551770">Petitioners must think it is better to throw everybody out of work to enforce the demands of a few, when there are only a few involved here, rather than for everybody to work while those aggrieved are obtaining remedies by early processes, rather than and go into the Donnell Bill, it was the 1950 bill, I will rely on our brief which discusses that at page 48 and following.</text>

            <text syncTime="2199.456" offset="8901151">Our position simply is that the Norris-LaGuardia Act does not prevent the courts from enforcing the Railway Labor Act, and that is what we are attempting to do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.441" offset="8933125">The injunction awarded below is the only means of enforcing Section 3, First procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.729" offset="8962278">All we are asking the Court to do is again to adopt the argument that the Government made in the Virginian case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.064" offset="8991640">We excerpted the Government's brief it appears at page 67 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.259" offset="9008358">The nub of it is that the -- when in conflict, the specific terms of the later act must prevail over the general provisions of the earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.815" offset="9046601">There, the Court held unanimously, you will recall that the provisions of the 1934 Railway Labor Act used the words of Mr. Justice Stone, rendered nugatory the earlier and more general provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.793" offset="9098533">That case was not unprecedented, it followed another unanimous decision that in the Railway Clerks case involving Section 20 of the Clayton Act, that courts should grant injunctions to enforce the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.150" offset="9143986">And the rule of this Railway Clerks case was very familiar to the draftsman of the 1934 Act as it appears in the hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.699" offset="9178154">In other words, the draftsman knew that injunctions need not be specifically mentioned in the 1934 measure for enforcement to be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.334" offset="9212740">In the Burley case, too, it was noted that the commands of the Railway Labor Act including this very Section 3, First (i) are judicially enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.381" offset="9256939">We believe that the contention that the petitioner is making here was under the Norris-LaGuardia Act was already rejected by this Court in the Howard case in 343 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.626" offset="9301870">They're the same petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.324" offset="9308662">The Brotherhoods of -- Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen had used strike threats to force the carrier to bar Negroes from certain duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.550" offset="9337605">As here, their principal reliance in this Court was on the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.095" offset="9355786">But nevertheless, the Court held in the Howard case that the District Court has jurisdiction and power to issue necessary injunctive orders notwithstanding the provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.508" offset="9393403">And the District Court was told to award appropriate relief which would necessarily have the effect of enjoining further strike threats.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.800" offset="9426526">Norris-LaGuardia Act makes no exception for Negroes, so that it seems apparent that in the Howard, Graham, Steel, and Tunstall cases, this Court was recognizing that Congress does not mean the commands of the 1934 Act to become elusory because of the -- the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.980" offset="9499251">A case very like the Howard case was decided by the Eighth Circuit also involving this -- the same trainmen, the Rolfes case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.785" offset="9526523">There the trainmen struck over certain grievances of dining cars stewards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.516" offset="9545435">And the Court held that the rival waiters-in-charge were entitled to resort to the Adjustment Board, and an injunction was issued against the trainmen permitted fairly with the opportunity for the Adjustment Board to function as contemplated by the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.612" offset="9605831">After citing the Graham, Virginian, Steel, and Tunstall cases, the Eighth Circuit ruled that the Norris-LaGuardia Act does not deprive the federal courts or to issue an injunction in aid of the Adjustment Board, and to preserve the right of the Adjustment Board procedure -- to resort to the Adjustment Board procedure provided by Congress under the 1934 Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2578.201" offset="10416149">Mr. Wines relied heavily on the Central of Georgia case on the Norris-LaGuardia point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.101" offset="10435793">But as I stated a little earlier the trainmen there assert that that involves a major dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.411" offset="10457004">And if so we have no quarrel with the result on the Central of Georgia case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.359" offset="10472782">It involves a minor dispute, a grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.258" offset="10492426">We think that Judge Brown's dissent was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.435" offset="10517086">The petitioner has conceded below that it would be proper to enjoin even strikes over major disputes in violation of Sections 5, First (b) and 10 of the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.207" offset="10552195">They have no specific clauses as to injunctions either, and that the Norris-LaGuardia Act permits injunctions there that permits injunctions equally here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.365" offset="10588871">Hardly any of the commands of the Railway Labor Act are self-executing but that has not been held to preclude judicial relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.462" offset="10621262">The amicus Railway Labor Executive Association admits that the Norris-LaGuardia Act does not apply upon when the Court is called upon to compel compliance with positive mandates of the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.517" offset="10661491">That is all we are seeking here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.794" offset="10666506">That is our position, that we are seeking compliance with mandatory provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.146" offset="10692002">The debates on the Norris-LaGuardia Act of course preceded by two years, the enactment of the 1934 provisions on which we rely in the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.044" offset="10731499">Nevertheless, it is of interest to know what Representative LaGuardia stated as the effect of the Norris-LaGuardia Act other than Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.079" offset="10763682">And this passage is not cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.199" offset="10772146">I came across it when preparing for argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.799" offset="10786565">Colloquy occurs at 75 Cong. Rec. 5499, Mr. LaGuardia stated, "We then passed the Railroad Labor Act and that takes care of the whole labor situation pertaining to the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.313" offset="10836616">They could not possibly come under this for the reason that we've provided the machinery there for settling labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.745" offset="10862320">And then Mr. Lankford of Virginia askedhim, "The Norris-LaGuardia Act does not apply to the transportation of milk or other necessities that go in interstate commerce?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.309" offset="10896593">Mr. LaGuardia, "Interstate traffic is entirely covered in the Railroad Labor Act of 1926."</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.611" offset="10921775">Now then, a little later in the debate at page 5504 and this is the last quotation expect to make, he stated, "So that there is the tie up between the provisions of the Railroad Labor Act and the necessity of exhausting every remedy to adjust any difference which might arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.776" offset="10986454">The workers could not and would not think of going on strike before all the remedies provided in the law, referring to the Railway Labor law, have been exhausted."</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.532" offset="11021458">That sentence has repetition here because it's so apt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.891" offset="11034937">The workers could not and indeed would not think of going on strike before all the remedies provided the Railway Labor law had been exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.499" offset="11065344">If the carriers have complied, they would not be deprived of any relief which they may have law or in equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.415" offset="11089063">Well, applying his remarks here would require affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.377" offset="11104841">But injunctions were discussed in the House hearings on this very legislation in connection with grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.785" offset="11138487">Mr. Eastman referred his questionnaires to Mr. Carmalt who was the co-draftsman of the Act and Mr. Eastman's legal adviser.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.571" offset="11169625">And Mr. Carmalt stated that an injunction would lie to enjoin strikes over grievances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2791.403" offset="11268995">Mr. Eastman, in connection with grievances, discussed a proviso that was added in 1934 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.120" offset="11299819">That's the proviso to Section 2, Tenth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.492" offset="11317373">It appears at 78 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.485" offset="11329285">And in pertinent part it says that nor shall any court issue any process to compel a performance by an individual employee of such labor or service without his consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.944" offset="11383097">And Mr. Eastman again discussing grievances, he explained this proviso in the passage quoted at pages 30 and 31 of our brief that now that proviso protects the individual who wants to walk out but it does not cover collective action in walking out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.632" offset="11457912">And Mr. Carmalt also explained this proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.031" offset="11467525">He said that the employees, when they submitted the draft of the bill, absolve collective action but that both he and Mr. Eastman had instead redrafted the statute to provide the present verbiage Section 2, Tenth in order not to permit collective action just to permit the individual action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.587" offset="11565746">The reason for Mr. Eastman's feeling on this matter was to use his language that the bill makes it a matter of duty on the parties to this dispute, that the law is in effect in agreement on the part of the parties to arbitrate all of these minor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.703" offset="11642232">And then he stated his opinion that there ought not to be any strikes over grievances and minor disputes but that he was unwilling to take away from employees the right to strike on major issues, of course this case does not concern the major issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.400" offset="11709001">There would have been no need for the addition to the Act of the proviso in Section 2, Tenth that the Norris-LaGuardia Act permit to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.625" offset="11749857">As noted by Judge Brown in his dissent in the Central of Georgia case, the problem was really one of accommodating the two statutes rather than determining whether one repeals the other pro tanto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.923" offset="11791026">It should be noted, nevertheless, that Section 8 of the 1934 statute does state that all parts are -- all acts or parts of acts inconsistent with this Act are hereby repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.171" offset="11840031">This provision furnishes an additional basis for the holdings of the Virginian, Steele, Tunstall, Graham, and Howard cases on which we rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.555" offset="11885589">It should be made explicit that the injunction in this case does not impinge on the policies of the Norris-LaGuardia Act for it does not take sides at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.077" offset="11923728">It permits these individual grievances to be settled without throwing everybody else out of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.708" offset="11946193">The petitioners prevail before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.633" offset="11953925">They will of course receive back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.759" offset="11966360">Here, all the parties and the public are -- are protected by requiring that these grievances be settled by the administrative body that Congress chose to settle them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.032" offset="12007528">The evils that which the Norris-LaGuardia Act was aimed are not present here, after all these are minor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.911" offset="12031039">Congress picked a Board for their settlement as Mr. Eastman called the final arbiter and Mr. Harrison a little more picturesque when he called the fire department to settle all these disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.044" offset="12079522">If the decision below is reversed the Adjustment Board will be left to vegetate with no functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.854" offset="12098748">The brotherhoods will feel free to strike over grievances instead of permitting them to be decided by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.663" offset="12122049">Thus the Adjustment Board provisions would become a mockery of what was intended by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.031" offset="12151515">In conclusion it should be noted that the respondents are not asserting that the Railway Labor Act ban strikes over the major disputes to the process as the Act has been exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.082" offset="12187669">This case concerns only the minor disputes and the principal purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.053" offset="12203551">In fact Mr. Eastman described that as the most important part of the bill was to provide compulsory arbitration of those disputes by the Adjustment Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="3112.688" offset="12554115">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, if I may, Mr. Chief Justice, quote just a few lines from that opinion declared, "If, as appellee contends, Congress had, shortly after the passage of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, intended to curtail its provisions, limiting the equity jurisdiction of the courts in labor disputes so as to subject strike action to injunction, it is inconceivable, we think, that it would not expressly have so provided.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.081" offset="12723702">That somehow the argument for the petitioners in this case, but I want to reply to Mr. Justice Black's question in my fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.620" offset="12777827">Mr. Justice Black asked whether the Act clearly delineates a demarcation between major grievances and minor grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.473" offset="12829236">Your Honor, Mr. Justice Black, I would say fairly clear -- fairly clear, however, these -- these observations are certainly pertinent and we think exigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.880" offset="12898931">In the very Central of Georgia case, there was a dispute as to whether the strike was over a major or a minor grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.135" offset="12963924">What the men struck for there was rights which though in a sense under an existing contract depended on a dispute as to the meaning of the contract and then -- and affected not only particular grievances but the rights of all other members, though they didn't seek a modification of -- of the contract but simply asserted what they said was their reading of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.608" offset="13093804">Now, the truth is that however clear or unclear maybe the lexicography of -- of these terms in the statute itself even if a strike is concededly over a minor grievance, minor being conceived and defined to be past accumulated grievances like decisions of the courts, the settlement of those grievances also for any precedents and the patterns and point the way to the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.961" offset="13219192">So that the distinction on which Mr. Cummings rely so confidently in his argument and in his brief between major and minor disputes is not very clear in economic fact even if it is fairly easy to assign a strike to one category or the other under a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.082" offset="13311666">The truth of it is, Your Honors, that it seems to us as it seem to the Court of Appeals for the -- the Fifth Circuit, that if Congress had intended to emasculate the Norris-LaGuardia Act, well Mr. Cummings' verb, which is what he says we're trying to do to this Act, it would have done so in clear unmistakable unequivocal terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.962" offset="13443218">We don't contend that there's an express continuation of the Norris-Laguardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.473" offset="13465266">We do say that -- that repeal, whether express or implied, must find -- must either be uttered or evinced in terms of an active intention to continue and a passive intention to let well enough alone and let this Court decide is not congressional repeal of any statute, certainly not one so important as the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.454" offset="13573204">The truth of it is, Your Honors, and I think this emerges clearly from the record and this concludes my argument, that this question was just too froth with implications of every kind for Congress to want to take the stand of repeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.790" offset="13650526">It was just too pregnant with all kinds of conflicts of every sort, ideological and political.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.753" offset="13682395">And Congress, we say with major deliberation, left matters where they were, left it all alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.133" offset="13711862">Although, had they been asked explicitly to reaffirm the Norris-LaGuardia Act they might or might not have done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.766" offset="13742477">They left the problem where it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.119" offset="13751881">It was a little too full of -- of dangers of all kinds and we think that they did not intend to take away from labor the right that they had bestowed on labor only two years ago.</text>
