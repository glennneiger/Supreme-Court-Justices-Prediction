            <label>Mr. Robert J. Rafferty</label>
            <text syncTime="10.998" offset="147414">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.911" offset="155042">This matter comes before Your Honors on a writ of certiorari directed to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.981" offset="187329">The petitioner, Mr. John Webb, was the plaintiff in an action brought in the Federal District Court in Chicago under the Federal Employers' Liability Act against his employer, the Illinois Central Railroad Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.416" offset="257024">A jury returned the verdict in his favor in the amount of $15,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.944" offset="279176">The respondent or defendant filed the usual post-trial motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial, both of which were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.188" offset="328077">And the railroad then took an appeal to the Court of Appeals which reversed the judgment of the trial court and directed that judgment be entered in favor of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.842" offset="382725">Mr. Webb, the petitioner was, at the time of the accident, a brakeman in the employment of the railroad, had been employed either in that capacity or as the section hand for approximately 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.339" offset="440717">On July 2nd, 1952, his duties took him together with the members of his train crew to the community of Mount Olive, Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.418" offset="489096">And at that point, Your Honors, there are certain tracks which are involved in this case in which are referred to in the Court of Appeals' opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.214" offset="532250">If I may direct your attention to a photograph at page 112 of the record, it shows the track layout at the -- quite in question.This document was the defendant's exhibit which was submitted by agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.056" offset="591600">To the left to the telephone pole, Your Honors will see a track which is the I.C. main line track.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.146" offset="623992">The track in the foreground -- incidentally, you're looking at the picture, you are looking north.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.565" offset="649592">The track in the foreground which shows a switch lever and switch stand to the north of the stand is referred to in the record as the passing track.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.227" offset="696299">And to the south of the stand, it's referred to as the I.C. house track.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.420" offset="721063">This is connected with the I.C. main line track by a crossover switch.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.391" offset="740916">To the right is the track of a separate railroad, the L.&amp; N. Railroad and Your Honors will note that it is also connected with the I.C. passing track and the I.C. house track.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.989" offset="799326">It's a little difficult to see that approximately six thigh length to the south of the switch stand is a small X and that is the point of the accident in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.917" offset="851048">Mr. Webb, on July 2nd, 1952 was standing at a point approximately 15 or 20 feet south of the house track switch when he observed a box car leaking green, and it was his duty to plug up that leak if possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.942" offset="927117">And for that purpose, it was his intention to go back to the caboose and get a handful of ways to use to plug up this hole.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.152" offset="964002">He turned about and according to his testimony he took one step, he put down his left foot.The left foot was caused to roll underneath him.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.362" offset="1004857">He lost his balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.810" offset="1010604">He fell down.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.786" offset="1018546">And on the ground, he observed what had caused him to fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.469" offset="1033279">It was the clinker which he described as about this size in appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.550" offset="1057520">He stated that at that time he observed a hole indicating where the clinker had been before.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.705" offset="1086151">And he testified that the roadbed was soft and left footprints as he walked in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.800" offset="1122617">Now, this area of course is in the vicinity of a switch or a switch stand and the railroad then, that is a place where good footing is on the upmost important.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.403" offset="1160965">They get on and off moving cars at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.346" offset="1172773">They work along side of moving cars at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.268" offset="1188446">Approximately three weeks to a month before this accident happened, substantial changes had been made by the I.C. in its house track.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.323" offset="1236616">Prior to that time, the passing track had been raised and within three weeks to a month before, two section crews were put to work on this Mount Olive house track and they raised it about five inches, the track, the ties and the roadbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.738" offset="1306311">And they used about 15 cubic yards of unscreened cinders and chat in order to raise the roadbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.250" offset="1344345">The section foreman testified that the source of his material was a pile which had been left before when the house track was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.953" offset="1383215">The record has not disclosed how long this pile remained in the vicinity.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.782" offset="1406516">The plaintiff, Mr. Webb, testified that it was also a customary place for the fireman of the Illinois Central Railroad to clean their fireboxes at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.971" offset="1463254">The section foreman in testifying about the size of the clinkers which were in this pile indicated that some of them were approximately two inches in diameter but he said efforts were made to exclude clinkers of that size.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.066" offset="1527620">The evidence on the record also shows that the track was closed for a use of the trainman during the time the repairs were being made.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.079" offset="1571715">Three people testified with reference to the size of the clinker and whether or not it would constitute a proper item in the roadbed ballast.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.786" offset="1610480">But first was the plaintiff, Mr. Webb himself, who testified that he had been a former section hand and the clinkers of this size should not be used in a railroad roadbed because they would not pack down and would not give good footing.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.348" offset="1676727">The next man who testified on the subject was the defendant section foreman, Mr. Rector, who actually supervised and conducted the repairs of this location.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.605" offset="1717791">Mr. Rector testified that a clinker as described should not be used in a switch stand or switching area near a switch stand.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert J. Rafferty</label>
            <text syncTime="428.832" offset="1818728">No, we don't Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.673" offset="1822072">The record is sound in that respect whether or not that would pass through the firebox.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.388" offset="1844955">I submit, however, Your Honor, that there are two possible sources of the clinker, the pile which had existed before and which by the railroad submission did include clinkers of two in size which would be somewhat the approximation of a fist and also the possibility, of course, of them having come from a firebox.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.208" offset="1928234">Mr. Webb gave his statement from the -- to the railroad, and there is a dispute existing between the parties as to whether or not the clinkering question was on top of the roadbed partially in or partially out of the roadbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.896" offset="1986957">The confusion arises because at one point he said, he did not notice whether or not the clinker was in or out of the roadbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.597" offset="2017782">I do believe, however, that he clarified that at a later time and his statement which was admitted in evidence, I think, also clarifies that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.191" offset="2056129">It appears like -- it appears at page 111, and it says, "This track had been worked on shortly before this by the trainman and the cinders were stirred up and loose.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.557" offset="2113599">And this large clinker, about six inches in circumference, was buried in the loose cinders around it so that it was not discernible from those rests of the small loose cinders.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.808" offset="2158634">It looked like the surface was leveled and good enough footing, but this cinder being solid in the loose cinders caused my foot to turn as I stepped on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.607" offset="2193847">It turned my foot and caused me to fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.602" offset="2205759">So that I injured the cartilage in my knees as I fell.”</text>
            <text syncTime="529.624" offset="2221850">I respectfully submit, Your Honor, from the record as disclosed and the inference is favorable to the plaintiff at this stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.840" offset="2254764">He fell on a clinker embedded in a roadbed near the railroad switch stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.735" offset="2282350">The jury could have found that the source of the clinker was either the old pile which had been used and raised in the house track or a clinker from the respondent's firebox.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.883" offset="2334908">The jury could have inferred that when the railroad raised its roadbed, five inches, a matter of three weeks before that the clinker was either placed in the roadbed at that time or not removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.921" offset="2387048">The evidence is positive that the area or that the materials used in the roadbed were not screened.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.798" offset="2422575">From that evidence the jury could conclude that the respondent was negligent in failing to furnish a safe place to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.015" offset="2455385">The Court of Appeals recognized all those facts and recognized that there was a possibility to use the language of the Court of Appeals that the clinker was embedded in the railroad roadbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.479" offset="2509302">But the -- the Court of Appeals went far beyond the record and neglected to tell Your Honors that in looking at the photographs, you will see in the distance several small buildings, in the Court of Appeals at page 144 in the record and its opinion referred to those buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.288" offset="2608567">It referred to the proximity of the tracks of the other railroad and referred to the fact that the record was found as to whether or not strangers frequent of the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.116" offset="2675858">And therefore, concluded that there were possibilities that the respondent was guilty, but that no probabilities could be deduced from the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.115" offset="2723819">Presumably, because the plaintiff had not negated or eliminated the possibility that the L.&amp; N. Railroad might have injected a clinker in some manner in the I.C. roadbed, presumably because it was possible that a stranger would have done the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.157" offset="2799992">And in our reply brief, I referred to several cases which at least in my opinion eliminate the question of whether or not the L.&amp; N.Railroad injected the clinker in the roadbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.402" offset="2848998">For the reason that these cases hold that if one railroad used the tracks of another with its permission, they are responsible for the negligent of the railroad where State permit to use their tracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.165" offset="2899989">So in effect, it comes down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.792" offset="2910542">Did a stranger put a clinker in the I.C. roadbed or did the I.C. Railroad or it's vice principle, the L.&amp; N. Railroad do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="711.561" offset="2949622">I submit that when the Court of Appeals search the record for a conflicting circumstantial evidence, they violated the mandate of this Court, in Lavender versus Kurn, Bailey versus Central Vermont and an innumerable line of cases which had been handed down by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.454" offset="3025168">As recently as April of this year in Schulz versus the Pennsylvania Railroad, the question of the -- of a lower court searching the record for conflicting possibilities came before the Court and with the Court's permission I will quote a small part of the opinion from page 526 at 350 U.S., "The courts below took this case from the jury because of a possibility that Schulz might have fallen on a particular spot where there happened to be no ice or that he might have fallen on a particular spot where there happened to be -- or they might have fallen from the one bolt that was partially illuminated by shore lights.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.415" offset="3201024">Doubtless, the jury could have so found and the Court allowed it to perform its function.But it would not have been compelled to draw such inferences.”</text>
            <text syncTime="783.168" offset="3236028">And in this particular case, the jury could and did find that the I. C. Railroad was negligent in furnishing a safe place to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.975" offset="3275316">I admit the possibility, a remote one, it is true that a stranger might have come on the icy roadbed and buried a clinker.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.996" offset="3311365">It's the most unlikely possibility, but it could exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.131" offset="3327875">That was a question for the jury to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.173" offset="3340100">The jury found adversely to the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.577" offset="3349713">I respectfully submit that the Court of Appeals was wrong in raising the standard of proof of probabilities as opposed to possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.404" offset="3389001">Instead of following the mandate of this Court to allow the jury to decide if the inferences were reasonable, where the conflicting circumstantial evidence put the truth and it was in further error when it substitute its own interpretation of the evidence for that of a jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="869.458" offset="3581158">He says that the foreman -- section foreman, Mr. Rector testified that when he found rocks or stones, two inches in diameter, that -- that they made efforts to exclude those stones.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.928" offset="3663078">I submit that that is not the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.411" offset="3676975">The testimony in that behalf appears at page 73 of the record and starting there at page 140 of the record there and page 73.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.894" offset="3738937">The question “Now, to the best of your ability, can you indicate about the size of the cinders and the ballast that was cropped in?”</text>
            <text syncTime="918.237" offset="3776345">Answer “The cinders were pretty clean along with this chat that we gathered up.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.461" offset="3797243">I would say two inches in diameter would be about the largest.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.445" offset="3817200">Of course, I have no way of knowing exactly what about.”</text>
            <text syncTime="932.360" offset="3832769">Now, here's the question that counsel has misstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.461" offset="3845204">Question “Well, now, is any particularly use made of larger cinders if any are found?”</text>

            <text syncTime="2479.534" offset="10021491">It's -- instruction number one, it appears in page 97 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.910" offset="10039045">That instruction said that the burden is not upon the defendant to show that he's not guilty of negligence charge but that the burden is on the plaintiff to prove as the negligence -- the charge of negligence and that he must do so by the greater weight or requirements of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.290" offset="10124518">That instruction wasn't questioned as it finally was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.087" offset="10151685">Now, we've got the point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.095" offset="10163702">When plaintiff started this case, he had four charges of negligence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.447" offset="10181151">One was failed to furnish -- to exercise ordinary care to furnish the plaintiff with a reason to safe place to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.477" offset="10209259">And by the way that's the criterion that this Court uses in all of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.015" offset="10231411">Two, that the defendant negligently placed an oversized rock in its ballast at the time of these improvements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.086" offset="10275715">Three that the defendant negligently inspected the equipment so that this rock was left in there, and four that the defendant violated its own rules and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.696" offset="10330154">Now, to close up all the evidence, the plaintiff voluntarily withdrew every one of these charges except the one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.051" offset="10359620">In other words, the one that he rely so strongly here, namely, that the railroad company negligently placed a rock in this ballast was voluntarily withdrawn by him and that appears to close the plaintiff's case in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.078" offset="10439659">Now, what his reason for withdrawing that is now coming in and trying to rely on it is something that I cannot fathom personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.079" offset="10483649">But the only reason that they usually withdraw is because they fail to make a prima facie showing such as the negligence law requires and that's what happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.204" offset="10548224">His evidence and it must be affirmative evidence did not show what he charged and because of that he voluntarily withdraw it and relied upon the -- paragraph (6) (a) of the complaint which alleged that it was -- that the defendant violated it's duty to exercise ordinary care to keep the premises safe where is the safe place to work for the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.287" offset="10712482">Now, there is also a question here as to whether or not this rock was a size of a man's fist or whether as he said it was six inches in diameter or circumference rather.</text>

            <text syncTime="2799.084" offset="11299715">-- I would like to raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.559" offset="11305566">Your Honor questioned Mr. Deany with reference to the shoveling of the cinders, 15 cubic feet into a cart and their foreman witnessing each shovel full.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.900" offset="11358960">This Court has held in Moore versus Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railroad that a jury may credit or discredit any part of a witness's testimony as here is arriving its verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.064" offset="11403577">And certainly, the jury would not be required to believe an incredible story of that type with two section crews working there that the headman stands there and watch shovel by shovel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.744" offset="11446314">He also raised the question as to whether or not certain issues were withdrawn from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.880" offset="11478915">Paragraph (4), the record shows that paragraph (5), the complaint was still an issue in the case when the case went to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.904" offset="11498977">And prior with what happened, the occurrence here and complained of, defendants through its agents and servants had made repairs in the roadbed and ground adjacent thereto and carelessly and negligently placed a large clinkers and cinders are carelessly and negligently allowed and are moved to a large clinker remain in the said cinders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.911" offset="11570970">That was an issue in the case that went to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.377" offset="11584867">Mr. Justice Reed asked the question with reference to the size of the clinker and I don't think anybody would be better fitted to state whether or not a fist size clinker did or did not belong in a roadbed in the defendants own supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.979" offset="11643277">Mr. (Inaudible) who testified at page 87 of the record, well, I asked him this question, "In your opinion, Mr. (Inaudible) with the presence of an existed -- a clinker the size of a man's fist embedded in the cinders adjacent to a switch stand represent a safe place for a train to work?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.083" offset="11711718">His answer was no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.269" offset="11720495">Reference to Lavender versus Kurn, Your Honor, which you questioned Mr. Deany about, Lavender versus Kurn with two defendants, one was the owner of Illinois Central Railroad and made the same defense in that case they did here, speculation and conjecture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.750" offset="11782353">The Court ruled against him and held those were matters of fact for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.502" offset="11797400">If a reasonable man could draw inferences from the record, the case should go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.816" offset="11818611">I submit that was the type here and the Court of Appeals in setting up the standard of proof, requiring the plaintiff to prove the case by probabilities with an error and disregarded all the prior decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.188" offset="11868139">Thank you.</text>
