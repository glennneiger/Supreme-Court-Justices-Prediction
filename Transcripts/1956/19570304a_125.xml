            <text syncTime="137.089" offset="651682">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.455" offset="665161">This case involves rail rates and therefore, the rate provisions of part one of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.222" offset="696299">But similar provisions appear in parts two, three and four dealing with the rates of motor carriers, water carriers and freight forwarders.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.670" offset="742066">The Act generally contemplates that rates will be established upon the initiative of the carriers by filing with the Commission and publishing tariffs containing the new or changed rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.084" offset="803715">Thus, paragraph 3 of Section 6 provides that the railroads may file tariffs embodying rate changes to become effective upon 30 days notice to the Commission and to the public, unless the Commission in its discretion and for good cause shown allow such great changes to be made on less than 30 days notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.317" offset="892635">Now, prior to 1910, the Interstate Commerce Commission had no power to prevent railroad initiated rates from becoming effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.648" offset="937984">It could only set them aside as unlawful after a full hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.810" offset="962644">It was in the Mann-Elkins Act of 1910 for the first time that Congress empowered the Commission to suspend railroad initiated rates before they became effective and for a specified period pending an investigation by the Commission into the lawfulness of the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.560" offset="1037563">That statutory period of suspension has -- has been changed by Congress from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.798" offset="1058565">And at the present time under Section 15 paragraph (7) of the Act, the Commission may suspend rail rates for a period not to exceed in seven months.</text>

            <text syncTime="266.594" offset="1169742">It would then be set as -- then that'd be an order which we get into Court in some more time and if eventually the -- the Commission's order were sustained preparation proceedings that may begun for the past payments, is that right?</text>

            <text syncTime="346.221" offset="1488227">In that -- in that connection, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, at the present time, the Commission exercises its rate suspension powers, almost entirely upon the application of shipping or competing carriers that rather than upon its own motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.471" offset="1553220">At the end of the seven-month suspension period, the railroad may make -- put the rates into effect without winning for the completion of the Commission's investigation if it's still going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.328" offset="1596688">And once the rates have become effective, the carrier must observe under the provisions of Section 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.213" offset="1632214">I should say that almost identical rate suspension provisions appear in the Natural Gas Act, the Federal Power Act, the Communications Act and the Civil Aeronautics Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.920" offset="1675055">The Commission has created both an organization and the procedure for handling these rate suspension matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.536" offset="1701491">Pursuant to its delegation powers under Section 17, it has delegated to the Board of Suspension, consisting of five employees of the Commission, the power to act upon protest, as they are called, which seek the suspension of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.886" offset="1778918">Both protestants and the respondent carriers may appeal from the decision of the Board of Suspension to Division 2 of the Commission, Division 2 consisting of three members of the Commission who are responsible under the full commission for rate matters generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.212" offset="1848195">By regulations published in the federal register, the Commission has prescribed the procedure which I would like to describe very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.449" offset="1881213">These regulations provide that the proceedings before the Board of Suspension shall be informal.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.061" offset="1899604">No transcription of its proceedings is made, subpoenas are not issued, olds are not administered.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert W. Ginnane</label>
            <text syncTime="1607.921" offset="6535084">Now, they mentioned in response to Mr. Justice Douglas question, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has recently held in the group of cases under the Natural Gas Act that orders of the Federal Power Commission suspending rates are not subject to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.886" offset="6602898">And one of those cases, the Humble Oil &amp; Refining case, in which this Court denied certiorari, the Fifth Circuit characterized this type of order in words which we think fit here better than anything we can say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.553" offset="6653576">It said, "The order in question is in no proper sense, a definitive order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.078" offset="6671653">It is a mere procedural step taking at the inception of and not upon the completion of the administrative process."</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.541" offset="6697566">A realistic appraise of the order and the function it performs demonstrates that it is interlocutory and that its issuance had but one objective in view to maintain the status quo between the seller and purchaser pending the exercise of the Commission statutory jurisdiction to inquire the lawfulness of the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.020" offset="6779486">In this discretionary and preliminary character of rate suspension actions, it seems to us, is emphasized by the fact that Congress has provided two full administrative remedies for shippers and carriers who are -- who object to new rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.316" offset="6856600">In this case, the appellee motor carriers could have participated and -- and in fact, they did participate in the Commission's full investigation and hearing of the lawfulness of these new rail rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.020" offset="6911457">Moreover, if the Commission had not instituted an investigation under Section 15, as it did, if it had not done so, then the objective motor carriers or any shippers who wanted to object could have filed a formal complaint with the Commission under Section 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.457" offset="6977181">And the Commission would have been required to undertake a full investigation in hearing into the lawfulness of the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.333" offset="7004662">And this Court held long ago in United States v. Merchants Association in 243 U.S., that these remedies provided by Sections 13 and 15 are administrative remedies which must be exhausted by shippers and by carriers before they can invoke judicial remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.444" offset="7093164">As a matter of fact, that will -- that was laid down in that case in a more drastic situation on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.686" offset="7118137">That was a case where involving the long-haul, short-haul provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.033" offset="7155545">Intermediate communities and shippers protested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.098" offset="7167770">The Commission has granted relief from the Section 4 prohibition against charging more for a long-haul than for a shorter haul.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.108" offset="7199848">And this Court held that not even the intervening communities and shippers could challenge the Section 4 order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.770" offset="7234435">There was no question but that they were effective, but they must exhaust their remedy either under Section 13 or under Section 15 before they could come in to Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.289" offset="7284485">We submit that the cases relied upon by the appellees as supporting their reviewability of suspension actions are easily distinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.290" offset="7316564">And I'll mention just one for an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.535" offset="7325550">That's the Utah Fuel Company v. Bituminous Coal Commission at 306 of this court's reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.301" offset="7352613">That case on its face involved the claim of injury of a type which as this Court recognized, Congress had not provided any remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.369" offset="7388871">In contrast here, Congress has provided remedies in Sections 13 and 15 of the Act which this Court, 50 years ago, said it must be exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.178" offset="7432129">However, the appellee's most specific reliance is upon the Fourth Circuit's decision in the Atlantic Seaboard Corporation case and the Tenth Circuit's decision, in the Phillips Petroleum v. Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.397" offset="7492942">Now, the Atlantic Seaboard Corporation case involved the issue of whether the Federal Power Commission had suspended rates for longer than the five-month period authorized by the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.909" offset="7546964">The Phillips case involved the question whether the Federal Power Commission's rate suspension power could be applied to rate increases which resulted from an escalator clause in a contract which was in effect prior to this Court's basic decision in Phillips Petroleum v. State of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.170" offset="7624077">And it seems to us that those cases are distinguishable and that they can go right to the question of whether the Commission is -- as to whether agency was acting within its statutory authority, within the statutory jurisdiction, whereas this case involves the exercise of admitted power to suspend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.755" offset="7710386">The opinion of the District Court particularly at pages 53 and 55, in the case that it thought that Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, subjected orders such as rate suspension orders to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.487" offset="7777364">We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.240" offset="7788335">In our brief, we point out that the review provision of Section 10 of the APA, a purport by the introductory clause accepts so far as statutes preclude judicial review and to agency action is by law committed to agency discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.870" offset="7858866">We point out that this Court has repeatedly held in a serious of recent cases that this introductory clause -- clauses limit and qualify the other provisions of Section 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.133" offset="7915917">We also point out that Section 10 specifically avoids making it reviewable, the preliminary and procedural interlocutory orders of agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.406" offset="7984985">Thus, Section 10 (c) provides that such orders shall be directly reviewable by the courts only where Congress so prescribes and Congress has not so required here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.041" offset="8027512">And on the last term, this Court noted in the Colorado Interstate Gas case, that the Administrative Procedure Act purports to strengthen them but rather than to weaken the rule that administrative remedies must be exhausted before it resort to judicial remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.389" offset="8092923">And so we submit that nothing in the law, either in the Administrative Procedure Act or into the whole body of law developed by this Court on -- to reviewability of agency action supports the decision below that the Commission's order vacating a prior suspension order was reviewable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2474.942" offset="10003101">The later order of November 14, vacating the prior suspension order, contains the following statement which appears at page 47 of the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="2498.376" offset="10096828">Now, the District Court based its conclusion on several -- on several factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.544" offset="10121592">First, it said that the vacating order should have been accompanied by findings so as to facilitate judicial review, so that our reviewing court would understand the reasons for the Commission's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.683" offset="10166105">But it's cited as authority for them, only a group of cases such as this Court's decision in Florida v. United States which stand for the proposition that such findings are required to support a final order made after the receipt of evidence in a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.139" offset="10239979">No one of those cases relied upon by the District Court stands for the proposition that preliminary tentative orders such as these suspension actions must be accompanied by findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.585" offset="10285746">And also as we contend that there is no -- there is no judicial review here to be facilitated by findings and -- and the conventional sense of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.830" offset="10326706">Secondly, the court below held that a requirement of findings was contained in Section 8 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act, but the finding's requirements of Section 8 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act applies only to orders issued after a hearing, a formal hearing which evidence is received.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.429" offset="10401102">And this Court has specifically so held in the American Trucking case in 344 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.117" offset="10427852">And since the Commission does not required to hold a hearing before it exercises its suspension powers, then it would seem that Section 8 (b) is finding new requirements can't possibly apply here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2666.649" offset="10769951">For example, that -- referring to the suspension order of the District Court -- the District Court said that all parties were entitled to take this for its face value as a deliberate responsible articulate finding that the proposed rates would produce these illegal results.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.306" offset="10832645">Well, of course, the Commission didn't make any such finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.856" offset="10846751">He said, "On consideration of the documents before us, there is reason to believe."</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.007" offset="10871411">Perhaps, it could be phrased as -- as a finding of probable cause on -- on the basis of speedy consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.459" offset="10905161">And note that Division 2 had one day, September 23, on which to decide whether to suspend the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.937" offset="10939120">And that one day and as addition to its original duty -- an addition to its other duties, it decides to suspend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.679" offset="10970049">It's on the basis of informal written presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.819" offset="10990634">These are not deliberate findings that most finding of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.376" offset="11020831">We submit that this -- that the rationale of the District Court overlooks that basic character of the whole suspension process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.855" offset="11054791">And turning to Section 15 (7) again, that requires the Commission when it suspends rates to state reasons to the carrier which initiated the rates and whether Commission refuses to suspend rates, it's not required to give reasons and customarily, it does not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.502" offset="11121351">And we submit that there's no practical difference between an original refusal to suspend and a later order vacating a prior suspension order because the net result is always the same that upon considering the available information and other limitations of time, ought means that the Commission in that is not sufficiently convinced that the rates are unlawful to interfere with the carrier statutory right to initiate rates subject to being set aside after a hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2994.538" offset="12081507">I would like to develop briefly with the time alloted some of the questions that might be involved on the mootness issue which Mr. Justice Harlan raised and Mr. Justice Frankfurter has discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.768" offset="12150471">I think the best way to -- to follow this mootness question is to follow the chronology of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.302" offset="12184534">The contention of these appellee seemed to be that the question of mootness arises out of the fact that since the suspension order of September the 23rd, 1955 expired by its own terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.178" offset="12244093">On April the 23rd, 1956, some seven months later, that the entire matter then came to a rest and there is nothing further to be decided or there is now not left any justiciable controversy to the exploration of this -- this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.338" offset="12324760">Now, I think that the situation can best be illustrated like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.061" offset="12355584">Following the vacation of the suspension by the Commission on November the 14th, effective as of November the 24th, the rail carriers filed a supplement putting in these reduced rates and they became effective on November the 24th and they were affected -- effective for nine weeks that is until the Court set them aside in their judgment of January the 24th.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.501" offset="12485360">Now, when the Court set them aside on January the 24th, it did not say "Cancel these rates as of this moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.274" offset="12520469">Leave the rates that were in effect for this intervening nine weeks period in effect."</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.084" offset="12539695">They said, "No.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.060" offset="12547636">Go back now to November the 24th and the rates that were in effect at that time should have been in effect all during these nine weeks period."</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.461" offset="12593194">The consequence of that, insofar as the railroads are concern, is that we have undercharged the shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.181" offset="12628093">Since we charged them a lower basis of rate for that nine-week period, then the Court said we should have charged them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.848" offset="12654738">Now then, we have got the obligation under the Elkins Act to collect those undercharges if the lower court's decision is correct because a carrier cannot charge any shipper anything other than the published rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.445" offset="12721194">And since the Court says that the only rate that was published in this case was the rates that were in effect prior to the vacation of the suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.602" offset="12757765">Now, going on one step further, that's the railroad's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.625" offset="12777827">Beginning on January the 24th, the date of the judgment of the trial court in which they said, "Now, go back to November the 24th and put all these -- all rates back into existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.575" offset="12821713">That's the way the situation should be."</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.209" offset="12832162">Then beginning from that time forward, the shippers and carriers have the question as to whether or not from January 24th to the exploration suspension order whether or not they were overcharged because you see the Court has reinstituted the higher rates or reestablished the higher rates that were in existence as of that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.436" offset="12925158">So they have got three months, so what they view as overcharges by the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.875" offset="12950862">Now then, with those two issues in the matter, it is not a moot controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.109" offset="12971760">There is something to be decided here and it's a very same consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.713" offset="12990255">Those considerations, the very same consideration, that this Court took into consideration in the Southern Pacific case and the -- which is not cited in the appellee's brief and in Southern Pacific Company against ICC at 219 U.S., 433.</text>

            <text syncTime="3255.514" offset="13125465">Now in that case, the Court said -- this Court said, the contention of mootness is disposed off by the Southern Pacific Terminal Company case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3458.640" offset="13937977">Now then, if I might go on in limited time, there is -- the further point in this case of the Court intruding into the rate making function, the lower court's intrusion into that function by setting aside rates which were lawfully in effect and reestablishing rates which had been cancelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.817" offset="14050617">Now, I briefly touch on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.853" offset="14078830">As we pointed out, the challenged order of November 14th vacated the suspension as of November 24th.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.588" offset="14113729">On that day, these reduced rates went into effect and were in effect until voided by lower court's opinion in January.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.686" offset="14150092">In the complaint filed in this case by the appellees, we find this statement, once a schedule becomes effective, there is considerable doubt whether even a subsequent setting aside of the Commission's order could in law have the effect of cancelling the schedules in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.195" offset="14232116">Now, we have agreed with that contention ever since we have been proceeding in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.090" offset="14251760">We think that is a sound contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.249" offset="14260328">It is a contention that was raised by the appellees in order to prevail upon the lower court to grant him a temporary restraining order which he denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.910" offset="14298990">The Commission's power to set aside rates, which is touched on by Mr. Ginnane which are already in effect, is limited by these restrictions of Section 15 including the requirements of a full hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.277" offset="14360430">Now, to compel, as this lower court would do, the Commission to take such action without a full hearing would be to telling the Commission to disregard their statutory limitations and proceed as the Court direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.200" offset="14416123">Now then, the grant of power to the Commission to suspend rates prior to their effective date was itself innovation or radical departure by the Mann-Elkins Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.963" offset="14463248">It represented as Mr. Ginnane has already stated an exception to this traditional right of the carriers to initiate their -- all rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.081" offset="14495744">But the effect of this lower court's decision is to suspend rates after they have gone into effect but prior to a full hearing which the Commission is not even empowered by the Act to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.969" offset="14551228">If the Commission's orders, when it gets into a question of reasonableness of rates, other than on the reparation issue, they do not cancel rates retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.157" offset="14595950">They order them cancel if they find them unreasonable and unjust prospectively but not retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.105" offset="14627819">But this Court has gone one step further and ordered them cancelled retroactively before April hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.008" offset="14655404">Now, when they get into a situation of that nature, they are actually in the field of rate making because they are establishing rates which the Commission has not established, which the carriers have not established and they are actually putting those rates into the book entirely contrary to any authority even resting with the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
