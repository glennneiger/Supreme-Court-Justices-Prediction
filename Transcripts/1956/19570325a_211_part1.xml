            <label>Justice Arthur J. Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="22.127" offset="191927">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.353" offset="200808">The ultimate question presented for decision in this case is raised by the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.346" offset="244799">That question is whether the Federal District Court has authority in a suit brought under Section 301 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act to compel compliance by an employer with his contract to arbitrate disputes, arising under the collective bargaining agreement with the union, which union represents employees in an industry affecting commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.736" offset="358275">The same question with some minor variations is presented in the two cases which follow on the docket.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.406" offset="392965">I shall not, of course, attempt to argue those cases for counseling those cases, although one is my colleague, but I should like to indicate to the Court what questions are common to all three cases in presenting the Lincoln Mills case to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.607" offset="457749">Before doing so, however, I think it would be helpful and appropriate if I give a resume of the salient facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.178" offset="496097">The petitioner, Textile Workers Union of America, formerly CIO and now AFL-CIO, is a labor organization representing the employees of the respondent, Lincoln Mills of Huntsville, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.651" offset="561925">This company owns and operates a textile mill in Huntsville.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.869" offset="586898">The company is engaged in an industry affecting commerce and is subject to the Labor Relations Act of 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.429" offset="625037">In June of 1953, the parties entered into a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.983" offset="651264">The agreement which is reproduced in the record, is the usual type of collective bargaining agreement and key to the argument and decision of this case as the fact that this agreement contained a no-strike clause on the part of the union and a common agreement as a consideration therefore to arbitrate disputes arising in the construction and termination of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.576" offset="765680">The agreement contains the usual grievance machinery, which is applicable today to most collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.793" offset="798595">It is a three-step grievance machinery, and the fourth step of the grievance machinery is arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.339" offset="832763">And I want in a moment to distinguish between the different types of arbitration involved and particularly the one involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.640" offset="869961">The complaint in this case and the controversy in this case involves 10 grievances, filed by the union in the first step of the grievance procedure in June of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.057" offset="915623">The grievances, and it is important to note what they are, are found on page 19 to 28 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.806" offset="950627">These grievances are concerned with workloads and work assignments, not an uncommon grievance in a textile plant or for that matter, in other plants.</text>

            <label>Justice Arthur J. Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="246.644" offset="1089912">I might say, Your Honors, that just the other day, too late to include in the brief, I received the annual report of the American Arbitration Association for this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.855" offset="1138813">The type of grievance involved here is becoming an increasingly large part of grievances which are subject to arbitration proceedings and collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.356" offset="1188760">And it may be interesting to note what these grievances are according to the history of the American Arbitration Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.432" offset="1213106">25% of the total amount of grievance arbitrations heard in 1956 relate to discharge and other forms of discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.743" offset="1254379">23% include job evaluation, workload and wage incentives in which category of these grievances rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.691" offset="1294085">30% of the total, relate to seniority, and 6% of the total are overtime and then there's a minor amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.529" offset="1329507">This is contained in the 1956 annual report of the American Arbitration Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.024" offset="1351450">I want to ask counsel if you might want to look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.943" offset="1367124">Now, the -- the grievances in this case are covered by a special section of the labor contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.790" offset="1398575">This is Article V which is found in the record on pages 11 and 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.341" offset="1420727">The reason for the special treatment is that in conjunction with any arbitration proceeding of grievances of this character, it was provide -- it was provided that while the American Arbitration Association might select the arbitrator, it should be done from -- the arbitrator should be a person having special knowledge of this particular type of problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.244" offset="1516335">This also is not uncommon because there are many contracts that with reference to matters of industrial engineering, call for this type of special arbitration machinery, although many contracts, of course, do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.770" offset="1574431">Now, under Article V of the agreement, the company had the right to make changes of this type based upon some management and engineering practice upon written notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.659" offset="1626049">The union was required and the employees in the plant were required to work under the change made by the management for a four-week period to give it a fair try.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.934" offset="1671084">And then, if they were not satisfied with the situation that developed, the grievance could be filed and ultimately, arbitration could be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.799" offset="1722598">The -- in the -- in the instant case, the grievances were processed by the union through various steps of the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.956" offset="1763244">They were finally denied by the company on July 14th, 15th and 22nd of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.329" offset="1792711">The collective bargaining agreement had expired pursuant to notice under its terms on July 3rd, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.745" offset="1830327">The -- I have tried to check independently of the record as to what happened to the collective bargaining agreement for the information of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.983" offset="1863346">Mr. Constangy has greater familiarity than I do with that subject since he represents the company locally.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.366" offset="1888841">My understanding is that for a while after the exploration, there was no agreement then there was a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.808" offset="1922591">Ultimately, the strike was settled and sometime later in 1955, the agreement was reinstated with some changes, but nonmaterial to the work assignment and workload clause and that there was a provision in the settlement agreement that provided that these particular grievances, which were then pending in Court, would be determined with respect to arbitrality -- arbitrability by the decision of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.360" offset="2048815">They were preserved in that manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1715.596" offset="6965791">There is a difference between three of the circuits or one way to the other and relief under 301, which is the first point I argue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.862" offset="7010826">The First Circuit says, “There is no relief under 301, although, there is jurisdiction under 301.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1740.307" offset="7064639">And the Seventh Circuit says, “In this recent case, there is no relief under 301.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.290" offset="7088567">Now, I want to move quickly now to the legal issues involved and only mention one other fact which may be of great interest to you, and that is the importance beyond the question of the conflicts in these circuits on these various points, the whole importance to the public, to the labor movement, to employers of the -- and the prevalence of this type of arbitration contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.373" offset="7208835">The recent studies by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and other government agencies and private agencies like the BNA, which have circulated and they examined many contracts, seems to be that 90% of contracts today contained provisions for arbitration of grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.910" offset="7295039">Now, I think we -- we ought to distinguish since I'll have to make reference to it a little later on the question of contract arbitrations and grievance arbitrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.288" offset="7340492">A contract arbitration is an arbitration where the parties agree that upon termination of the agreement, they will arbitrate the terms of a new agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.458" offset="7381243">That's called contract arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.660" offset="7390020">Historically, that was what we thought we were talking about 25 years ago, by in large, when we dealt with arbitrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.236" offset="7424293">We go back 50 years when we talked about arbitrations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1872.033" offset="7591476">The issue tendered here is whether 301 is to be interpreted as a grant of federal jurisdiction in a case such as like this such as this and in related cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1896.545" offset="7689592">And by the way, I should mention that the record shows that the right to arbitrate in this labor agreement is reserved to the union and the company and is not a right of the individual employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.814" offset="7750614">Now, the initial objection to the assertion of jurisdiction, which is always made now since Westinghouse is Westinghouse.</text>

            <text syncTime="1926.635" offset="7809964">I read Westinghouse in all of the opinions that were rendered as asserting that the right of an employee to recover wages due is a right which was not encompassed within the grant made in 301 for unions and employers to sue each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.216" offset="7892198">I do not believe that any reading in the case leads to any conclusion that anything beyond that was decided in Westinghouse.</text>
