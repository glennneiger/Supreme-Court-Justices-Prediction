            <label>Mr. John S. Wrinkle</label>
            <text syncTime="9.072" offset="139682">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.182" offset="152116">This case is hereby writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court of Appeals in the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.431" offset="189106">I think it's -- well, within the views of Mr. Justice Frankfurter's -- on Monday and concurred in by Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.677" offset="234036">It originated in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, Southern Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.397" offset="264965">It's a suit on a policy of National Service Life Insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.934" offset="295058">Charles Oscar Peak Jr., then 18 years of age was inducted in the military service on April the 29th, 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.965" offset="347199">And he applied for and received deposit insurance effective May the 1st, 1943, and he continued to serve until July the 5th, 1943 when he disappeared and no tidings or intelligence had been heard of him, since.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.742" offset="442389">And the suit was filed on the 19th day of February in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.976" offset="479274">He's insisted in the complaint that presumption of death took effect on the 5th of July, 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.755" offset="530369">Sometime thereafter, Mrs. Peak, Leona Peak, the mother and the beneficiary of the policy applied to the Veterans Administration for the benefits of the policy and that was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.915" offset="591078">And she then filed a suit in the complaint that's charged that he was suffering from chorea, nervousness, general disability, and weakness, despondency and St. Vitus Dance and that he was home loving, devoted to his parents to his only sister that he communicated with them regularly and that they had a letter dated, the 30th of July 1943, and no intelligent or tidings from him since and that in his disabled condition, it's alleged that he was totally and permanently disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.513" offset="793475">That allegation in the complaint is not for seeking to keep the insurance and the fact by virtues having waiver of the premiums on the policy because no act to such application was made nor did Mrs. Peak here will make any such application, unless it could be considered in applying to the Veterans Administration for the benefits of the policy that she did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.967" offset="907264">It's also alleged in the declaration that on a private insurance policy in American National Life Insurance Company in which the file there was the beneficiary that the suit was filed in the Chancery Court of Hamilton County, Tennessee, to declare that he was dead and that he died on or about the day to his disappearance, July the 30th, 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.926" offset="1023039">That case was heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.345" offset="1032756">I didn't tried that case and didn't come into this one until some time later, but it was decreed by the chancellor that the conditions that are set out in the complaint that he couldn't have lived for any length of time and that he did die on or about July the 30th, 1943, and that policy was paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.873" offset="1138813">Now, the Government's plea to the complaint filed by Mrs. Peak was to dismiss first because of lack of jurisdiction in the United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.033" offset="1195551">And second, because there was no cause of action or grounds for payment stated in -- in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.977" offset="1239228">And the District Judge construed Section 810 of the Title 38 of the code that was for the purpose, we think, to make uniform throughout the United States, the law with respect to -- in National Service Life Insurance policies that the death couldn't take effect under that statute or be construed to except at the end of the seven-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.001" offset="1375378">It is our insistence that -- that statute didn't undertake to repeal and didn't repeal the English common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.895" offset="1410905">And that the presumption wise at -- July the 30th, 1950, that the soldier was dead but left open in subject to prove as to whether he died on July the 30th and the circumstances of his disappearance, and his physical and mental condition, and his experience in life in whether he could have lived for any lengths of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.537" offset="1533471">We insist that he died on July the 5th that his nature was such that he certainly would've communicated with his family right away.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.223" offset="1584253">If anything had happened to him, he could have communicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.111" offset="1607868">However, I asked, we, as now alleged in the complaint to accept that he disappeared on the 30th of July.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.000" offset="1647365">My understanding is that soldiers at that time recruits were paid $75,000 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.738" offset="1678294">He would have earned nearly $75,000, say $72,000, and therefore, the policy usually cost about $6 that would have kept in it in effect for 12 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.397" offset="1744959">We don't think he did die at the end of 12 months, but we think he died immediately in the facts that are stated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.476" offset="1785292">Now, the District Judge didn't pass it all upon that question of the statute of limitations of six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.836" offset="1822699">Here, it was charged in the petition that the statute of limitations was told during the seven years for waiting to see whether he was dead and whether the presumption would ever take effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.943" offset="1891140">And it went from the District Court to the Circuit Court of Appeals and the Circuit Court Appeals doesn't seem to withheld with Judge Darrah and correct in -- his interpretation of Section 810 of the Title 38.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.901" offset="1982986">They say that the complaint doesn't state cause of action, circumstances sufficient to justify a court or jury in finding and holding that he did die about July the 30th.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.239" offset="2056338">They say that it has to take some impending -- be exposed to some impending danger or some impending disaster searches in Davie versus Briggs that's decided, I believe, in 85 U.S. by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.102" offset="2143796">And we cite cases from the Fifth Circuit and from the Fourth Circuit that are contrary to the holding of the Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.957" offset="2199176">And in fact in the case of -- one case that we've cite that's the -- that's the case of United States versus Hayman, Judge Hutcheson writing the opinion of the Court that he didn't have to be exposed to the some calamity.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.639" offset="2293948">This man had Jacksonian epilepsy and he was in the Muscle Shoals area with a stranger and a strange land as was this soldier that make in Georgia and he was never heard of for any tidings or intelligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.346" offset="2360717">And if I may, I'll read what Judge Hutcheson said with respect to Davie versus Briggs.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.280" offset="2388511">The Supreme Court of United States has itself declined to accept, as exclusive, the rule of Davie versus Briggs that a proof must be made at the time of the disappearance of the person or subject to peril or danger citing at the Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Company versus Mettler 185 -- 185 U.S 308.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.746" offset="2486314">And then, in that case, it was declared that the inference of death might arise from the disappearance inconsistent with the continuance of life even though exposed to the some particular peril is not shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.346" offset="2544724">Now, the Circuit Court of Appeals in its opinion which is cited in the briefs and is published, and published in the record also, they cited the Mutual Life -- the Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance versus Mettler.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.710" offset="2622255">And in -- in that case, it wasn't held.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.110" offset="2635839">That was the case as down in Texas where a man with a team going to -- and they're on some land and he was near a little river and he disappeared and they finally found the place where he had camped and one of the horses was gone and another one was almost starved and tracks were leading toward the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.671" offset="2754017">And they didn't find any tracks of the man lead in ways in the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.788" offset="2774497">That suit was brought before seven years had expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.971" offset="2791215">And in -- in that case, this Court had proved it and cited the case of Davie versus Briggs.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.371" offset="2828831">Now, in Davie versus Briggs, it was on North Carolina land case and the complainants contended that the man that had disappeared, Allen Jones Davie, had -- had died at the end of the seven-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.974" offset="2915244">It changed the statute of limitations on the suit there, but this Court held that he had died in 1851.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.150" offset="2959966">Now, he was on a tour from North Carolina through the Indian Territory seeking the road of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.641" offset="2993925">And after he had reached the Indian Territory, he was never heard of again.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.518" offset="3017435">And Mr. -- first, Mr. Justice Harlan, wrote the opinion of the Court and according on the Court of the King's Bench said where a party has been absent seven years, without having been heard of, the only presumption arising is that if he is then dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.892" offset="3094967">There, it is none as to the time of his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.220" offset="3108237">And then the Court went on, we therefore, follow the established law when we inquire whether according to the evidence, Allen Jones Davie died at an earlier date than at the end of expiration in seven years when the legal presumption of death rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.762" offset="3178454">It seems to us that upon the showing made by the complainants themselves that conclusion is inevitable that he died some time during year 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.685" offset="3226102">The most recent case is that of Willhite, the United States versus Willhite of the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.998" offset="3259329">It originated in the State of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.254" offset="3272391">George Skinner was a soldier and was stationed at Camp Patrick Henry, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.721" offset="3298304">And he went home to visit his folks and his unit was supposed of what we will see shortly as what is the unit of the young man in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.142" offset="3339891">And he was in good health, perfect except (Inaudible) so far as the record is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.612" offset="3369775">And he had told his father and mother but not his wife that he would die before he would go overseas and had requested his father to care for the dog or his dog that he didn't expect either to ever see either his dog or his parents again.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.322" offset="3456711">He didn't report in for the Fort of Camp Patrick Henry, Virginia, and was missing a day after.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.684" offset="3490147">After seven years, this suit was brought and the District Court and the jury held that there was this vision showing that he was dead and -- and that he died about the date of his disappearance as we're insisting in -- in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.189" offset="3560155">That sir went to the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Fourth Circuit and reveal an average opinion that the Court held that jury and the lower court were correct and the action on the matter and within the proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.553" offset="3641553">Another case is United States versus Hayman that I mentioned a while ago, this Court quotes from the Hayman case at great length.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.351" offset="3692753">And -- as there's another case says a case of the United States -- Howard versus the United States that originated in the United States District Court for the District of Washington State and that was held that the statute of limitation didn't began to run until the seven-year period had elapsed as in Hayman -- United States versus Hamman and the United States versus Willhite that all three did the same holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.341" offset="3840711">Now, we -- we didn't cite the case in our brief but it's cited at -- in the Willhite case by the Circuit Court of Appeals with the Fourth Circuit of Howard versus Equitable Life Insurance Society 85 Pacific 2d 253.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.892" offset="3926915">Now, the soldier in the Howard case was Charles A. Navone and the widow had remarried.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.470" offset="3949275">There's a reason that it's filed, the Howard versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.586" offset="3977697">Now then, that case is accorded at the length and the Willhite case.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.178" offset="4004133">And another case is --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="976.508" stopTime="982.375">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="976.508" offset="4009357">What is the name of that case who counsel that you just -- the one in 85 Pacific?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_s_wrinkle" startTime="982.375" stopTime="1387.369">
            <label>Mr. John S. Wrinkle</label>
            <text syncTime="982.375" offset="4032867">Howard versus Equitable Life Insurance Society 85 Pacific 2d 253.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.877" offset="4074872">Now, that -- that case is cited in the Willhite case and -- and all the cases cite -- the Hayan case from Alabama at -- at Muscles Shouls and we -- we think unquestionably that another case as directly in point is from the Fifth Circuit and that's the Mutual Life Insurance Company versus Hamilton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.177" offset="4176123">Hamilton was a married man and with several children, grown children, and he had been in the penitentiary of Georgia for bad offense and had a great deal to more insurance and his means and his standing problem, the community would have justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.221" offset="4252296">But his mother had always stood by him and she had mortgage their home to give him some money to go in business in 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.238" offset="4288345">And he disappeared on the night of the 28th, 1929, indicating to his daughter that he was turning the business over to her and her husband and he was going elsewhere but no question with what he was in bad health but his premiums went due again for about a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.664" offset="4374026">And at the end of seven years, that suit was brought in the United States District Court in Florida against the Life Insurance Company and that went to the Circuit Court of Appeals in the Fifth Circuit and Judge Hutcheson participated in that case, cited in it that one of the other judges wrote the opinion of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.660" offset="4465977">And they say here the same thing as these other court's rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.569" offset="4497638">Now, the -- the defendant insist that the statute begins to run at the time of his disappearance and cited number of cases of this Court which in workman's compensation cases that the decision here to justify their contention in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.057" offset="4575587">We don't think it applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.655" offset="4586036">But the statute reads in -- in full that no suit or yearly renewable term insurance shall be allowed under this section unless essential had been brought within six years after the right approved on which the claim is made or within one year after the date of approval of the -- this amendatory Act, July 3rd, 1930, whichever is a later date and no suit on the United States Government Life converted the insurance shall be allowed under this section unless essential had been brought within six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.667" offset="4746010">And then the right accrued for the claim and -- and the right accrued for which the claim is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.589" offset="4777775">Now, we insist that -- that that statute includes to what was the law at the time it was passed that their common law and their law in America is that the statute doesn't begin to run until seven years and that the right didn't approve until seven years because there was no opportunity at all to prove this death and there were presumption which take effect on July the 5th, 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.165" offset="4919986">Now, the suit was well brought within six years after that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.498" offset="4945377">And we -- we think that the sovereign -- we're not asking the sovereign to waive its immunity to suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.798" offset="4990516">The -- its immunity to suit didn't begin to run until 1950 and wouldn't have expired of course until 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.437" offset="5041089">And that therefore, we are within that time provided for and the -- the statute of the District Judge construed to be binding on him as this, 810, “No straight law providing for presumption of that shall be applicable to plan for National Life Insurance.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.862" offset="5138787">Well, that's a claim, I think that means the statutory law of the state that we don't contend that any Tennessee law applies though we do cited a very famous Tennessee case where the Chief Justice held in his opinion that the statute didn't begin to run until seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.473" offset="5229275">Now then, the part that I think confused the District Judge is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.964" offset="5251218">If evidence says factual to the administrator, he's used to establishing the facts continued an unexplained absence of any individual from his home and family for a period of seven years during which the -- during which period no evidence of his existence has -- has been received.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.338" offset="5336691">The death of such individual as the date of the expiration of such period may, for the purpose of this chapter, be considered as sufficiently proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.865" offset="5378800">Now, we think that if it was sought to prove his death at the end of the seven years that that would be all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.206" offset="5416208">The District Judge whereas the inquiring by in his opinion, they'd make such a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.620" offset="5445883">He sought that perhaps it might be a waiver of premium as in that the soldier would have him waived and still be in trying to recover if it took effect at the end of the seven-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.237" offset="5496351">But we think that's just permissive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1493.743" offset="6078360">And it is that, I would like to address myself, too, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.711" offset="6098213">This insured was in the army for three months training.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.045" offset="6119528">From the time of his induction at that point, his battalion was ordered overseas and he failed to report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.222" offset="6136247">He had never been heard of since.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.394" offset="6144920">Those are the basic facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.656" offset="6154010">When he was inducted, he took out the $10,000 National Service Life Insurance contract which is here in question, four premiums were paid and after his disappearance, it lapsed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.256" offset="6200404">No further premiums were paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.552" offset="6205628">No waiver was applied for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.834" offset="6210748">There was nothing further to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.806" offset="6218585">Accordingly, this case does and must rest on the proposition that the insured died before the lapse of that policy in the summer of 1943, the statute which this -- fixed it the time within which an action can be commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.909" offset="6299042">In Section 617 of the National Service Life Insurance Act, we found on page 39 of the Government's brief, and which simply refers the question over to the appropriate provisions of the Word War Veterans Act of 1924, Section 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.374" offset="6380857">And if I may, I should like to read Section 19 as it fixes the basic limitations period with which we are here concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.585" offset="6413667">No suit on United States Government Life converted insurance shall be allowed under this Section unless the same shall have been brought within six years after the right accrued for which the claim is made or had this statute stopped at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.492" offset="6485347">This question of what was meant by the word "accrued" might well be one in some doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.827" offset="6514709">However, the statute went on to say, provided, that for the purposes of this section, it shall be deemed that the right accrued on the happening of the contingency on which the claim was founded.</text>

            <text syncTime="1628.838" offset="6618676">The first provided the clause that for the purposes of this section, it shall be deemed that the right accrued on the happening of the contingency on which the claim is founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.943" offset="6663189">That specific clause came to this Court in the Towery case, the United States against Towery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.880" offset="6690879">And this Court held that the only contingency was total disability or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.535" offset="6721494">I might say assigned that World War I Insurance, so-called War Risk Insurance, provided for a payment on either disability or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.340" offset="6764753">The National Service Life Insurance is only for death and not for disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.980" offset="6787323">Disability permits waiver but not payment in the same sense with the older insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.169" offset="6808012">This Court held that the only contingency that Congress had provided for within the meaning of this phrase was total disability or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.287" offset="6848554">In the present action, the Willhite Court-- the Willhite majority agreed with this Court and I quote from their decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.861" offset="6898813">"The contingency on which the claim is founded is the death of the insured."</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.391" offset="6928906">Therefore, the only fact which will stop the statute of limitations within the statute here is the death of the insured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.950" offset="6987212">And as I have pointed out, that death must have occurred while this insurance policy was enforced, i.e. in the summer of 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.449" offset="7041128">The statute gave such six years, thereafter, to bring suit on the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.195" offset="7056175">This action was commenced 11 years, thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.882" offset="7074879">The difference is to be found -- the difference is accounted for in Willhite by the reception into the National Service Life Insurance Act of what is referred to as a general presumption in insurance cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.003" offset="7159411">And as to that presumption, I would like to turn to because the majority in Willhite, unlike the Sixth Circuit below, took that as applying despite the terms of this statute, the National Service Life Insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.050" offset="7227538">The statute provides a specific presumption, the proof of death at the end of seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.950" offset="7271215">It was read to you by Mr. Wrinkle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.908" offset="7286993">And if I may, I would like to get the specific language of that section, again, turning back in Section 610 of the National Service Life Insurance Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.432" offset="7325132">It is no part of the World War I, the World War Veterans Act of 1924, that states first, no state law providing for presumption of death shall be applicable to claims for National Service Life Insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.456" offset="7409246">That Section was set out in the Willhite case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.619" offset="7417814">That particular sentence was never discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.357" offset="7432756">It then follows as Mr. Wrinkle read it, evidence satisfactory to the administrative being presented, death may be presumed and I quote “as of the date of the expiration of such period” -- that's the seven years -- so that we have two possibilities here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.285" offset="7520528">The petitioner in this case could rely on actual death and bring suit at anytime within six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.344" offset="7544769">On the other hand, she could take advantage of the presumption which Congress gave her and simply rest on that at the end of the seven years by merely keeping the insurance and force up to that point or alternatively by applying for waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.316" offset="7608613">She could have brought the insurance up to the seven year period and without any of the proof of these elements, disabilities or, otherwise, that were alleged in the present case had set back and rested on the total and completely unexplained absence of the insured on the presumption which Congress gave her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.306" offset="7672560">And then truly, the time would have extended for another six years because having kept the insurance in full, she could rest the death at the end of the seven years precisely as the statute provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.833" offset="7726686">Having done neither, it is necessary for the petitioner in this case to prove that the insured died twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.818" offset="7754689">First, he has to presumptively die at the end of the seven years under the statute in order to avoid the statute of limitations problem of six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.816" offset="7794604">But then, he has to die actually at the beginning of the seven years in order to bring it within the effective period of the insurance since the premiums weren't paid.</text>

            <text syncTime="2960.597" offset="11945775">My question is whether any such presumption of favorable construction is to be taken when on the face of the complaint on a given theory, statute of limitation bar recovers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2976.743" offset="12010350">If I may move on just for one further statement, we've taken the Willhite position and the Howard decisions on which it relies, the two court members in Willhite quoted at great length from the Howard case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.682" offset="12082134">The Howard case, a District Court case in Washington in turn quoted at great length from the Howard case, the state court case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.248" offset="12116407">Now, this -- this -- this chain of language from the state court case is found right through these three decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.895" offset="12150993">All I want to say at this time is that to note that in reading it, the state court was deciding the meaning of the word accrual in a state statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.843" offset="12190699">It had none of this -- none of the federal limitations before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.113" offset="12211806">That was recognized by Judge (Inaudible) in the federal Howard case, what said he, it is a general law, nevertheless, and we'll apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.144" offset="12247960">There is this much to be said for that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.012" offset="12259453">It was under the World War Veterans Act which did not have this presumption clause or the limitation against the use of state law so that it is really only with Willhite that we come flatly up against the fact that by adopting Howard which in turn adopted state law and by referring solely to what is known as general law, which is I understand it to be, is state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.181" offset="12356106">Willhite has found that despite the fixed presumption in the statute, you may use general law such as it is which I take to be state law against the statement and the statute that no state law shall be effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.212" offset="12412217">And that I think is, well, Willhite went beyond the holdings of this Court and Willhite was very careful to set out the McIver against Ragan cases and the others in this Court leading up to and of course it did not quote the Soriano case at the last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.509" offset="12485360">All of which hold to the strict construction of these limits of -- statutes of limitation in these suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.344" offset="12512737">But, the Willhite majority went on to say and I can quote precisely the whole basis for this action being up here and the discrepancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.279" offset="12544502">However, in Life Insurance case -- cases, the Courts have uniformly applied a different rule and it cites three annotations in ALR.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.458" offset="12585253">All of which, of course, are state cases, the Willhite case and this case are the only two National Service Life Insurance cases, the only two concerning the presumption which Congress put in to the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3136.702" offset="12650141">If I may go out at the record a little, Mr. C. G. Milligan who is on our brief has account some representative in the American National to Life Insurance Company and that company had felt the policy ought to being paid and he brought a suit against the father to have that settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.443" offset="12741151">And in that connection, he discovered about this insurance and thought it ought to be paid and he hadn't had experience in this sort of case and he called on me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.653" offset="12794023">Now, it's really a tragedy and this case, the boy had had childhood disease or something that disable him and he was an only son and the father was very proud of him and the mother wanted to claim exemption from the draft and the father wouldn't agree to that and they get him and in the Army and he -- one of these boys who don't (Inaudible) studied with -- what seemed to me from what I understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.214" offset="12912201">Now, with respect to the statute of limitations, Mr. Leonard would attribute to the Congress something that I don't think is fair to Congress in passing such a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.264" offset="12972387">It's been the law since the time in memorial that a presumption of death would carry it at the end of seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.111" offset="13011780">And Congress knew that when they passed this statute that's been read when it was through.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.068" offset="13047620">Now then, in no case if Mr. Leonard's interpretation were correct, would anyone recover because the statute of limitations would run of six years before seven years for the presumption of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.256" offset="13124420">And it's to be assumed that Congress well knew that rule and when they passed this statute reading, no sue to her and yes, their renewable term insurance shall be allowed under the section unless the same shall have been brought within the six years after the right accrued for which the claim is made or within one year after the day of the approval of the Mandatory Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.560" offset="13225566">That was in -- in about 1930, we're relating at that time to War Risk Insurance from World War I.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.838" offset="13258689">Now then, provided that for the purpose of this section, it shall be deemed that the right accrued on the happening of the contingency on which the claim was founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.083" offset="13299754">Now, that was there and there was no way to show that he was dead until the end of the seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.487" offset="13341341">Consequently, Congress knew the rule with respect to Life Insurance Company as generally and administration of the Life Insurance policies and we have get to read into what the common law was at that time on what they meant about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.875" offset="13422843">To me, its very clear that that was what Congress intended just like the Willhite case and the Howard case in the state court of Washington as I believe with the federal court in the Howard case with two separate ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.960" offset="13487208">The Tennessee Court's agree that Georgia -- the Florida Courts, Hamilton Mutual Life against Hamilton was a Florida case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.044" offset="13531512">This North Carolina case was a federal case, of course, under this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.238" offset="13552306">And with respect to the presumption of death in the Hayman case is the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.826" offset="13582712">There was no statute of limitations claimed there because it was before the statute had run.</text>
