            <text syncTime="29.513" offset="221393">Nearly four years ago on the 26th of May 1953, a fire was reported at a Brownstone house on Massachusetts Avenue in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.484" offset="269354">Two people lived in this house.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.346" offset="280743">One was the petitioner; the other was an elderly lady and in blood who shared the house with him for a number of years prior to the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.388" offset="320972">She was found in her bedroom by a fireman, taken outside and soon thereafter pronounced dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.384" offset="352946">Petitioner was found in the basement bathtub of this house, lying facedown in a pool of water suffering from several -- what turned out to be ice pick wounds in his chest and two in his neck.</text>

            <text syncTime="80.553" offset="425566">And apparently unconscious.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.454" offset="437164">He was carried out to the lawn, administered oxygen and an ambulance were secured to take him to emergency hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.355" offset="476766">On investigation of this fire, it appeared that it had been deliberately set.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.126" offset="503829">And since the house was found to be locked, and since all but one window in the house was found to be closed, suspicion immediately pointed the petitioners as the author of the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.234" offset="572270">Now, the petitioner was kept at emergency hospital until approximately 2:10 p.m. on the afternoon of May 26th at which time he was taken by the police to the strong room at the District of Columbia General Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.352" offset="648756">He was kept there until the morning -- late in the morning of May 28 at which time he was taken by the police to the deputy coroner and who acted as committing magistrate, and for the first time advised that he had a right to counsel, that he had a right not to make a statement, that any statement might be used against him.</text>

            <label>Mr. Blow</label>
            <text syncTime="166.537" offset="769546">Yes, Your Honor, he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.057" offset="775607">He was bedridden though the police and Fire Department inspectors testified that when they interrogated him, he was able to stand up and some said that he was able to sit up on the bed, that was in controversy, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.083" offset="831718">Nevertheless, he was in -- in a bed in this locked ward.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.131" offset="859930">The deputy coroner committed him to the custody of the Attorney General to await grand jury action.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.048" offset="895561">The grand jury, very shortly thereafter, came up with a two-count indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.021" offset="923460">Now, the first count of that indictment which is found at pages 2 and 3 of this record read, "On or about May 26, 1953 within the District of Columbia, Everett D. Green maliciously did burn and caused to be burned the certain building known as 1115 Massachusetts Avenue, the property of Gerald Gray (ph)."</text>
            <text syncTime="232.930" offset="1035055">The second count in that same indictment incorporated the language of the first and provided on or about May 26, 1953 within the District of Columbia, Everett D.Green committed the offense of arson.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.598" offset="1109765">That is to say, he maliciously did burn and caused to be burned a certain building known as 1115 Massachusetts Avenue, North west, the property of Gerald Gray (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="265.091" offset="1163786">And in perpetrating the offense of arson, a fore set, caused Bettie Brown to inhale certain gases, the inhalation of which resulted in her death within the District of Columbia on or about May 26, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.409" offset="1241004">Thus, while the first count charged the petitioner with the offense of arson under Section 401 of the District of Columbia Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.188" offset="1284159">The second count, in addition to charging him with arson, charged him with responsibility for the consequent death which under the District of Columbia Code is murder in the first degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.969" offset="1339225">And that section of the Code reads in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.269" offset="1356466">"Whoever, being of sound memory and discretion, without purpose so to do kills another and perpetrating an arson as defined in Section 401 is guilty of murder in the first degree."</text>
            <text syncTime="333.703" offset="1438177">To this indictment, the defendant pled not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.405" offset="1465031">At the conclusion of his first trial, the jury was fully and properly instructed that if they believe that the defendant was perpetrating an arson and that in the perpetration of this arson, deceased inhaled certain gasses which caused her death, they were to return a verdict of first degree murder against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.262" offset="1568371">And of course they were instructed that they could acquit him.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.928" offset="1579133">But -- and here we find the trial judge on his own motion instructing the jury that they could also find the defendant guilty of murder in the second degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.744" offset="1666382">The jury retired to consider its verdict and came back and reported to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.186" offset="1688116">We find the defendant guilty of arson on count one.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.974" offset="1703267">We find the defendant guilty of second degree murder on the second count.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.166" offset="1728031">And on March 19, 1954, the Court adjudged the petitioner guilty of arson and of second degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.635" offset="1765961">Now, this conviction of arson was never appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.511" offset="1789367">The defendant has served his sentence on that charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.820" offset="1806608">The sentence was complete on March 19, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.461" offset="1829177">But he did appeal his conviction of second degree murder and he contended that there was no evidence in the record, at his first trial, to sustain a conviction of second degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.343" offset="1888737">And this contention was accepted by the majority of the three-judge bench which heard argument on his first appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.047" offset="1927607">And that court therefore, reversed the case and remanded to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.500" offset="1961357">Once in the District Court, when it appeared that the defendant was to be prosecuted again by the Government on the same indictment on a charge of first degree felony murder, he interposed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground of former jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.976" offset="2047248">This motion was denied by the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.428" offset="2061040">The trial proceeded and resulted in the conviction, as originally charged, of murder in the first degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.505" offset="2093432">The mandatory sentence of death was imposed and petitioner brought this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.034" offset="2127496">Now, we have briefed four arguments for the petitioner and the first two involved former jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.294" offset="2168560">Should this Court sustain either, we submit that it would be proper to order the defendant released and further proceedings against him barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.698" offset="2222164">The second two, involved the question of a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.663" offset="2245987">We feel that if our contention on double jeopardy is overruled, the trial which this man have, his second trial was characterized by two errors which must result in it being vacated and sent back for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.817" offset="2338670">Of these four, outlining the brief, the first concerns the extent of waiver that will be presumed in an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.470" offset="2381302">The second relies on the rule that unappealed conviction of a lesser included offense in the offense charged in the indictment must -- are subsequent proceedings on the higher charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.567" offset="2453608">The third concerns the admission of statements which this man made to the police officers during a period of nearly two and a half days prior to this arraignment and prior to his being advised concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.577" offset="2509720">And we feel those should be and excluded under the rule promulgated by this Court in McNabb versus the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="611.504" offset="2549426">They were incriminating statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.661" offset="2561964">They were -- there were some statements designed to be exculpatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.215" offset="2580250">Nevertheless, they were given under circumstances that were inherently untrustworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.769" offset="2610448">They were vitally important to the Government's case.And since the decision of this Court in Upper versus the United States, we feel that there is no real basis for distinguishing between an exculpatory statement which hangs the petitioner or a confession which does the same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1604.360" offset="6520769">And we submit that the vigor of their dissent followed from certain remarks which were made in the Peckham opinion which indicated that this result could follow, not only from the statute in the Philippines but was not antagonistic to the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.916" offset="6627035">And exactly what they feared was going to happen has happened, and the man here has -- has been held, has been presumed to waive a constitutional right by exercising another right which the Congress gave him to appeal what he thought was an injustice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2521.330" offset="10188675">Therefore, since every killing involves an assault, they found themselves in a position where logically every murder was first degree murder and there could be no degrees of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.709" offset="10238203">Well, to that extent, the New York courts concluded that the felony has to be a slightly different offense, those cases are assault cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.342" offset="10292746">And -- and New York found itself in a very particular box there because their statute unlike ours does not enumerate the felonies which have to be proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.562" offset="10341648">Now, putting aside the question whether arson is a lesser included offense or not, the court below and the Government cite the test which has been accepted by this Court.And that test was laid down by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in Morey versus Commonwealth and it provides, "If each statute requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not, an acquittal or a conviction under either statute does not exempt the defendant from prosecution and punishment onto the other."</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.918" offset="10503084">Well, of course that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.348" offset="10512802">But here, only one statute, 2401 which define felony murder as the killing which occurred in perpetration of one of the felonies enumerated in 401, only one statute require proof of an additional fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.792" offset="10590542">That offense we -- we can't help but conclude, is the greater offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.450" offset="10621158">Naturally, it has one more element.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.623" offset="10629831">But -- but arson had to be proved in this trial for the defendant to be guilty of anything and he was convicted of arson at his first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.107" offset="10671835">He never appealed that conviction.He served his sentence, all of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.291" offset="10688554">Now, if -- if your First Amendment is designed to avoid multiplicity of the suits as we think it is, we -- we reach the rule that the Government has to take its biggest bite at the defendant the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.827" offset="10754696">Now, this is of course what the Government did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.176" offset="10764100">It took its biggest bite but it didn't get, it got the lesser and the lesser was arson and they should let matters rest there because the Government has no right of appeal in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.201" offset="10828152">I'm passing back quickly to our alternative arguments now which are the improper admission testimony and the misconduct of the prosecutor in the closing moments of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.898" offset="10890951">We have outlined the events which occurred in this case from the moment this man was picked out of this burning building until he was finally brought before a committing officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.940" offset="10943091">In effect when he had got to the committing officer and the committing officer advised him that he was under suspicion, that he had a right to counsel, that he had a right not to make a statement and that he had a right -- that any statement used might be used against him, it was too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.835" offset="11018742">The -- the horse was being stolen before -- before the door was closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.068" offset="11043610">Now, the majority of the court below held that delay in arraigning a suspect cannot be unreasonable delay or illegal detention, when he is in the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.548" offset="11125530">Now, it's' true of course that this -- this Court was concerned in McNabb versus the United States with someone who could have been brought before the committing magistrate and be advise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.014" offset="11167431">But here, this fellow, assuming for purposes of argument was -- could not be brought before the committing magistrate on the day of his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.725" offset="11206301">Perhaps, it's -- it's more questionable as to the 28th, they interrogated him two hours before taking him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3373.626" offset="13597863">There are four such factors, the Government believes present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.839" offset="13618761">The first of these is the very basis for the reversal of the first conviction and that is the defendant's contention that is conduct at the first trial was first degree murder or nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.399" offset="13676962">It was apparent then that a free trial was to be had.</text>

            <text syncTime="4031.692" offset="16230170">I think it is totally unrealistic to view the first verdict as an implied accquital.</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.896" offset="16258905">There were two counts, a count of arson and a -- a murder count.</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.979" offset="16279280">The defendant was convicted of arson at the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.390" offset="16296939">He was also convicted of second degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.745" offset="16310314">The only evidence as to the death, the cause of the death of the victim was that it was as a result of petitioner's arson.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.493" offset="16357334">Therefore, even in the verdict of the first jury, one has all the essential elements of first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="4073.168" offset="16395995">Now, the jury returned the verdict of second degree murder which they were told they might return.</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.222" offset="16436224">And in view of the mandatory death sentence and the fact that this is a very hard case, it is entirely reasonable to suppose that -- that considerations of -- of sympathy led the jury to return that verdict, but it is -- it is not realistic to say that the defendant was acquitted of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="4111.425" offset="16549073">Indeed, this Court has said with respect to the District of Columbia murder statute in the Fisher case that there is really but one crime of murder and that the difference between first degree murder and second degree murder really relate to the grades of punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="4149.978" offset="16703300">The first time, the verdict was simply guilty of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.381" offset="16724929">The second time, the jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder without capital punishment, the statute there being like the District of Columbia rape statute permitting the jury to make such a recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.154" offset="16776025">That conviction was reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4170.788" offset="16786474">The third time, the jury as did the first jury, returned a verdict of guilty of murder and the death penalty was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.595" offset="16825762">The contention was made to this Court that that was a violation of due process -- excuse me, a violation of double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.224" offset="16864319">And this Court wrote, "The only thing that the Appellate Court could do was to award a new trial on finding error in the proceeding."</text>
            <text syncTime="4199.120" offset="16899845">Thus, the plaintiff in error himself invoked the action of the Court which resulted in a further trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4206.039" offset="16927535">In such cases, he is not placed in second jeopardy within the meaning of the Constitution and the Court cited Trono.</text>
            <text syncTime="4218.891" offset="16978944">With respect to the questioning of -- of sentence, of -- of imposition of sentence by a trial judge, this Court wrote in Bozza against the United States in 330 U.S. that the Constitution does not require that sentencing should be a game in which a wrong move by the judge means immunity for the prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4241.990" offset="17071313">The Government submits here that that reasoning applies and that the wrong move by the judge, the instruction that the jury at the first trial could return a verdict of second degree murder should not confer an immunity upon the -- the petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="5640.225" offset="22664234">And that is that the defendant testified in this case and on the witness stand, acknowledged the truth of almost all of the statements concerning which there was testimony with respect to extra judicial admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5659.122" offset="22739884">Petitioner has relied on -- on two specific examples as being very prejudicial to the -- to his case, one was the denial of the -- by petitioner that he had written a very incriminating letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5675.760" offset="22806444">The petitioner testified at the trial that he had made that denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5681.871" offset="22830895">The other was -- was with respect to whether the petitioner had previously told the investigators that the deceased was discovered by him to have died a natural death before the fire occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="5697.184" offset="22892126">This testimony too was repeated by the defendant -- at -- at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5703.889" offset="22918980">He acknowledged that -- that this was true.</text>
            <text syncTime="5706.246" offset="22928384">That portion of the defendant's testimony is not reprinted in the printed transcript but it appears at pages 547 and 548 of the transcript of the entire trial which -- which is on file before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5723.890" offset="22998915">With respect to the -- the McNabb point, it's -- the objection at the trial court was not that the questioning occurred too late after two longer detentions but rather that it occurred too soon.</text>
            <text syncTime="5744.454" offset="23081148">On many occasions during the voir dire and throughout the trial, counsel for the petitioner waived any objection to testimony with respect to the 28th of May which was the third day of -- of his hospitalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5766.335" offset="23168711">And indeed, all of that -- all of the substantial allegations on the 28th were repeated by the defendant at the trial and acknowledged by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5779.951" offset="23223150">And so, the objection focused on the extra judicial statements made by the petitioner immediately after the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="5793.967" offset="23279261">In this connection, it is important to know that at the time of the first questioning at 8:30 on May 26, the petitioner was not under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5807.775" offset="23334431">The earliest stage at which it may be said that he was under police custody was subsequent to that because it was at the conclusion of that questioning that the call was made by the policeman to the precinct asking that -- that a policeman be -- be sent to, I think, look after this gentleman, was the language in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5832.298" offset="23432547">And in fact, that policeman had not arrived until after the -- the second questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="5841.814" offset="23470582">So, one does not have illegal detention nor any type of detention at the time of the first questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="5854.004" offset="23519378">And -- and all subsequent times, petitioners testimony was consistent with the statements which he made during that first question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5865.201" offset="23564204">In -- indeed he -- that was his story even at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5869.564" offset="23581654">It was a story to the effect that somehow, an unidentified man got into this house which was locked and barred.</text>
