            <label>Mr. Sand</label>
            <text syncTime="5.442" offset="21734">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.064" offset="32183">I would like to avert, if I may, to the question of double jeopardy and attempt to clarify the answers which I gave to the question asked by you Mr. Chief Justice and by Mr. Justices Frankfurter and -- and Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.346" offset="117342">I stated that there was no difference between the case where the verdict returned if one of guilt at second degree murder and the case where the verdict which the jury returned to one count and in -- and in an indictment of not guilty of first degree murder, guilty of second degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.938" offset="243670">There is no difference in legal consequence between those two cases under the view of the Trono case and under the view of the American Law Institute.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.675" offset="306678">But if we want to put to one side these cases, one could have cause distinguish between the cases where the jury is absolutely silent and the case where there is a specific finding of acquittal, where there is silence on the part of the jury, for example, that silence may be the result of disagreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.409" offset="425587">The jury -- there maybe a hung jury with respect to a particular degree of a crime and of course a hung jury has never in -- in recent times consort to be tantamount to an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.939" offset="479713">The jury may never have considered the -- that degree of the crime to which it returned no verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.319" offset="525270">The Government therefore went to some lengths in its brief to show that in no respect may this verdict of the jury at the first trial explicitly or implicitly be read as a finding of acquittal of first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.904" offset="623595">There was of course no such statement by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.959" offset="635820">The jury merely returned a verdict of guilt in -- in the second degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.073" offset="656196">We do know however from the other findings of the verdict -- of the jury with respect awesome count and with respect to the fact that the petitioner did cause the death of the victim that the jury found that in fact all the elements of the crime of first degree murder under the felony murder statute was satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.349" offset="757342">Therefore if -- if the rule which were to be adapted were one which were to distinguish between the case where the jury returned an explicit verdict of not guilty or acquittal and the case where it nearly returned a verdict of-- of a lesser included offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.854" offset="847412">This -- whether to be that distinction drawn, then this case clearly would not violate double jeopardy.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sand</label>
            <text syncTime="257.041" offset="1028075">I'm -- I'm aware that in some states, the practice is -- is to require that the various degrees be set forth in different counts, in which case there is a verdict returned in -- on each count.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.993" offset="1083873">That of course is -- is not the -- the federal fact --</text>

            <label>Justice Black</label>
            <text syncTime="275.763" offset="1102994">-- states that they charged murder in the first degree and they permit conviction all the way down to assault and battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.160" offset="1148552">Is there anything in your brief that could give us information on what is practically stated with reference to pleading the silence of the upper benches as exactly equivalent of a federal?</text>

            <label>Mr. Sand</label>
            <text syncTime="302.654" offset="1210514">Not in no terms Mr. Justice Black, but the question arises when there is an attempt to retry the defendant for the greater offense and of course it is clear that where there is a conviction for the less or an acquittal, for the lesser offense then retrial for the greater offense is precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.467" offset="1309780">The reason for that is that when there is the second trial for the greater offense, the defendant is in jeopardy on the lesser count.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.406" offset="1349590">Therefore, he is being placed twice in jeopardy for the lesser offense, the offense for which he was found guilty at -- at the first trial.</text>

            <label>Justice Black</label>
            <text syncTime="346.132" offset="1384490">Have you -- have you had any cases in your brief that indicates that that is rationalization to -- to call it jeopardy for the lesser offence?</text>
            <text syncTime="354.782" offset="1419076">I had supposed.</text>

            <label>Justice Black</label>
            <text syncTime="355.963" offset="1423778">Maybe I'm wrong, the reason why that he had been acquitted of a greater offense and he could not again be tried to that offense.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sand</label>
            <text syncTime="367.077" offset="1468291">The -- the -- that would be the rationale in -- in a limited way of a state, in a state which said that the effect of the conviction for the lesser included offense is -- is the effect of the reversal of such a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.590" offset="1542269">It's not to eradicate the entire judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.801" offset="1555122">That was -- is for example the reasoning of the -- of the state court in People against Stallings, recently specifically rejected by this Court in -- in the Trono decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.807" offset="1611128">My point and if I may state it again is that under the holdings of this case and -- and Trono and -- and then Brantley and under the view of the American Law Institute, it would make no difference whether the jury, with respect to a single count of the indictment, and that is the only situation we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.573" offset="1698273">We're not faced with the problem of multiple counts where of course this Court has said that different counts of an indictment are as if they were separate indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.805" offset="1743203">Where in response to the one count, the jury returns a verdict of -- in so many words, not guilty of first degree murder, guilty of second degree murder, but under the Trono case and the American Law Institute view, that would make no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.832" offset="1819272">Retrial for first degree murder would be permissible that the facts in Trono are -- are exactly that.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.954" offset="1855739">Where a distinction to be made between the two types of cases on the theory perhaps that where the jury is absolutely silent, we do not know whether they ever considered the count, whether they considered the count and did not agree or for any other reason, did not in fact pass upon the defendant's guilt of that degree of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.185" offset="1960647">And if the -- the rule to be annunciated by this Court in a case which presented such a problem where that such a finding would preclude retrial and under the facts of this case, it is clear that retrial for the greater offense would not be precluded because here, not only was there no finding by the jury of acquittal of the greater offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.775" offset="2071092">But by looking at the -- at the facts of -- of the -- the necessary implications of the verdicts returned at the first trial, we know that the jury found that the defendant was guilty of arson.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.026" offset="2132010">We know that the jury found that the victim died as a result of that arson.</text>

            <text syncTime="547.008" offset="2188016">Isn't it when the jury sworn and they proceed to try the case and unless -- unless the case is interrupted in the middle of it because of some unusual circumstance that -- that would bring about injustice, the man has been placed in jeopardy?</text>

            <text syncTime="622.055" offset="2488216">It is one error here of permitting the jury to return a verdict to second degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.162" offset="2508591">It was not the reversal only of so much of the error has -- has prejudiced the petitioner, but the perpetuation of so much of the error as operated to his benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.265" offset="2552999">Here, were the error not -- had the error not been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.416" offset="2581629">We do not know what that first jury would have done, but we have -- we have a good idea by virtue of the fact that there was a retrial with the same evidence and in the absence of that error there was a verdict of guilty of first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.684" offset="2642651">This error prejudiced both -- both the -- both the defendant and the governor -- and the Government in the words of -- of Mr. Justice Douglas in the safer case, it tainted the entire verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.893" offset="2703569">In no sense therefore can that verdict a part from the error which was the very error which caused the reverse he said to represent an acquittal of -- of the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="853.309" offset="3413159">Retrial would violate double jeopardy on that now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.648" offset="3438550">The facts in this case are very peculiar because the theory of the reversal was that there could only be -- this could only be the greater offense because we know from the verdict of the jury at the first trial that they found in fact all the elements of felony and murder because the nature of the error which was a single error tainted the entire verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.032" offset="3568118">One might have for instance, the case where a defendant is on trial for a first degree murder and is convicted of man -- manslaughter or it is convicted of second degree murder and there was an error at the trial with respect to the difference between second degree murder and manslaughter where the nature of the error did not in any way touch the greater offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.446" offset="3681698">It is conceivable there that the court would hold that where the error was of such a nature, so that it obviously do not affect the jury's deliberation with respect to the first degree murder count, that they would then be found an implicit acquittal of first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.406" offset="3797577">I'm not urging that rule on this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="955.006" offset="3819938">It would be a rational rule, but that is not this case, because here, the very error which led to the reversal was the error which -- which prejudiced both the Government the defendant and lead to the juries returning a verdict on second degree murder.</text>

            <text syncTime="2673.779" offset="10695053">If the Court of Appeals had shared Mr. Sand's certainty as to what went wrong in the minds of the jury, they would have been reversing solely for the benefit of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.336" offset="10737267">Mr. Sand's argument that Green claiming his course of conduct, constituted first degree murder and that his second degree of conviction should be set aside because of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.438" offset="10789721">Ignores what the Court of Appeals held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.035" offset="10800065">They held that the second degree charge was not an invitation to the jury to compromise so much as it was an invitation for the jury to convict Mr. Green of a crime which he hadn't committed, a crime for which there was no evidence in that record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.730" offset="10882821">Now, that is perhaps a delicate question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.186" offset="10896718">Just what exactly was on this charge?</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.359" offset="10905391">What could it signify?</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.858" offset="10911347">I should like to read to the Court, part of the charge given at the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.182" offset="10944679">The statute means that if a person kills another in the perpetration of an arson or attempting to perpetrate an arson, the killing is murder in the first degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.182" offset="10988669">Under such circumstances, it doesn't make any difference whether the killing was committed with or without purpose so to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.820" offset="11019180">Any killing even if committed without any purpose so to do, even if it is accidental and it is committed in perpetrating an arson is murder in the first degree under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.955" offset="11067768">That charge -- then there was a second degree charge which just said if you find that he killed her without premeditation, he may return a verdict to second degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.570" offset="11118237">But, there had been a serious challenge to the manner of Ms. Brown's death raised by defense counsel at the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.958" offset="11163794">The Government has not produced the doctor who made the test of Ms. Brown's blood and upon that blood test, rested the Government's point that Ms. Brown had died as a result of the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.505" offset="11221995">The prosecuting attorney took this attack on their testimony at the first trial, seriously enough to call this witness at the second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.150" offset="11260552">He believed that he should proceed against Green with this witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.135" offset="11276539">If we -- if this Court is to speculate about what went on in the minds of the jurors, we think it is not to be disregarded that they might have felt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.659" offset="11322619">We don't know how Green killed Ms. Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.798" offset="11339128">We can't tell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.315" offset="11345189">The defense attorney certainly made a fuss about whether or not the Government can prove she inhaled smoke and died.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.702" offset="11374759">And the judge told us if we thought she died in the fire that we had to return first degree, but there were the two of them in that house and one of them was dead and the other one we feel committed arson and we feel he told us a lie about an intruder coming in and stabbing him with an ice pick.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.609" offset="11454380">So -- and also, he is on trial for killing her.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.690" offset="11466710">There must be something in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.074" offset="11476219">We don't know how he did it, but we can just find him guilty of second degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.244" offset="11488967">The judge told us if we thought he killed her and didn't mean to do it, it wasn't premeditated, that's second degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.117" offset="11512372">Well, that's the speculation that's possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.986" offset="11523866">We're getting to a great deal of trouble when we start to speculate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.603" offset="11546331">I should like to also comment a bit about the idea that this charge was very unfair to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.774" offset="11583007">The prosecuting attorney sat on his hands when the second degree charge went to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.516" offset="11602024">In fact, in his summation to jury, he told them that second degree charge will be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.123" offset="11624490">Now, if this Court holds that by appealing that erroneous lesser conviction, Green's subjected himself properly to retrial on the greater charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.721" offset="11674854">You are creating a lovely situation for prosecutors in difficult cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.421" offset="11693662">We submit the prosecutor let the second degree charge go to the jury because he was afraid that jury might not convict on first degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.222" offset="11724800">This was a rather sympathetic defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.462" offset="11737757">And we submit that if you hold the way the Government wishes you to hold in this case, you will leave prosecutors in the driver seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.095" offset="11768372">They can let the lesser erroneous charge go to the jury securing a knowledge that they will get a conviction or they have a better chance of getting a conviction, otherwise, they wouldn't let it go.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.156" offset="11820617">And if they -- if the defendant is rush enough to appeal that conviction, the Government will have another chance adding on the greater charge which they couldn't prove for which they had enough doubt about so that they let the lesser go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.990" offset="11879863">Now, sure there was a benefit to Green in a way from the second degree charge, we don't deny that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.511" offset="11905985">It is possible that the Government's speculation maybe true in fact although improper as a matter of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.048" offset="11940153">But who is to bear the burden in a situation like this, the defendant or the state?</text>
