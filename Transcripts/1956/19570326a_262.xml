            <label>Mr. David E. Feller</label>
            <text syncTime="15.201" offset="164133">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.287" offset="176567">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.027" offset="191509">When we -- Your Honors will recall that this is the second of three cases involving the question of whether under Section 301, a union may bring suit to enforce the agreement of the employer to arbitrate grievances arising during the term of that agreement concerning the interpretation and application of that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.747" offset="298402">When I finished yesterday, I think I was going over the Senate Committee Report to what have -- the Senate said as to the meaning of Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.674" offset="346049">I was unfortunately didn't have it with me at the moment, but today I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.659" offset="369977">And I would like to continue to illustrate what I think is the critical question here and that is this, that although the legislative history of 301 is very unclear in many aspects, precisely, the state of the law that Congress meant to create is very uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.597" offset="449808">There is one thing that is clear and that is that the objective of Section 301 was to ensure that where you had contracts which had the kind of promise, which is involved in these cases, that is the grievances will be arbitrated, will be handled through the grievance procedure and that there will not be strikes as a method of policing the enforcement of the contract that where you had that kind of a cause, there should not be strikes and legal remedy should be provided to ensure that there would be labor peace during the term of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.561" offset="609573">Now, how you get to the result is another question which I will come to, but I want to reiterate again and quote from the Senate Committee report that see they drive of what they were trying to accomplish in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.385" offset="672893">And I'm quoting from Senate Report Number 105 which is the report on the statute which eventually got enacted because the Senate version rather than the House version is different only in language and in one other respect which I'll come to later.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.139" offset="739976">The Senate Committee Report, the first sentence, in dealing with these whole things says, “The committee bill makes collective bargaining contracts equally binding and enforceable on both parties."</text>
            <text syncTime="172.619" offset="793893">This is their topical sentence in which they're telling you what they're doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.038" offset="811551">They are making these contracts, binding and enforceable on both parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.697" offset="838196">And they go on to say, that this is in according with the purpose of the Wagner Act which required the parties to bargaining with each other, quoting from this Court, describing the Wagner Act, “to the end that an employment contract binding on both party should be made.”</text>
            <text syncTime="203.676" offset="918026">Then they go on to discuss the difficulties that have been involved in suing unions and I will -- there's no question that one of the problems they had was the difficulty in suing unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.601" offset="961808">But the reason they were concerned with the difficulty in suing unions again was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.544" offset="981556">It says that -- that “If these contracts are not enforceable, you will not "promote industrial peace."</text>
            <text syncTime="229.670" offset="1022098">The chief advantage and the purpose of having a collective bargaining agreement is to ensure that you will have peace during the term of that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.116" offset="1055848">After discussing the procedural difficulties and other difficulties, I will say that there's a misconception that the difficulty was only procedural.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.055" offset="1091584">Really, the -- the principal difficulty in suing unions was not procedural as it is illustrated in the New York law where there is a statute making organizations, unincorporated association suable in their common name where you can get service on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.954" offset="1151143">But the substantive law of the State that since these organizations are not legal entities, all you get when you sue a union in its common name is in fact a suit against all the members and you can't recover for a breach of a collective bargaining agreement unless all of the members are -- are guilty of that breach, because the union per se is not a legal person.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.790" offset="1246542">In other words, they have construed their suit statute as a procedural suit, statute only not changing the substantive rule of liability with the respect to one incorporated associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.631" offset="1297847">They discussed all of these difficulties, difficulties in the touching union assets even where you can sue in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.163" offset="1324074">And they say, “We want to make sure that both parties can sue effectively to -- to enforce collective bargaining agreements to the end that you will have industrial peace.”</text>
            <text syncTime="319.409" offset="1381021">And they say that there are no -- now, no federal law and this is a quote."</text>
            <text syncTime="323.466" offset="1397217">There are no federal laws giving either an employer or even the Government itself any right of action for any breach of these contracts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="332.429" offset="1433057">Thus, there is no quote, "substantive right" to enforce in order to make the union suable as such in federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.356" offset="1476838">And then, they conclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.449" offset="1485197">Statutory recognition of the collective agreement as a valid binding and enforceable contract is a logical and necessary step.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.816" offset="1530650">It will promote a higher degree of responsibility upon the parties to such agreements and will thereby promote industrial peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.797" offset="1566595">Now, they were talking about no-strike clause, the no-strike arbitration provision which are really the same clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.329" offset="1596688">Because their next goal to meet the objection that if they do this, unions won't agree to no-strike arbitration clauses anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.820" offset="1638693">If unions are responsible in damages and these suits can be brought and there is this statutory recognition of these contracts as enforceable contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.743" offset="1678294">But they answered that by saying, “This argument isn't supported, in the few States which have enacted laws, making these contracts enforceable in the Courts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="404.135" offset="1719881">Four States they say, “Minnesota, Colorado, Wisconsin and California, have enacted those laws.”</text>
            <text syncTime="409.412" offset="1740988">And as far as they can determine, there has been no decrease in the incidence of no-strike clauses in union contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.084" offset="1771708">And therefore, they conclude that there would not be any decrease in the incidence of union of no-strike clauses if Congress gave the statutory recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.101" offset="1823744">Now, concededly, the question of whether an agreement to arbitrate can be specifically enforced was not discussed anywhere, one way or the other in the legislative history of Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.566" offset="1885602">I think that it is -- it necessarily follows from the purpose which Congress was trying to achieve in 301 that the agreements which exists in 90% of our collective bargaining agreements today that when an employer takes action, he assigns a man do a shift or doesn't assign him do a shift.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.567" offset="1973687">He gives him a promotion or he doesn't give him a promotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.948" offset="1987166">And the man says, "This is in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement."</text>
            <text syncTime="476.461" offset="2009213">The characteristics of all, of 90% of American collective bargaining agreements is that the man does what he -- what he's told to, and I think this is almost universal, and he files a grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.805" offset="2062608">Now, in this contract, it said that these grievances shall not be the subject of a strike, but that they will be handled through the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.083" offset="2103672">First discussion with this form and then discussion with the departmental superintendent with the shop -- the Departmental Steward then at a higher level between representatives of the International Union and representatives of top management, and if they don't agree on the question then it goes to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.730" offset="2166262">You do not achieve the purpose of promoting industrial peace if you say that this agreement is not enforceable as Congress said it should be in Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.563" offset="2221641">Now, we derived some additional comfort from the history, which was mentioned briefly yesterday of the unfair labor practice proposal in the legislative history of the 1947 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.947" offset="2295202">In the Senate Bill, it was proposed to put in Section 301 substantially in the form on which it now exists, but also to insert an unfair labor practice provision providing that it would be an unfair labor practice to violate the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="688.387" offset="2856939">It was precisely as now the -- the minority in the Senate Committee said, “Hear now, If you're going to make this an unfair labor practice, you're going to have two bodies deciding the same question.”</text>
            <text syncTime="703.060" offset="2915662">You're going to have the Courts deciding questions and you're going to have the National Labor Relations Board deciding the same question.</text>

            <text syncTime="722.914" offset="2995075">Now, before I go on, let me make it clear that if the unfair labor practice provision had been enacted, there is no question that you would get specific enforcement, not because they talked about the question but because the National Labor Relations Board by its very nature issues cease-and-desist orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.282" offset="3064456">It's not an -- it tells you what to do in the future.</text>

            <text syncTime="1001.439" offset="4109145">Today, we talked about them as contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.638" offset="4121893">I think that Congress at the minimum, and I don't have to go very much beyond that minimum in this case, meant to say that you have a place to go and in that place, you will regard this document as a binding contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.376" offset="4192841">That's the only issue of substantive law which I think they discussed because they said they've intended to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.118" offset="4223875">And they said it should be an enforceable contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.746" offset="4238399">Now, there are other States, in Kansan for example, a contract, a collective bargaining agreement is not a contract at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1044.035" offset="4279463">In Young against Canadian Railways, the Privy Council said that this is simply a statement by the employer as to what rules he will apply and if he doesn't apply them, the appropriate remedy by the union is to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.128" offset="4335888">Now, precisely, what they wanted to do in 301 is to say it is that they wanted to give statutory recognition to the collective bargaining agreement as a contract of itself, not a contract of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.436" offset="4393148">This is a contract between the union, an enforceable contract between the union as union and the employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1098.874" offset="4498892">I think under the laws of the States, assuming a collective bargaining agreement is a -- is a contract, these provisions, agreements to arbitrate are valid agreements.</text>

            <text syncTime="1515.207" offset="6164250">Now, in our view, I -- before we got off on the questions, I was talking about the unfair labor practice provisions of the Act, which was objected to in the Senate Committee because the Senate Committee, the minority felt that there would be conflict if they allow both an unfair labor practice proceeding before the board and a suit for breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.240" offset="6272293">The bill was passed in the Senate and went to conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.390" offset="6284936">And there, the House conferees made the same objection and then Senator Taft explained it when the Conference Report came back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.123" offset="6331852">The House conferees objected to this provision, the unfair labor practice provision which in the report had been said was an additional provision to the -- to the principle of remedy given which was the right to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.010" offset="6383365">On the ground, it would have the effect of making the terms of collective bargaining agreement subject to interpretation and determination by the Board rather than by the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.015" offset="6423385">That's the reason they've objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.828" offset="6434670">Senator Taft said in concurrence with their view, “If both provisions had remained, there could have been a probable conflict of remedies and decisions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.210" offset="6480227">And therefore, they decided to eliminate the unfair labor practice provision and allow the Section 301 to remain in the statute so you would not have two bodies deciding the same question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.986" offset="6535293">And they said that in this way, "This is the House Conference Report."</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.934" offset="6547101">Now, I had quoted from Senator Taft, "Once parties have made a collective bargaining contract, the enforcement of that contract should be left to the usual process of law and not to the National Labor Relations Board.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.016" offset="6591404">In other words, the duty to bargain, the relationship between the parties as they got into the bargaining question representation, leave that to the Board.Once they have a contract, let him sue in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.987" offset="6639365">Now, if this legislative history means anything, it means that there was not the slightest recognition on anybody's part that there would be this vast difference in result which would occur if this Court should say that there can be no specific performance of the -- of the agreement to arbitrate that that remedy is not available in the suit under 301 because in time, it would have been available if there had been an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.509" offset="6769455">And I submit there has not the slightest suggestion in the Committee Report that they did anything other than decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.156" offset="6792025">There should not be two forms to justify the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.226" offset="6808325">And they decided for reasons best known to themselves that they'd rather have us be in Court than before the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.914" offset="6843016">Now, I think in the course of this discussion, I have made it fairly clear that all we say here on the substance versus procedure where you look for the substantive law, all we say here is that as a matter of federal law, it must be held consistent with what Congress intended under Section 301 that the agreement to arbitrate can be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.125" offset="6959835">And that's all we say.</text>

            <text syncTime="1737.380" offset="7052936">Now of course, we'd be very happy if this Court said to the contrary and not in this case generally, but I think it's fairly clear that unions opposed Section 301.</text>

            <text syncTime="1759.710" offset="7142170">We never got passed one District Judge on the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.498" offset="7157321">A couple of Courts of Appeals dismissed the argument abruptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.620" offset="7173831">We are being sued for breach of precisely and can be sued for breach of precisely this kind of a provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.726" offset="7202252">Now, how can you have a position of law that you haven't signed a contract for two years?</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.914" offset="7227016">It says, “The employer manages the plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="1785.575" offset="7245720">You agree and you have to go through the agreements and arbitration procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.216" offset="7268185">If you strike, you can be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.134" offset="7279888">But on the other hand, if the employer refuses to arbitrate, you can't sue to get relief for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.447" offset="7309145">And that would be precisely the posture that would be created in the great majority of States which do not enforce agreements to arbitrate because they do not give that remedy of negligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2160.239" offset="8744312">The problems are problems of abstraction and not problems of reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.001" offset="8763329">And I take for an example the question put by Mr. Orr yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.134" offset="8783914">If the employer went to arbitration here, and it was decided that the vacation pay wasn't due, he said, “The individuals could turn around and sue in the state court to collect their vacation pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.981" offset="8839293">Obviously, that isn't so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.523" offset="8849429">But why isn't it so?</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.144" offset="8863953">Because of the National Labor Relations Act, not vague provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, specific provisions of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.761" offset="8902405">The specific provision in the National Labor Relations Act which enabled the union to represent the employee and have each decision binding on the employee is the fact that in Section 9 (a) of the Act, congress said that union shall be the exclusive collective bargaining agency for employees in appropriate unit where a majority so designated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.763" offset="8994461">And Congress in Section 8 (d) said that “Collective bargaining includes the negotiation of a contract and the negotiation of questions arising under the contract.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.144" offset="9043989">Now, if any suit is brought in any Court in which this kind of question is raised, there is no question that it has to be resolved and should be resolved in terms of the specific provisions of the National Labor Relations Act or take another case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.425" offset="9113057">An employer goes to an employee and says, “I like you to work overtime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.755" offset="9130402">You can use the extra money, but how about us making the deal that we won't pay you the overtime rights -- rates specified in the union contract?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.619" offset="9165824">This case is a risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.309" offset="9176586">The employee does the work and then sues for breach of the collective bargaining agreement for breach of his right to overtime pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.229" offset="9216293">What law governs?</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.113" offset="9223816">Again, it is perfectly clear that the National Labor Relations Act, when it said that there shall be collective bargaining, and as this Court has held outlaws individual bargains in derogation of the collective bargain which the union has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.428" offset="9285047">That is the law which must govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.103" offset="9295809">There are -- virtually, every question of law as to which there could be a body of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.228" offset="9316289">I'm not talking about interpretation of words in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.596" offset="9325798">That's a question of law in some sense but not a question in which there is a body of state or federal law to which we refer to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.068" offset="9351607">Virtually, every kind of question which arises under a collective bargaining agreement has reference to specific provisions in the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.222" offset="9392253">Is a contract a valid contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.402" offset="9401031">The National Labor Relations Board decides that question every Monday, Wednesday and Friday in determining whether to hold elections, union security clause with a check off provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.889" offset="9438960">If you sue for the dues while the National Labor Relations Act has specific provisions saying, “What kind of union security clause you can have,” and specifically gives to the State certain rights in regard to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.691" offset="9486085">The National Labor Relations Board is constantly saying, “Contracts are not bars to new elections because the contract -- this contract provision is not in conformity with the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.805" offset="9522552">But I would hesitate to go forward with this, but there is no question that in suits for breach of contract, a question where there is a contract, whether it's a valid contract who's bound by it besides of the bargaining unit would determine who's bound by it are determined always, have to be determined in reference to the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.680" offset="9598098">This Section 301 is part of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.337" offset="9616697">It's a compliment to the whole procedure requiring the parties to bargain, setting forth their duties to bargain which include not only the negotiation of a contract but the settlement of differences under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.352" offset="9660792">It's all set aligned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.601" offset="9665808">And I think -- in this connection, I want to make perfectly clear, but I think Mr. Goldberg made clear yesterday in an answer to the question about the union loan to an employer that on mature consideration, we would not regard that as within the scope of Section 301, no more than if a union made a contract to build a building with a contractor who is an employer, who had employees, who are engaged in commerce and the union obviously represents the employees that this building contract would be subject to 301.</text>

            <text syncTime="2652.002" offset="10711333">Section 4 of the Act contains certain provision, certain types of activities which can never be enjoined in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.296" offset="10748531">You can't enjoin a strike, picketing, assistance, a list of areas of conflict which these -- where the Courts were to stay out of in the absence of fraud or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.463" offset="10801194">Now, it's conceded that Section 4 has no application here because we're not asking for any of the forbidden kind of injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.524" offset="10825435">Section 7 says that “In cases that no injunction shall be issued except upon certain finding.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.004" offset="10867440">Now, the Committee Reports, a far date of predeceases in this field make it perfectly clear that Section 7 was a procedural section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.402" offset="10904952">It was designed to setup a -- put procedural safeguards and if read in connection with Section 4, again, it is perfectly clear they're talking about the cases in which an injunction would be barred under Section 4, except for allegations of fraud or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.392" offset="10972975">And this is the way you show the violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.420" offset="10981021">You saw that police can't protect you and you put in all the requisites.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.406" offset="10997008">Since Section 4 has no application, we think that Section 7, the procedural section in which you prove the exception before has no application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.193" offset="11028146">I think this is -- it makes sense of all this Court's decision under the Railway Labor Act and the implied decisions in the Hoffman case and what?</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.611" offset="11061791">Mutuality, I want to say one word about the mutuality because I know it will be mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.488" offset="11081331">If as we said the Norris-La Guardia Act prevents an injunction against a strike and I think even in violation of a contract, I have to make this perfectly fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.165" offset="11132008">Isn't it unfair for us to command and ask for an injunction, injunctive relief, equitable relief to enforce the agreement to arbitrate when they can't enjoin us from striking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.364" offset="11180805">Are they going to say that and that's a perfectly legitimate argument which Judge Magruder managed in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.288" offset="11208495">The answer is I think very plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.050" offset="11223542">They have a remedy in damages, very substantial damages, as I can testify and this court records can testify for breach of contract in the case of a strike and violation of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.271" offset="11268472">Congress decided they should not have an equitable remedy when it refused to repeal the Norris-La Guardia Act as it affects these statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.481" offset="11309328">But the union has no remedy, unless it can get equitable relief, because damages do not lie and cannot in their nature to lie to enforce the agreement to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.985" offset="11351333">Now, my white light is on and I want to go to the Arbitration Act very fast.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.439" offset="11369096">The Arbitration Act, which was passed in 1924, was meant to go as far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.522" offset="11397413">The Committee Reports plainly reveal that they meant to exhaust the commerce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.099" offset="11419773">So, transaction is a -- a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce in Section 2 of the Act, I think involving commerce has to be read as affecting commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="2875.803" offset="11606601">Second, the exemption in Section 1 of contracts of employment, this is a very curious thing because this exemption was the creature of one man, Andrew Furuseth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.537" offset="11669504">There's no question that this exemption was inserted at the request of the International Seamen's Union and it is so stated in the hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.728" offset="11710255">And it is always been assumed that since unions as to exempt contracts of employment, what they were talking about were collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.222" offset="11756231">And I think due to counsel for the company in General Electric, the next case who indicated that the source material was available, everybody is going to the proceedings of the International Seamen's Union and investigated the International Seamen's Union and try to find out what Mr. Furuseth was talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.752" offset="11826343">And he was talking about one thing, shipping orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.350" offset="11840763">The individual contracts of employment which every sailor has to sign which as of the time, this statute was passed, it had arbitration clauses in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.943" offset="11879111">And under the Maritime Law, a seaman has the right to leave a ship under certain conditions and Mr. Furuseth said, “They're going to arbitrate before a shipping commissioner on your right and they're going to make you stay on your ship, and they're going to deprive your right to go to law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.521" offset="11937416">They were talking about what they said they were talking, and that is contracts of employment, the kind of contract you have in the Barnhart case where you don't have a union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.098" offset="11975764">An agreement to serve in the Seamen's Union in a resolution entitled “compulsory labor,” said that “If I man signs these articles, he will be compelled to serve and stay on the ship,” and therefore we oppose this bill as it was introduced.</text>
