            <label>Mr. Blow</label>
            <text syncTime="17.730" offset="70844">May it please the Court, this case is here upon writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.315" offset="109192">It began over four years ago when a fire was discovered at the petitioner's residence on Massachusetts Avenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.159" offset="148584">Now it was May 26, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.020" offset="164049">Upon their arrival at the burning house, the fireman found two people present in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.013" offset="192052">One was the petitioner who was found evidently unconscious, lying in the basement bathtub of his house and the other was the deceased Ms. Bettie Brown, who was pronounced dead on being taken out of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.837" offset="263314">The petitioner was taken out of the house, was administered oxygen, was taken to emergency hospital and was there laid upon an examining table.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.728" offset="306887">That was approximately 9 a.m. on the morning of May 26, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.564" offset="342204">Now between that period and 10 o'clock on the morning of May 28, the defendant was questioned intermittently by two officers of the homicide squad of the Metropolitan Police Department and by the inspector of the Fire Department in-charge of the investigating causes of arson.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.836" offset="443246">And since this house was locked and all windows secured when the firemen arrived, and since there were evidently five or six separate fires, the evidence or the information of any officer investigating this fire was that arson had been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.804" offset="531122">At any rate, on May 28th at approximately 10 -- 11 o'clock in the morning, the defendant was taken before the Deputy Coroner and advised in accordance with Rule 5(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that he had a right not to make a statement, that any statement he used might be used against him, that he had a right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.593" offset="634358">Soon after this, the Grand Jury met and returned an indictment against the petitioner in two counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.961" offset="679811">Now the first -- this indictment is on pages two and three of the record and it's vitally important, because the first count read, “on or about May 26, 1953 within the District of Columbia, Everett D. Green maliciously did burn and cause to be burnt a building known as 1115 Massachusetts Avenue North West property of Gerald Green” and the second count incorporated that language, and it read, “on or about May 26, 1953 within the District of Columbia, Everett D. Green committed the offense of arson, that is to say, he maliciously did burn or caused to be burnt a certain building known as 1115 Massachusetts Avenue North West, property of Gerald Green; and in perpetration of the offense of arson aforesaid caused Bettie Brown to inhale certain gas, the inhalation of which resulted in her death within the District of Columbia on or about May 26, 1953.”</text>
            <text syncTime="246.047" offset="984085">Thus, while the first count charged the petitioner with the offense of arson under Section 401 of the District of Columbia Code, the second count charged him with two offenses, one the same arson and two the offense of arson killing as defined in Section 2401 of the District Code which provides, whoever being of sound memory or discretion without purpose so to do, kills another in perpetrating or in attempting to perpetrate any arson, as defined in Section 401 of this code is guilty of murder in the first degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.671" offset="1174674">Now the petitioner was tried upon this two count indictment and the jury was instructed on the law of arson and they were instructed that if they found in the perpetration of this arson the deceased died through the inhalation of certain gases produced by fumes, they were to return a verdict of first degree murder under the District of Columbia Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.837" offset="1299331">The judge, on his own motion, instructed the jury on second degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.735" offset="1334857">Now the jury retired and they came back and they found, “we find the defendant Everett D. Green guilty of arson, we find the defendant guilty of second degree murder on the second count.”</text>
            <text syncTime="345.598" offset="1382296">The arson stand, it was never appealed and the sentence one the arson now has been served.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.633" offset="1430465">But he did appeal his conviction of second degree murder and in his appeal he urged that there was no evidence in the record of his trial that would sustain a conviction of second degree murder and he urged that the giving of that instruction permitted the government, permitted the jury rather to resolve any doubt that they may have had as to the cause of the death of the deceased in the favor of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.667" offset="1582602">And the Court of Appeals in reversing said one, the giving of the second degree murder instruction where there is no evidence to warrant it, is technically erroneous; two it was prejudicial because here and I quote, “Here had the erroneous instruction under which he was convicted not been given, Green might have been found not guilty under the second count.”</text>
            <text syncTime="428.095" offset="1712379">The case was remanded to the District Court and once it became evident that the government was going to proceed the second time, under first degree murder charge, the defendant interposed a plea a former jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.970" offset="1779879">That plea being overruled he was tried the second time and convicted this time of first degree murder as originally charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.801" offset="1823138">Now, we contend that the government was not privileged to prove a second time what it had been unable to prove before the first jury and to support this contention we have briefed four arguments, two of these are constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.904" offset="1943615">The first proceeds from the fact that the petitioner was in undoubted jeopardy of his life on the offense of first degree arson and murder at his first trial, and this argument concerned the extent of the waiver of the defense of former jeopardy that is going to be presumed to attach to the exercise of an appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1060.670" offset="4242599">Well, we have our third point which we are going to discuss and that relates to the principles of collateral estoppel as set forth in recent decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.090" offset="4288261">It leaves aside constitutional concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.524" offset="4302054">We are going to make the argument that the government was barred from -- by collateral estoppel, from attempting a second time to prove what they couldn't prove the first time, and finally we are going to talk about jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.768" offset="4374988">We are going to say that when the Court was granted appellate power over criminal cases, then at that time we look to the state of the law in the common law of court, and that time it was 1889.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.879" offset="4467461">And was then -- of course these arguments all rejected we come to question of whether or not if there was to be a second trial, it was a fair trial and in that connection we mentioned statements admitted, statements that the police and fire department inspectors in the case admitted which we think are properly excludable under the McNabb Rule and we call to this Court's attention, certain remarks which were made by the prosecutor in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.672" offset="4586684">Now turning to the first point, we have to mention and this is in connection with our effort to find some sort of intent on the part of the framers of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.715" offset="4650841">We have to say that at the time of the Constitution, new trials so far as our research discloses were not granted in England in capital cases and probably not in felony cases generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.067" offset="4724193">So -- and this explains the decision in United States versus Gibert, as many years as 36 or more, after the Constitution that there could be no new trial because such a new trial would place a man twice in jeopardy and the Constitution said he couldn't be placed twice in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.474" offset="4817816">In England as we understand it, the prisoners' remedy was to call the error of the lack of evidence to the attention of the crown and in this sometimes he would evidently be carefully insisted by the Trial Court, but there is no question of a new trial if he was right then that was the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.818" offset="4911229">We said or the Court said in the Gibert case that there couldn't be a new trial at all, but in the Federal Courts, we have no appellate procedures in these criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.862" offset="4975386">And we had no real understanding perhaps of what problems would be involved if the new trial were granted and yet the defendant had been convicted at the first trial of an offense lesser in degree than that with which he was charged in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.057" offset="5056157">And we say in that connection that is where we looked to our states Your Honor and we look to the states for an interpretation of the Constitution or the -- the common law prohibition against second jeopardy because they had some sort of appellate procedure and they have this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.037" offset="5172140">And they said we are going to expand the constitutional right, but we are not, we are not going to leave it in its contracted form, we are going to expand it for the benefit of the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.601" offset="5218325">But we are not going to go so far as to say that an appeal will waive what the protection that the guy had by virtue of his not having been found guilty of the higher charge on the first time around.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.146" offset="5304529">In other words, we are not going to make a man barter, or gamble when he appeals or when he decides to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.334" offset="5341309">We, in our brief, have distinguished the rule that obtained or could obtain in Territorial Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.330" offset="5393241">And we have distinguished, we have attempted to distinguish the rule that obtained and was applied by this Court in Trono versus the United States where we had a system of law that developed not from the common law, but from the Spanish law where there was no trial by jury and where as Trono was -- he was tried by magistrate, a trial magistrate without a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.397" offset="5513509">The case was appealed in accordance with procedures established by Congress to the Supreme Court of the (Inaudible) and his conviction was reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.502" offset="5561992">Without remanding the case at all, a new determination of facts was made by the appellate court, a new offense was found to have been committed and a new sentence was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.621" offset="5610475">Well this is an entirely foreign procedure to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.089" offset="5636284">And one of the justices, Justice Brown who concurred in the opinion of this Court of Mr. Justice Peckham in affirming those convictions said, one year earlier in Kepner he made it clear and he wasn't going to trust a trial magistrate in the Philippines with a final power of acquitting a defendant charged with a serious offence such as murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.643" offset="5750491">And he said, again, it's logical I think to assume that he conferred in Trono for the same reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.700" offset="5778704">He felt this was a proper procedure and the contracts and the history of Philippine law of territorial, of a territorial court established by act of Congress, the government of Philippine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.750" offset="5838994">But given the logic of Trono in the Philippines, you have four dissenters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.211" offset="5888836">And those dissenters found as did the majority, as did the four in the majority, there were four in them all found some sort of acquittal, inherent in the finding of the lower offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.500" offset="5961979">Now they have admitted as all eight of them proceeding on the assumption that the question was one of waiver of a right, in that case a legislative right that it was regarded as the constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.122" offset="6028434">The court below, the Court of Appeals in this case has approached the entire case from a standpoint of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.491" offset="6057900">Perhaps with the exception of Mr. Justice, of Judge Prettyman you could say safely that that eight of the Court of Appeals below were attacking this present case on the ground of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.671" offset="6122684">And we have applied here by the majority of the Court of Appeals a presumptive absolute waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.335" offset="6157270">The man has been presumed to have surrendered the protection of the Constitution in exchange for the exercise of a statutory right through appeal what he regarded as an unjust verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.182" offset="6232712">Now we have our question of the lesser included offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.106" offset="6264372">We take a look at Rule 31(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.306" offset="6277224">We say that a man maybe convicted of any offense lesser than necessarily included in that charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.724" offset="6318811">We take a look at this indictment and we take a look at ours and we see that count one is reproduced word for word in count two and that count two adds on a one element to the events described, the consequent there -- that that's consequent upon the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.413" offset="6417554">Now this Court, the government in its brief, the court below, everyone recognized that the test that has been applied consistently by this Court is that in Murray versus Commonwealth which – wherein it was stated if each statute requires proof of a fact which the other does not, an acquittal or conviction under either statute does not exempt the defendant from prosecution and punishment of the guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.229" offset="6556839">But of course here only one did, you can't say the count one required anything more than count two, it was a lesser included offense in the count two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.498" offset="6609920">The trouble with this whole thing was pointed out in the Trial Court where the judge handed the indictment of the jury and said you will disregard count one, charged in count two.</text>

            <text syncTime="1710.998" offset="6843977">He said it was wrong to assume that any man would consciously waive something like a fundamental constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.680" offset="6878668">Well we say that Justice Holmes was tackling this problem in a way that would permit a new trial continually no matter who was prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.633" offset="6942511">The object being to get a trial free from error, it made no difference we understand from Justice Holmes' position of waiver whether it was the government was hurt or the prisoner, if one was hurt there should be a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.546" offset="7010116">Now our answer to Justice Holmes' argument has to be that that is not the law that the government is not permitted an appeal --</text>

            <text syncTime="2121.880" offset="8487497">Leaving aside for a very quick moment, the constitutional concern, we refer to the rule which this Court had occasion to examine in Yates versus United States that and I quote, “a party may be precluded under the doctrine of collateral estoppel from attempting a second time to prove a fact that he sought unsuccessfully to prove in a prior action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.022" offset="8608078">Now this Court has agreed that the non-existence of a fact as well as its existence can constitute -- can be established by a judgment and in the instant case it must be kept in mind throughout that the government had a clear crack at the defendants the first time before 12 competent jurors and it didn't succeed in proving the (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.677" offset="8730645">And I think it's fair to say from that that the first verdict which was silent on the subject of arson killing required as a determination of mixed fact and law, those magic words, essential to be the decision, the finding that death had not been caused in the manner alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.154" offset="8824581">Now that is true even -- at the same time you can say that the conviction of second degree meant by looking at the jury's reaction is one properly interpreting its instruction as a specific finding that he committed that he killed her in some other way, but we don't press that as hard as we do the silence of the jury of the fact that the government couldn't prove its case once and did the second time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2289.128" offset="9156441">This Court has said again and again that we don't care how contradictory, how irrationally conflicting verdicts maybe (Inaudible) different times because nobody can pursue the mind of a jury and know why they did, what they did.</text>

            <text syncTime="2306.753" offset="9226971">That is correct Your Honor, and we subscribe wholeheartedly to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.972" offset="9251840">Now finally so far as propriety of a second trial is concerned we look to the statute which granted jurisdiction to this Court to review capital cases and we see that that statute was passed in 1889.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.605" offset="9338358">That statute provided that a case might be remanded under the direction from this Court but in looking at the statute and interpreting a jurisdictional statute, we have to look to the state of the law at the time we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.765" offset="9419024">And we may differ but we think that, that reference to the cases in our opinion will show that the state of the law at the time certainly the State Court law, followed the limited waiver and would not require the gamble, the desperate chance which the Court of Appeals said here was in inherent in the exercise of the statutory right to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.895" offset="9579520">And we think that after that statute of 1889 there was no further authority given to this Court, indeed absent any congressional intent, we look to the uniform code of military justice, we find out that Green if he has been in the military service couldn't have been retried for first degree, couldn't have been sentenced to death, and we see that, that was passed in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.219" offset="9692787">It certainly is other than a congressional approval of a jurisdictional power to remand for retrial on an offence greater than that embodied in the conviction appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.483" offset="9765930">Very quickly we want to review our alternative argument that if a new trial was proper, this one wasn't fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.967" offset="9803860">We note in our brief on page 31 the assertions which were testified to by government witnesses, which we felt very damaging, the rights of the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.977" offset="9879824">The government contends that there were some of these that were not confirmed that denied by the prisoner at his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.083" offset="9912320">We cite, in addition we cite particularly the fact that the defendant told Sergeant Future that he had written a letter advertising suicide just before they smelt smoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.332" offset="9973238">We note that the defendant said he mailed that letter at 12:30 at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.842" offset="9995285">We note that Judge Bazelon dissenting in the Court below pointed out that if the jury believed that the defendant has said what Sergeant Future said he said, it's whole story became incredible and ridiculous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.336" offset="10057247">We note these remarks about blowing up the house, on May 28th before (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.984" offset="10091833">We note in our introduction to this McNabb section of our brief, the fact that officers and the fire inspector testified that he had left the top floor had gone directly to the basement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.539" offset="10154109">We note that the defendant testified and had to testify that he stopped on the first floor, made a telephone call, it was unsuccessful, he notified people (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.876" offset="10199458">We have throughout this record as shown by the assertion from page 31 of our brief, tremendous prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.282" offset="10229029">The conclusion is innocent, but that the government knew what the defendant was going to say and had to say at his second trial, set the testimony of the officers and the inspectors out to make Green look like a liar before it ever (Inaudible), maybe that's what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.600" offset="10322338">Now this Court, at that time, of course the Timeless case was tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.960" offset="10347833">You have a 5(a) McNabb Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.132" offset="10380434">It's been suggested and it's suggested very clearly in this Court's decision in Mallory that there is such a thing as 5(b) McNabb Rule we call it that because we recognize the purpose after all of a 5(a) McNabb Rule is to get a man judicial caution or some sort of caution before he puts his head in the noose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.674" offset="10494642">Here he put his head in the noose before he was committed two-and-a-half days after he was under surveillance, under custody of the police department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.321" offset="10553260">This result, I believe was contemplated by this -- this problem I believe was in the Court's mind, has been in this Court's mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.865" offset="10615432">The purpose of Rule 5 is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.857" offset="10627344">There must be probable cause determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.623" offset="10638420">The defendant must be advised of his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.728" offset="10650854">The government admits that there was opportunity for the extortion of confession here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.935" offset="10687739">They say the police didn't create it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.420" offset="10697665">We say that's irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.581" offset="10710309">At least they can do as Judge Bazelon below suggested as the British invariably do is once they put him into custody, advised him of his right to silence, of his right to counsel, of the fact that the statements he made would be used against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.103" offset="10800379">Finally we have remarks which we urge as prejudicially unfair to the defendant at the conclusion of his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.366" offset="10837368">The government urges these remarks were provoked by -- are mentioned on -- are limited in part pages from a transcript of 35 of the final items, that these remarks of the government were provoked, by our mention of the electric chair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.131" offset="10912496">I don't -- I'm not experienced in criminal law, but it appears to us that any counsel for a man under a capital charge would be delinquent in his duty to the client if he did not mention the consequence of a verdict and that certainly when the Court instructed the jury that the penalty for the crime is death, and impressed on jurors on voir dire as shown by the supplemental briefs to a member of the jury, that the consequence of their verdict would be death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.716" offset="11078844">Your Honor we would like to save a few minutes for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2777.183" offset="11108728">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.528" offset="11130044">No federal court has ever accepted the limited waiver doctrine which petitioner now urges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.309" offset="11165153">On the contrary that doctrine has been specifically rejected by the federal courts as early as 1846 in United States against Harding, a decision by Mr. Justice Grier then sitting in the Circuit Court and which he indicated that upon retrial after conviction for the lesser included offence, a defendant could be retried for the greater offence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.012" offset="11292003">With respect to the early history of the Fifth Amendment, I have cited in the government's supplemental briefs, when first proposed the Fifth Amendment read, “no person shall be subject to more than one punishment or one trial for the same offence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.863" offset="11391373">Objection was made to that in the debates in Congress on the grounds that, that would preclude a defendant from securing a reversal of his conviction and a retrial, and of course we know that subsequently when the Fifth Amendment was enacted that provision was omitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.575" offset="11486250">The early history of the double jeopardy provisions in the United States are summarized in an article in Eleven (Inaudible) Law Review by Judge Bigelow, the reference is contained in the government's supplemental brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.459" offset="11553750">It is of course clear that a defendant may after a second trial receive a sentence greater than that initially imposed at his first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.683" offset="11598681">Thus every defendant who receives less than the maximum sentence at his first trial runs the risk of ultimately receiving a greater sentenced if he succeeds in having his first conviction reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.982" offset="11659912">I check that because I believe in essence that is all that is involved in this aspect of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.058" offset="11692199">The government submits that this case is controlled by Trono, but it is for many reasons an a fortiori case, after Trono and I suggest now that the case is very analogous to Stroud against United States in 251 US.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.662" offset="11774642">There the defendant was tried three times for murder in the first degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.300" offset="11797107">The first time he was found guilty and the death sentence was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.883" offset="11819468">This conviction was reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.785" offset="11827096">Upon his second trial the jury finding him guilty recommended that capital punishment be dispensed with, which was permissible under that statute, and the defendant received a sentence of life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.864" offset="11887386">This conviction was reversed and upon the third trial he was found guilty of murder in the first degree, the jury making no recommendation dispensing the capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.732" offset="11934824">He was there upon sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.658" offset="11946632">This Court found that there was no violation of Fifth Amendment in the subsequent imposition of the death sentence and wrote that the only thing that the appellate court could do when he secured the reversal was to remand the case for a new trial and that in such cases the defendant was not placed in second jeopardy, within the meaning of the Constitution, the Court citing Trono.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.426" offset="12061675">I would like to state if I may the reasons why the government feels that this case follows a fortiori from the Trono decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.010" offset="12095948">First the basis for the reversal of the conviction of second degree murder was petitioners' assertion that if he were guilty of any crime it was murder in the first degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.431" offset="12149656">Because this was petitioners theory accepted by the Court of Appeals it was apparent that the only crime for which he could be retried was the crime of first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.683" offset="12202632">Under these, under these facts in the theory of the reversal there could be trial for no other crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.252" offset="12228963">Indeed the Court of Appeals specifically remanded the case for retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.717" offset="12250802">And while petitioner had on the first appeal asked the Court of Appeals for a reversal of his conviction, he had not asked for a dismissal of the indictment or a judgment of acquittal or any other relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.596" offset="12310361">The remand to the District Court for retrial offers to be made what was the natural consequence of the theory which petitioner had urged upon the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.040" offset="12360098">First it was impossible to retry the defendant for any crime other than first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.024" offset="12387997">If as Trono holds even where it is possible to retry a defendant for a lesser included offense, it is permissible to retry him for the greater offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.959" offset="12435749">Surely here when retrial could only be for first degree murder such retrial is possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.187" offset="12472738">Were this is not so, the consequence of the error committed by the trial judge at the first trial would be to confer upon the defendant an absolute immunity from retrial for the crime of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.445" offset="12549747">This Court wrote in the (Inaudible) case that the Constitution does not require that sentencing should be again and which a wrong move by the judge means immunity for the prisoner and that case and that language of the court we think applies here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3154.036" offset="12616098">Well that maybe a good argument that's undesirable but that is not logic outcome, the denial of that isn't a logical compulsion, that if he has been tried, that if he has been tried and the jury brings in the verdict and that verdict has a fatal error and therefore calls for reversal or nullification of that verdict to a sentence under it, but that's an end of the matter, that means it maybe an undesirable result but it isn't necessarily in conflict with reason, because that's the state of today's English law as you well know.</text>

            <text syncTime="4177.417" offset="16709590">Are you on behalf of a government claim that in fact in human experience, in the experience of everybody who has tried cases, when a jury brings in, in turn a verdict saying we acquit this man of battery with malice or any other serious offense, grand larceny, we acquit him of grand larceny, you send him to jail for ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4211.890" offset="16847517">Well a jury comes in and uses those explicit words of determination of finding of acquittal.</text>

            <text syncTime="4290.048" offset="17160150">I suggest before you answer on the facts, the experience, the workings of the mind of the jury, the consequences, of what that means in fact, not legal consequences, I'm not taking about that at the moment, before you answer that affirmatively you got to consult (Inaudible) whether they think when the jury says nothing it means the opposite to this, they say something.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sand</label>
            <text syncTime="4313.323" offset="17253251">Now from the verdict of this jury, what in fact they found, they found that the defendant was guilty of arson, they found that the victim died as a result of the actions by the defendant, and so in essence we know that in fact that first jury found that the defendant was guilty of all the elements of felony murder and so in those sense, in fact all legal consequences did that first jury acquit the defendant of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="4351.337" offset="17405283">The government provides not only on the Trono case which is -- and it is not the only holding by the Court on this point, but also on Brantley against the State of Georgia in 217 US, which came under writ of error from the state court, there the defendant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and obtained a reversal of that conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4374.246" offset="17496921">On retrial he claimed that he could not be tried for the greater of offence, for murder, either under the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4383.041" offset="17532134">The question not having then been resolved by this Court, whether the Fifth Amendment and its prohibition against double jeopardy applied to the states whether directly or whether it was an aspect of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4403.775" offset="17615099">The Supreme Court in a unanimous per curiam decision stated that the contention that retrial for the greater offense was a violation of double jeopardy, it is absolutely without matter, it was not a case of questioning jeopardy under any view of the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4428.378" offset="17713424">The reasoning supports the Trono decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4434.706" offset="17738815">As I've said, the consequence of a contrary view is that the error which is committed at the first trial, is not eradicated by a reversal of a conviction that is perpetuated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4448.760" offset="17795030">Moreover, what occurs is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4451.094" offset="17804330">There is no valid finding that the act ever occurred, that the defendant ever caused the death of the victim, but there is a finding that if he did cause the death of the victim, it was not by premeditation or under such other circumstances as with need to the greater offense, the aggravated offense, if the contrary rule binds the hands of the second jury regardless of the evidence presented at the second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4484.933" offset="17939644">I would now like to direct myself to the prior un-appealed conviction for arson and say briefly that arson is in no sense a lesser included offense of a crime of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="4498.868" offset="17995442">The jury could not have returned a verdict of guilty of arson on the murder count of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4508.011" offset="18032013">Arson of course is a crime against property that the gist of the felony murder -- of the murder count is a homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="4518.631" offset="18074436">Such cases as States against Cooper which hold that out of one transaction there can be only be one crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.178" offset="18108709">That of course has been rejected by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4532.799" offset="18131174">Nor does res judicata as applied to the prior un-appealed conviction, a petitioner, for that judgment -- where the only judgment reflected in the arson conviction is a finding by the jury that the defendant did set the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="4550.239" offset="18200869">This is unlike those cases where there is a prior acquittal with respect to a base of underlying facts such as the (Inaudible) where it has been said that the government is precluded from seeking to reestablish a fact which a prior jury has found could not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="4572.799" offset="18291148">With respect to the argument that the Court of Appeals lacked the jurisdiction to remand for a retrial under Section 2106, the Court of Appeals is specifically empowered to remand a case for such further proceedings as maybe just under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4594.311" offset="18377143">Since the only theory of the reversal was that this crime could be first degree murder and no other crime, obviously the only course open to the Court of Appeals was to remand for retrial for the greater offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4611.068" offset="18444225">Collateral estoppel of course was not applied to a prior reversed verdict in the same proceeding and moreover there is no basic evidentiary fact found by the jury in the first case, at the first trial which in anyway exculpates the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4634.998" offset="18539938">I would like turn now to alleged errors at the trial itself, and with respect to petitioner's contention that prejudicial error resulted from the admission into evidence of a prearranged basis, and in this respect I think it maybe helpful to briefly sketch in chronological sequence, the events which led to the taking of those statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4662.220" offset="18648816">On the morning of May 26, 1953, at 7:40 that morning, firemen arrived at the scene and broke into this house on Massachusetts Avenue, the doors and windows of which were locked.</text>
            <text syncTime="4675.253" offset="18700957">They found on entering that the victim had perished, and that the petitioner was suffering from superficial stab wounds and from exposure to smoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="4684.814" offset="18739200">He was immediately taken to emergency hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="4688.976" offset="18755814">At about 8:45 that same morning, Sergeant Kocher after he introduced himself as a member of the homicide squad, questioned petitioner for about 15 minutes in examining room of the emergency hospital while doctors and nurses were coming and going.</text>
            <text syncTime="4707.005" offset="18828016">Petitioner at this time was neither under arrest nor in police custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="4712.773" offset="18851004">In fact Sergeant Kocher did not even know at that time that the fire was the result of arson, and he did not even know in other words that there was any crime that had been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4725.137" offset="18900532">He only knew as he testified that someone had perished in the file.</text>
            <text syncTime="4730.661" offset="18922580">At the time of the questioning petitioner's answers were clear and coherent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.963" offset="18939820">He stated that he awoke at 7:40 that morning, that he smelled smoke, that he was attacked, that he went down the basement, that he was attacked and there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4746.036" offset="18984124">This was the same basic story that petitioner told in later interviews and at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4753.998" offset="19015889">Between the time of the arrival on the scene and 10 o'clock of the fire and 10 o'clock that morning, back at the scene it was ascertained that the fire was the result of arson, in that there were five separate and independent fires which were started by the use of turpentine, and that the gas lights had been opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="4777.923" offset="19111602">Thereupon Sergeant Kocher returned to the hospital, it's now 10 o'clock on the morning of the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="4785.771" offset="19143053">Petitioner is still in the examining room and he is asked these five separate fires and the gas blast and he says that they must have been started by this man who attacked him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4798.633" offset="19194462">But stationary was also found on the scene and petitioner was asked whether he had been writing any letters and he denied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4806.676" offset="19226645">At about 2:10 the same day petitioner was taken to the District of Columbia Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="4813.915" offset="19255589">He was at this time placed in a locked ward with a dozen other patients and a police guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4819.784" offset="19279099">This is the earliest time that it can be said that petitioner was in police custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.537" offset="19306057">In this respect the opinion of Judge Bazelon dissenting below is significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4834.744" offset="19338971">Because Judge Bazelon states that on Tuesday afternoon to Thursday, he petitioner was under arrest and the statements here in question are those obtained from him during that period in interrogations by two policemen and two fire inspectors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4857.242" offset="19428937">But from Tuesday afternoon Judge Bazelon says, and it would appear from this that he does not address himself to the question of the admissibility of the testimony with respect to the questioning on Tuesday morning at a time when petitioner was really not under any form of police detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4881.324" offset="19525277">Since the story which petitioner told on Tuesday morning was in all substantial assessment, the identical story as he told on later occasions it is clear that that no right (Inaudible) was prejudiced by the admission of this evidence into testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4902.088" offset="19608346">Under the Mitchell case a confession made immediately after arrest is not invalidated ab initio by virtue of a subsequent unlawful detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4912.241" offset="19648888">Therefore even if it was assumed arguendo that there was such a subsequent unlawful detention, petitioner has not contested it by the testimony adduced by the government at this stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4929.903" offset="19719523">The questioning on the afternoon at the time when petitioner was in the locked ward, (Inaudible) previously as told to the investigating officer and there was no questioning on the 27th, the Wednesday without following the file.</text>
            <text syncTime="4950.962" offset="19803847">The petitioner was again questioned on Thursday the 28th.</text>
            <text syncTime="4958.461" offset="19833835">At the trial there was held voir dire to determine the admissibility of these prearrangement statements and at that voir dire defense counsel (Inaudible) evidence which the government could have easily put to trial because this is after all a second trial, a retrial specifically waived any objection to the introduction of testimony with respect to the questioning on the 28th.</text>
            <text syncTime="4989.221" offset="19956820">This case is entirely unlike the Mallory case where there was a situation created by the investigating officer designedly or otherwise during which there was the opportunity to extract the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="5007.411" offset="20029544">This is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5009.566" offset="20038217">Even as the dissenting judge concedes the delay in arraigning the petitioner was an unavoidable delay and not created by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5028.503" offset="20113972">I would like then to direct myself to the question of the remarks made by the government attorney in summation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5036.852" offset="20147304">And the claim of these remarks prejudiced petitioner because they minimize the responsibility of the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="5045.699" offset="20182727">We content that the remarks of the government's attorney in the context of this trial did not constitute prejudicial error.</text>
            <text syncTime="5055.074" offset="20220238">We know at the outset that no objection was made to these remarks prior to the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="5061.410" offset="20245629">There was or hasn't been claimed that the trial judge's instructions to the jury were in any way improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="5069.948" offset="20279693">Although the defense counsel was specifically given an opportunity to submit any kind of instructions to the jury subsequently to these remarks, he did not avail himself of that opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5090.675" offset="20362658">Under the felony murder statute imposition of the death sentence by the trial judge is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="5098.490" offset="20393900">This fact emphasizes that the role of the jury in this case is simply a fact finding function.</text>
            <text syncTime="5108.200" offset="20432771">There was -- it was not open to the jury in this case to make any recommendation with respect to sentencing and so there was no occasion for the jury to get into that area of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5122.083" offset="20488255">Its functions were simply a fact finding functions and although the imposition of the death sentence by the trial judge was mandatory, it was not of course inevitable that that sentence to be ultimately be carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="5138.221" offset="20552829">Defense counsel, however, sought to create the impression that the function of the jury was not merely to find the facts, but also to impose sentence or as you put it to send the defendant to the electric chair and the death sentence was not only mandatory, but that its exposition was inevitable.</text>
