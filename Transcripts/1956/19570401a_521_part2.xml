            <label>Mr. Edward L. Barrett, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="140.502" offset="666394">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.222" offset="677261">I should like to address myself first to the McNabb question and reserving the other two questions for later consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.102" offset="716758">It's noteworthy that in this case; petitioner makes no claim that his confession was a result of coercion, physical or psychological.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.575" offset="754688">The petitioner himself testified in this case that he had been treated kindly and made no complaint with respect to actual coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.815" offset="799619">The petitioner's claim on the McNabb point is essentially that Rule 5 (a) must be interpreted as forbidding any delay in taking a person before the committing magistrate, other than that physically necessary for locating a magistrate and transporting the prisoner there.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.620" offset="866910">We then argued that under the McNabb rule, any confession obtained during a period of delay and beyond that must be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.540" offset="898570">Now, the Government concedes, of course, that the police could have found a committing magistrate and brought the petitioner before him within a relatively short time after his arrest at 2:30 on a Thursday afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.751" offset="947367">It is the Government's petition -- position, the Rule 5 (a) must be given a broader interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.481" offset="974326">That delay may be necessary within the meaning of the Rule beyond the time physically necessary to take an arrested person before a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.821" offset="1011628">That the delay in this case was necessary on a reasonable interpretation of the Rule and that hence from McNabb rule does not apply to exclude this confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.923" offset="1052066">The facts in this case, we think, are an excellent example of the reason why a mechanical interpretation of Rule 5 (a) as applying only to the time actually necessary to find a magistrate to take a man before him, would be an undesirable interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.057" offset="1128657">Consider what you have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.346" offset="1137748">A rape was committed in the basement of an apartment house.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.700" offset="1155197">The facts are that this basement may be reached by a set of wooden stairs or through a door, into a janitor's apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.253" offset="1189366">The courts investing the right of the victim, tells the police that after she came down to this basement to do her washing, she heard nobody come down these set of wooden stairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.095" offset="1240775">That's conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.865" offset="1247880">And the petitioner himself conceded that he had been in the room shortly before the rape and to help the victim with a hose.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.459" offset="1290198">The inference at this point was that -- probability was that the person who committed the crime came from the janitor's apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.641" offset="1323008">The description given by the victim would have fitted generally, apparently, the petitioner and his two nephews.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.853" offset="1359788">A tall, Negro with bright eyes, with a white hat, was about as much as the victim was able to say at this stage of the game.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.703" offset="1403256">So, hereafter, preliminary investigation, the police were faced with the fact that on the physical evidence there was a reasonable suspicion at least that one of these three people committed the rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.098" offset="1452784">Further investigation apparently disclosed that the petitioner and one of his nephews had disappeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.469" offset="1482250">The next morning, at some point, it's not clear from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.919" offset="1496043">The police picked up the two nephews, brought them into the police station and questioned them.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.577" offset="1518717">That record doesn't disclose how long or under what circumstances with respect to the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.268" offset="1545467">They finally found the petitioner at 2:30 in the afternoon.</text>

            <text syncTime="369.105" offset="1580784">The nephews were at the police station when the petitioner was brought in.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.475" offset="1598339">They brought the petitioner in and they questioned him.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.225" offset="1613281">Now, several officers were apparently present during the questioning though the record doesn't tell us much about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.762" offset="1643478">And, it's well to remember that this case was tried well over a year after the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.457" offset="1662182">So that everybody's memories with respect to the details were undoubtedly fuzzy.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.347" offset="1689767">He was questioned -- it's probable, though the record is not entirely clear that he was questioned in the presence of his two nephews.</text>

            <text syncTime="415.269" offset="1765522">The petitioner testified that his nephews and his brother were questioned -- were present when he was questioned at this initial period.</text>

            <text syncTime="506.605" offset="2130819">He was then taken to the Sex Squad office where in the presence, he testified of his brother and his two nephews, the police asked them if the three of them would consent to take a lie detector test to determine apparently who was telling the truth.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.831" offset="2255684">Now, all of the delay after this time was consumed in waiting for the officer to arrive, who gave lie detector test and in giving the test first to the two nephews and finally to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.751" offset="2323393">The brothers alone -- fuzziness on this issue, the -- the record seems to bear out statement that from about 4 o'clock in the afternoon until 8 o'clock when the petitioner was taken in for the lie detector test, he sat on a chair in the Sex Squad office with one or both of his nephews.</text>

            <text syncTime="1621.363" offset="6589816">And they have to make some inquiry before they take the step of filing a formal charge against one of these individuals with the crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="1689.599" offset="6862744">This case is -- is a good example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.309" offset="6873610">It could not be said that the petitioner here was held incommunicado.</text>

            <text syncTime="2122.939" offset="8596125">Many authorities have contended over the years that there should be some regularized procedure for questioning suspects.</text>

            <text syncTime="2136.058" offset="8648579">Other suggestions, the Uniform Arrest Act, for example, suggested that the police should -- that the police should be able to take the man before the Commissioner and the Commissioner should have discretion to release him to the custody of the police for up to 48 hours for reasonable investigation before the police would have the necessity to file a -- a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.117" offset="8728827">We haven't had either to rule making or to the legislature a careful spelling out of what ought to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.259" offset="8769473">Now -- now we suggest that the -- that the position of society is not just the police who're suspecting here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.829" offset="8803746">Obviously the interests in society are that we ought to apprehend people who commit rape, other serious crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.749" offset="8831436">Obviously the privacy of the victim here was very severely debated and perhaps there was a risk of the privacy of other women, would -- would be invaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.656" offset="8875008">And that we have to balance in all of these cases the public interest in reducing private, illegal invasion to privacy among the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.246" offset="8917431">Now, I recognize that public officers are obviously held to a higher standard, but we suggest that what was done here doesn't offend the moral sense and that it was certainly not clear to -- to the police here, for example, that what they were doing was a violation of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.917" offset="8984095">As we point in our brief, almost without exception, the Courts of Appeals since McNabb and Upshaw have recognized in the cases the necessity for some detention other than that absolutely necessary to take the man before a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.297" offset="9057552">And there's a whole string of cases in this circuit and other circuits where the police have -- where the courts have not applied the McNabb rule in that literal mechanical sense that -- that the only thing is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.388" offset="9113976">Such an application has certain curious circumstances, too, unrelated to the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.698" offset="9139158">If you couldn't find a magistrate the 24 hours, presumably then the police could question a man for 24 hours as long they didn't interfere with the voluntary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.108" offset="9180850">But in another case where you could find one in five minutes, you couldn't question him at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3034.420" offset="12242087">Here it was more like the Mitchell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.920" offset="12252118">This Court decided where it was only after the defendant had confessed to the crime so that he had made his confession to the crime that he then having confessed the crime said, "Now, I let you search."</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.807" offset="12311573">And he signed a written consent So, it was explicit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3057.744" offset="12335397">So, we -- we say that the -- the search stands or falls really on the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.924" offset="12356086">That -- that had once having voluntarily made a confession of the crime, this was essentially what happened in the Mitchell case, he confessed and then he said, "You can go and -- and get this evidence."</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.140" offset="12408957">Now, on the question of the jury, position of the Government here that the judge did probably the only thing he could have done -- once the jury had asked a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.160" offset="12477085">Now, we say you can't say, petitioner said that the jury was not concerned with this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.000" offset="12500386">Congress in its wisdom had seen fit to -- to create the situation where the penalty for the crime is either an indeterminate sentence for 10 to 30 years or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.624" offset="12546884">The jury decides whether or not it shall be death.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.274" offset="12561512">The judge then decides if they don't say death, what -- what it shall be up to a maximum of 10 to 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.962" offset="12592232">Well, of course, the jury is sentencing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.722" offset="12603308">The jury is deciding, "Shall this man die?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.253" offset="12621385">But it seems to us that the jury could not rationally decide that issue without knowing the alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.933" offset="12652105">And once the jury asked the question that they did here, it's clear that they were speculating on the alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.853" offset="12675824">What's going to happen to this man if we don't give him the death penalty?</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.413" offset="12694006">And can be it said that it's more of a prejudice to defendant to have speculation without fact or -- or to give them the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.518" offset="12746459">Now, as we find out in the footnote in our brief on page 39, Crow against United States which this Court, it was up on certiorari on another point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.444" offset="12782195">This Court provided certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.384" offset="12789927">You have the situation come up and -- and the judge points us the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.104" offset="12804765">He refused to ask -- answer the jury's questions about probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.544" offset="12814587">The jury wouldn't have him against the for death penalty anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.484" offset="12834335">Now, this is not the kind of a case where we can see that you do work the kind of a case where the instruction is apt to (Inaudible) the issue of reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.634" offset="12878952">That is where the jury is interested in -- is in seeing well if we find him guilty, he maybe able to get off in five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.282" offset="12913539">And well we're not really sure whether he did but it's only five years, so we'll find him guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.886" offset="12931929">This -- this one is that kind of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.586" offset="12942691">The petitioner under the circumstances of this case what the jury said was clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.476" offset="12962335">They have no question about guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.944" offset="12972157">This wasn't a question about being reasonable doubt as to guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.604" offset="12982815">Their ultimate finding I suppose was that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.534" offset="12994518">That what they were concerned with is, "Do we give him the death penalty?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.754" offset="13011446">And on the Winston case, the Court said they could consider the broad spectrum and -- and the Government's position is that -- that most certainly that they've asked the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.964" offset="13056272">That they have raised the issue that they have come into the Court and said, "Will he be held for his natural life only?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.753" offset="13091380">The judge did here, the only reasonable thing to do.We suggested that if he's -- if he had refused to do this and the death penalty had been convicted, the counsel for the petitioner could with as much reason perhaps have argued that that was prejudicial to the defendant under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.428" offset="13170061">Arguing then that well, maybe they thought he would only get two years or five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.838" offset="13187720">So, you wouldn't know what they thought his -- his ultimate period of incarceration would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.238" offset="13213320">So, our contention essentially then is that -- that once they made the issue was certainly irrelevant that the issue they would decide, should the man die?</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.725" offset="13251250">And this can't be decided solely in terms of the -- of the crime and the nature and the circumstances as the jury is bound to want to know if there's evidence here, what's the alternative?</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.525" offset="13294508">Now, it may be that the unfortunate thing here is that Congress fixed these alternatives so far apart and that -- and that the -- perhaps that is the -- maybe if the alternatives had been life and death, the Court would have found that the jury would not have found death.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.847" offset="13367756">But that's that fault of -- of the statute, not with what the judge did here.</text>
