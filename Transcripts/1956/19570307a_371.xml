            <label>Mr. Robert Ash</label>
            <text syncTime="8.112" offset="135816">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.060" offset="139577">In this case, we have a quite a change of pace from the preceding case.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.242" offset="156296">We have a simple one-issue case with the facts undisputed and there is no question of constitutionality involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.201" offset="192136">Our question is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.676" offset="202062">Does the Tax Court have the discretionary power inherent in trial courts to vacate its decisions out of time in order to accomplish justice or does the statute, which says that a Tax Court decision becomes final if appeal is not taken within three months deprive it of such power?</text>
            <text syncTime="46.760" offset="290461">This is a case of first impression and this Court has never before passed upon the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.137" offset="311881">The facts are very interesting and unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.589" offset="325778">Lasky owned a contractual right to participate in the profits from the motion picture, the story of “Sergeant York”.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.334" offset="360678">In addition, he was employed by Warner Brothers to -- as a producer of motion pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.594" offset="381785">He got into a dispute with Warner Brothers as to the amounts that were due under his participation contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.719" offset="410206">In order to avoid litigation, which would have jeopardized his employment, he sold his rights under the participation contract to United Artists for $805,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.984" offset="467257">The gain on this sale was reported as a long-term capital gain in the separate returns filed by Lasky and his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.788" offset="502575">Upon audit, the petitioners -- upon audit, the petitioners' tax returns from 1943, the Commissioner determined that the -- each taxpayer owed deficiencies in tax in excess of $224,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.039" offset="567568">Lasky employed an outstanding law firm in Los Angeles to contest the deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.256" offset="592436">Appeal was taken to the Tax Court and the Court was -- and the case was tried in December of 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.740" offset="626291">However, the law firm, which Lasky employed, did not actually try the case but associated another law firm which did try the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.336" offset="668714">The case obviously was a close and difficult one because the Tax Court judge took approximately two years and four months to promulgate the findings of fact and opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.802" offset="730572">Now, they were promulgated on April the 8th, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.460" offset="757217">On the same date, the Tax Court entered its decisions based on the findings of fact and opinion and mailed copies to the first counsel of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.746" offset="798386">The decisions in some way were filed in the correspondence file of the case and not in the legal or pleading file and did not come to the attention of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.785" offset="838510">Now, it's important to know that under the practice of the Tax Court, they first issue findings of facts and opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.449" offset="881142">Thereafter, they enter a decision in accordance with the findings of fact and opinion, which fixes the tax liability in dollars and that this is a separate and distinct document.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.888" offset="930879">An appeal was -- is taken from this decision in dollars and then the limitations runs from the date of the decision, and I say that it was the file -- that these decisions got into the file without counsel knowing about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.749" offset="986363">Upon receipt of the findings of fact and the opinion by Lasky's counsel, the conference was held in the office of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.778" offset="1022516">Questions of appeal and other items were discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.239" offset="1036309">Lasky was advised that he had three months from the date of the decisions within which to appeal and that the decisions had not been received.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.879" offset="1074866">The matter of course was a great concern to Lasky.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.751" offset="1086360">So, from time to time, he inquired counsel about the status of his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.611" offset="1105795">He was informed each time that the decisions had not been received, that he had nothing to worry about and that as soon as the decisions were received, there be a further conference to decide what actions should be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.175" offset="1156054">On the early part of August 1954, which was more than three months from the -- from -- from April 8, Congress for Lasky telephoned -- counsel for Lasky telephoned him and told him that going through the file on the case, he discovered the decisions that were dated April the 8th, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.512" offset="1225435">That they were on letter size paper then placed in the Lasky file on the correspondence side instead of on the legal or pleading side that he had overlooked them, and he expressed regret at the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.795" offset="1286562">It was then that I got into the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.460" offset="1297220">I felt that immediate action was necessary and know I knew little of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.270" offset="1316446">Immediately, on August 24, 1954, I filed a motion for leave to file a motion to vacate the decision out of time, and the motion to vacate the decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.152" offset="1355943">In my motion, I stated that I filed a statement of facts for the later date.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.244" offset="1372348">After I learned the facts, I filed a statement of the facts on October 18, 1954 and amended my motion asking for rehearing of the case on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.902" offset="1414980">Well, this -- the Government's brief says that our motion for rehearing was an afterthought because that made until several months after the original findings of fact decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.550" offset="1453537">Now, the truth is that as soon as I am running the facts, it was evident to me that Lasky had a meritorious case and the justice demanded a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.913" offset="1491048">On December the 13th, 1954, Judge Harron of the Tax Court granted our motion and set the case for further hearing in January of 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.354" offset="1532740">The case was reheard in January.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.817" offset="1542666">Four witnesses were heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.723" offset="1550294">Three of these witnesses have not been witnesses in the original trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.431" offset="1565132">Two were officers of the United Artists Corporation, which had made the purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.313" offset="1580596">One was an accountant who specializes in motion picture affairs and Mr. Lasky was recalled.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.044" offset="1603584">We felt that we've made out a case on rehearing before Judge Harron.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.892" offset="1622915">However, she -- although she made additional findings, she reached the same conclusion that she had reached at the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.654" offset="1658023">We appealed to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.656" offset="1670040">That Court dismissed the appeal on the ground that the Tax Court was not a court at all but was merely an administrative agency which had assumed the powers of a District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.759" offset="1718418">We take the position that although a Tax Court for purposes of housing keeping is designated as an independent agency in the executive branch of the Government, it is in fact a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.850" offset="1766797">The Government in its brief, at page 16, admits that this is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.608" offset="1785814">As a Court, we say that it has the inherent power of any trial court within its discretion to vacate decisions out of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.310" offset="1820609">Now, the -- we have authority for this position in the Reo Motor case which is on all fours practically with our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.263" offset="1852374">That case went all the way to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.008" offset="1863450">After the decision became final, the taxpayer asked leave of the Tax Court to file a motion to vacate the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.912" offset="1891035">The reason was, the stipulation -- stipulation of facts upon which the Tax Court originally decided the case contained a mistake of fact which resulted in an omission from invested capital of over $2 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.743" offset="1942340">The Tax Court denied the motion but the Sixth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.889" offset="1966895">The reasoning of the Sixth Circuit is set forth at page 17 of our original brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.296" offset="1988524">Another supporting case is a Fifth Circuit decision, the Buttgenbach case which was decided way back in 1933.</text>

            <text syncTime="1832.124" offset="7431920">Now, we think that Section 1140 in the context of the -- of all the provisions of the Code dealing with procedures, administration, collection of taxes that that provision provides a cutoff day, as the Tax Court decisions beyond which the power of -- of the Court, the Tax Court or of the court of review expires.</text>

            <text syncTime="1895.911" offset="7686980">Now, that statute was considered by this Court in two cases, the Northern Coal Company case in 1934 and the Simpson case in 1944 in 321 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.969" offset="7763257">And the Court's decisions in those cases except the construction that we placed upon the statute of the Ninth Circuit in this case placed upon the statute, namely, that when one of the events specified by the statute has occurred to make a decision final, it no longer becomes -- no longer is subject to the process of correction or reexamination that might otherwise exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.176" offset="7908080">In the Northern Coal Company case, the Court -- this Court had affirmed a Circuit Court of Appeals decision sustaining a Board of Tax Appeal decision against the Commissioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1976.393" offset="8008913">It was denied a mandate issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2091.268" offset="8468459">The order denying certiorari was vacated and certiorari was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.784" offset="8494477">However, the Court in its order granting rehearing of certiorari requested counsel to -- to discuss the question of its jurisdiction to grant rehearing in view of Section 1140 of the statute and in view of the case of Helvering against Northern Coal Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.597" offset="8561768">In that, the case was argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.935" offset="8567097">The Court entered a decision, opinion by Mr. Justice Jackson holding that since the denial of certiorari had become final by reason of the expiration of a 25-day period to file a petition for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.072" offset="8631672">Even though it was in the same term of court and even though this Court has on occasion granted untimely petitions for rehearing where because of subsequent development of a conflict subsequently or some other reason indicating the need for further review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.239" offset="8700322">Notwithstanding that, in cases originating in the Tax Court, once there was a denial of certiorari, the decision was final.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.610" offset="8733863">And -- and it was held in the Simpson case that this Court had no jurisdiction to grant rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.507" offset="8761448">Now, the Court -- that -- those two cases clearly drew a distinction between cases coming here from the Tax Court and cases coming here from other courts and that the reason for the distinction is the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.614" offset="8833860">Congress by putting these finality provisions in the Internal Revenue Code with respect to the Tax Court decisions has treated those cases differently from other cases and that -- and that -- that provision for finality has to be respected, whether you call it Tax Court, a court or an agency.It isn't quite immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.296" offset="8940544">Now, there's an argument that there is -- there are inherent powers of -- of court to set aside decisions where good cause exists and that inherent power still resides in the Tax Court notwithstanding the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.602" offset="9041795">We don't see how that argument can be made in the face of the decision to the Simpson and the Northern Coal Company case -- cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.178" offset="9076067">But in all events, even if -- even if there were no statute, even if this -- this case had come from a District Court, certainly, there is no absolute discretion that exists in the District Court to set aside a judgment which has become final by reason of the expiration time for review for any reason whatsoever at any time that there isn't such a completely open-ended judgment even in a District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.287" offset="9208560">Now, this -- the -- the so-called inherent power of the Court is accompanied by a limitation, which has been established for many years, which was reaffirmed in the very case upon which Mr. Ash relies, the Wayne Gas Company case in 300 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.117" offset="9279822">Because in that case, the Court held and it was merely restating what had previously have been held many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.994" offset="9319320">That rehearing could not be granted for the purpose of extending the time for appeal, so that if there was something in the way of fraud or -- or some fundamental character of error initiating the judgment itself, that was one situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.364" offset="9396851">But where the only reason for granting the rehearing was to enter a fresh judgment to start the time for appeal, running all over again after it had expired that it -- that in any case where that was done, the appeal has to be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.072" offset="9455679">And the Ninth Circuit in this case, we think directly found that that's exactly what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.680" offset="9482115">Through this unfortunate error, the -- the time for appeal had run.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.485" offset="9521298">The judgment of the Tax Court have become final and the Tax Court, that of feelings of sympathy perhaps entered a fresh judgment which had the effect of -- always -- always hope would have the effect of starting the time for appeal running all over again.</text>

            <text syncTime="2426.985" offset="9811362">That was the only new factor in this situation and we -- we think that the decision in the Wayne Company case shows that the -- that the District Court had -- had undertaken to grant rehearing for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.969" offset="9879280">It would not start the period for -- to appeal running all over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.007" offset="9899447">But in any event, our basic proposition is that here, we have a statute which makes it unnecessary for the Court to consider any questions of -- of the inherent power to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.872" offset="9962872">Congress has -- has dealt with the -- with this question of finality and my new meticulous detail, if Your Honors will examine Section 1140, you will find that it covers every conceivable contingency that it can develop in the litigation of a Tax Court case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.200" offset="10044165">If a petition for review isn't filed, that the petition for review is filed, if the Court of Appeals reverses or it modifies or affirms, if certiorari is denied, every possible disposition of the case on appeal is dealt with and every -- as well as the disposition of the case, there's no appeal was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.890" offset="10138937">Now, the reason why Congress did that was set out in the Senate Committee Report which the Court relied on and the Simpson case in which we quote on page 24 of -- of our brief that reported by -- you may read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.079" offset="10199646">It's quite short, refers to Section 1005 of the Revenue Act of 1926 which is Section 1140 decision I'll quote, it says, "In as much as the statute of limitations upon assessments and suits for collection, both of which are suspended during review of the Commissioner's determination, commences it to run upon the day upon which the Board's decision becomes final.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.997" offset="10295359">It is of utmost importance that this time be specified as accurately as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.683" offset="10322108">In some instances, in order to achieve this result, the usual rules of law applicable in court procedure must be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.880" offset="10354918">For example, the power of the Court of Review to recall its mandate is made to expire 30 days from the date of the issuance of the mandate.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.298" offset="10392534">Now, that latter situation was the one with Your Honors had in the Northern Coal Company case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.406" offset="10413014">The mandate of the Court had issued 30 days or after it expired under the statute, even though that this Court's affirmance was erroneous as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.842" offset="10454706">The Court was powerless to change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.387" offset="10464946">And -- and we -- we believe that the fact that a particular taxpayer may -- may have some justifiable feelings of -- in this case, a hardship was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.294" offset="10556583">Nevertheless, the fact remains that this is a statute of limitations case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.035" offset="10575496">The petition for certiorari is filed in this Court on the 91st day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.552" offset="10597543">The Court has no jurisdiction to grant it, no matter how meritorious it is, that as to tax cases, Congress has -- has provided a system of collections in which the statute of limitation is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.033" offset="10655535">It's provided for suspension of that statute during tax court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.238" offset="10672358">The statute begins to run from -- again, from the day the Tax Court decision becomes final.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.663" offset="10698062">And that if -- if that -- if the statute were to be disregarded in a particular case because it might be considered that the result is a hard one, I would -- I would point out that the principle of finality does not merely benefit the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.405" offset="10793044">Its administration of -- of the tax law and a disposition of thousands of tax claims involving billions of dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.300" offset="10820524">It's not merely of a concern to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.905" offset="10830973">It's a -- it's concern to taxpayers generally that if -- if the Government were free to reopen the Tax Court decision or to ask that it be reopened after it became final because papers were lost or because new -- new evidence could be presented to show respect --</text>

            <text syncTime="2723.076" offset="10995649">I'd like to answer Mr. Justice Harlan's questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.555" offset="11013622">The decision of the Tax Court is equivalent to judgment in ordinary court, sometimes are entered promptly, sometimes it's quite a question of many months if there has to be a computation under the Tax Court's Rule 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.193" offset="11072136">I must admit that in the case where a single issue was decided in favor of the Government or in favor of either party that ordinarily it wouldn't take long to get the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.734" offset="11118320">But there -- it frequently happens if they're not issued immediately as counsel would indicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.476" offset="11153324">Now, the statement was made that the inference was that this -- possibly, the decision was vacated to give a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.124" offset="11191881">The fact is that this a close and difficult case on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.126" offset="11203897">As I stated, it took Ms. Harron two years and four months to decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.855" offset="11222810">We made a good showing to her as to what we have proved if we have a rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.783" offset="11242454">We put on competent witnesses who proved good important facts and -- and no doubt in the world about the sincerity of the Tax Court in -- in granting the rehearing and their effort to get the right answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.661" offset="11302013">Also, I think it's -- if I haven't already emphasized here, this Lasky who is 76 years old through no fault of his own, finds himself with a staggering deficiency with his tax with his property all subjected to tax lien and will take everything he owns if he loses this case in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.340" offset="11380694">We think that -- that this Court under its decisions could give him the right of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.712" offset="11402219">It certainly should have that vital appeal to try out the case on its merits -- on his merits.</text>
