            <text syncTime="40.372" offset="264861">In other words, the -- the Russian quota would be charged with the female petitioner's number and the Turkish quota with the male petitioner's number, so that aliens who have been waiting for a long time on those quota lists would be prejudiced.</text>

            <label>Mr. Maurice A. Roberts</label>
            <text syncTime="94.900" offset="482931">Well, there have been certain provisions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.688" offset="498082">For example, the Displaced Persons Act of 1948 which authorized the issuance of visas in fairly large numbers to nationals of countries with relatively small quotas and has permitted the issuance of these visas notwithstanding that this would exhaust the quotas but stipulated that not more than 50% of the quota for any one year should be exhausted.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>

          <turn speaker="maurice_a_roberts" startTime="124.880" stopTime="368.320">
            <label>Mr. Maurice A. Roberts</label>
            <text syncTime="124.880" offset="602885">And in -- in administering these provisions, the state department is careful not to charge all suspensions up to the remaining few quota numbers available because that would mean that no quota immigrant could get into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.318" offset="664639">One thing further before I proceed and that is the -- the standard of review available in cases like this I don't believe it is correct to say that the Board of Immigration Appeals must justify its denial of discretion to the satisfaction of a reviewing court.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.778" offset="762441">I believe the standard which has been laid down by the courts and which has been followed is that which Judge Learned Hand stated in the Second Circuit in the case of Kaloudis versus Shaughnessy, and I'm -- I'd like to quote just one brief portion from that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.126" offset="835897">That appears in the Government's brief at page 19, referring to the suspension power and you're pointing out that is a dispensary power, Judge Hand stated, "It is a matter of grace over which courts have no review, unless as we are assuming, it affirmatively appears that the denial has been actuated by considerations that Congress could not have intended to make relevant."</text>
            <text syncTime="217.202" offset="972152">And I may state that the immigration regulations did require the hearing officer to state in his opinion of the -- or to discuss in his opinion the reasons for granting or withholding relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.152" offset="1035995">There was no such requirement with respect to the Board of Immigration Appeals and in many instances, the Board simply adopts the hearing officer's opinion and merely has a one-sentence affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.831" offset="1086673">And if the Board does not state a reason for denying suspension, which is a clearly an inappropriate reason, there is really nothing for the Court to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.803" offset="1146546">Now, getting back to the reasons stated by the hearing officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.424" offset="1169115">As I have pointed out he stated that it was the fact that the petitioners had arrived within the year and that they had no close family ties.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.691" offset="1210180">And that to grant them this maximum form of relief would deprive aliens abroad who had been waiting for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.728" offset="1242258">These were reasons why the maximum discretion was denied them.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.699" offset="1274128">When the Board considered the case, it affirmed on substantially the same reasons which it stated in its initial opinion in March of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.583" offset="1329716">It adverted to the fact that the aliens had recently arrived.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.327" offset="1344658">By that time they had been here a little less than three years, instead of a little less than one year and the Board adverted -- adverted to the fact that they had arrived as seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.540" offset="1381543">But in essence it was affirming the hearing officer's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.471" offset="1413308">When counsel moved to reopen and to reconsider, the Board denied that motion on what seemed to be very substantial reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.400" offset="1460955">It pointed out in its opinion on reconsideration that it had previously denied suspension as a matter of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.311" offset="1508603">It pointed out that it had found the aliens eligible for suspension under the 1917 Act standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.980" offset="1543293">But that in the exercise of discretion it had not considered them worthy of this form of relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="370.295" offset="1584567">That is in the Board's opinion, which appears in the record at page 15, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.134" offset="1619884">At the top of the page, near the bottom of the paragraph it says, "After considering, on March 18, 1954, we dismissed the appeal from the hearing officer's decision granting voluntary departure and denying suspension of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.130" offset="1711940">After considering all the facts in the case at that time, we denied suspension of deportation as a matter of administrative discretion."</text>
            <text syncTime="409.946" offset="1743182">And then in the next paragraph the Board referred to the fact that they had indicated in their previous order that the aliens had established eligibility under the 1917 Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="668.325" offset="2776691">I believe that these were reasons of the kind that Congress took into account when it first enacted this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.431" offset="2821099">If I may develop that, the Immigration Act of 1917 and the Immigration Act of 1924, which were both effective at the same time were inflexible.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.614" offset="2893824">For the most part they required deportation of all aliens who fell within the classification stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.322" offset="2924648">And after they had been in operation for a while it was apparent that this very inflexibility resulted in extreme hardship in many instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.913" offset="2967071">For example, there was no statute of limitations in the 1924 Act with respect to aliens who entered illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.986" offset="2995284">So that as happened very frequently, an alien who had entered unlawfully after July 1st, 1924 and who have might thought that his entry was perfectly lawful, and who remained here for many years, had married an American citizen, and raised an American family, and had established deep roots in this country when he came to apply for naturalizations some years later, might find that the examiner delved into his initial arrival and found that to be unlawful and deportation proceedings were instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.148" offset="3124015">And the Secretary of Labor who then administered the immigration laws, had absolutely no discretion, had no alternative but to deport.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.851" offset="3158810">That in fact one of the items which was mentioned in the congressional debates was that with respect to criminals, aliens who were deportable as criminals, they could be relieved from deportation because either they could get a pardon or if the sentencing court recommended against deportation that was effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.794" offset="3242506">But aliens who were deportable on technical grounds and who had been here for many, many years, and had roots here could not be relieved against.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.870" offset="3278869">And throughout the debates runs this common thread, that here are aliens who are deportable on technical grounds, who have been here for many, many years, and whom we are powerless to help.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.525" offset="3333517">The Commissioner of Immigration, while various bills to alleviate this situation were pending, was requested by joint resolution to stay deportation in cases which could be helped by this type of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.753" offset="3394435">And there were some 2800 cases in which he stayed the deportation from Congress to Congress, while -- while alleviatory measures were being considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.411" offset="3453053">In his report to the Congress, he pointed out that some 59% of these aliens had been in the country for more than 10 years and I believe some 37% had been here more than five years.So that throughout the consideration by Congress was the fact that there were aliens who had been here for a long time, and who had married American citizens, and who had begotten American citizen children.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.746" offset="3586382">And there would be extreme hardship in having these people deported, especially on the narrow and technical grounds specified in the Immigration Act of 1924 because there was no statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.981" offset="3643329">And the Congress for a long time was loath to grant this discretionary power to the Secretary of Labor, even with respect to these aliens of long residence here because they were a little afraid that this might act as an incentive to other aliens abroad to try to get in here illegally likewise.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.560" offset="3725563">That's merely one of the elements that was mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.142" offset="3735907">But when the suspension legislation made it's way into the Alien Registration Act of 1940, the Board was entitled to take into account the question of recency of arrival and it did not necessarily restrict its decision to aliens who had been here for a long time, but that was one of the elements which they could consider and did consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.758" offset="3858369">And the decisions of the Board, some of which made their way into the courts on habeas corpus indicate that this was one of the factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.318" offset="3892642">Now, as the Court of Appeals pointed out in this case, Congress did specify the standards of eligibility in the 1940 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.664" offset="3937991">Those were rules of exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.381" offset="3948857">Unless the alien could bring himself within the eligible class, the Attorney General, who by this time had succeeded to the Secretary of Labor's responsibility, had no power to suspend.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.931" offset="4007058">But if the alien did bring himself within the eligible classes, this did not mean that the Attorney General was required to suspend deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.527" offset="4053452">Then it was left up to the Attorney General in his informed discretion to determine whether it should be favorably exercised and if it should be to what extent, because the 1940 Act provided two forms of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.162" offset="4112071">First, the lesser form of voluntary departure which had certain distinct advantages and then the maximum relief of suspension.</text>

            <text syncTime="1049.528" offset="4301511">But these were the minimum.</text>

            <text syncTime="1090.475" offset="4465246">The excerpt from this Section which appeared in the respondent's brief did not contain the entire Act and I should like to point this out at page 2, moving about six lines down from the opening of the quoted matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.356" offset="4548838">It says, "The Attorney General may permit the alien to depart or suspend deportation."</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.712" offset="4578200">And in the rest of that very Section, the word shall is used on seven different occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.261" offset="4608397">For example, if the Attorney General, and I'm now referring to page 3 of our brief, if the Attorney General suspends deportation for more than six months then the statute says that a detailed statement of the facts and pertinent provisions of law in the case shall be reported to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.935" offset="4687078">And if during the session of Congress or the next Congress passes a concurrent resolution, favoring the suspension, then the Attorney General shall cancel deportation proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1223.406" offset="4996995">The fact that the petitioners arrived as seamen, seamen as Your Honor understands, are granted certain privileges under the immigration laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="1304.800" offset="5322585">I should also like to point out that the factors upon which the Attorney General's discretion must be based vary from time to time and the Attorney General cannot act in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.153" offset="5372008">He cannot -- it cannot be expected to limit himself to those elements which were operative in 1940 when this legislation was enacted because much history has been written since 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.639" offset="5421955">We've had the war and -- and there were situations engendered by the war, which required the Attorney General in the exercise of his sound discretion to tighten up in certain classes of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.712" offset="5470229">And in the aftermath of the war, there were situations, the stowaway situation immediately after the close of World War II.</text>

            <text syncTime="1358.716" offset="5538252">So that these are all factors which must be weighed and since the Attorney General has the closest touch with the overall situation, Congress left that it to his informed discretion to determine under what circumstances this maximum form of relief should be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.854" offset="5626755">And as I stated the courts have held that this power is a dispensary power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.363" offset="5660818">Last year, this Court, likened it did to the power of the President in granting a pardon or the power of the Parole Board in granting parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.025" offset="5715466">And in reviewing the exercise of discretion, the Court has not set aside the administrative determination.Unless, as Judge Learned Hand pointed out, it affirmatively -- affirmatively appears that it was actuated by considerations that Congress could not have intended to make relevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1644.682" offset="6682102">There has been another case, which counsel referred to in the Second Circuit, the Mastrapasqua case, in which the Court had held that when the Board in classifying aliens and in determining aliens in various categories, who should not be granted this relief, hits upon a classification which bears no reasonable relationship to what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.693" offset="6810102">That is arbitrary and that in effect the Board fails to exercise its discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.777" offset="6842493">But apart from this, there've been any number of decisions where the courts have stated, these are matters of administrative discretion on which we shall not intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.822" offset="6886693">And in fact, some courts have suggested that -- that this type of discretion is within the second exception to the opening sentence of Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, and which states that except insofar as agency review is limited to agency discretion or -- or words to that effect, there shall be judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.651" offset="6981987">The Ninth Circuit has held to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.980" offset="6995257">I know of no decision which has stated that the Board must justify its exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.940" offset="7035173">Actually, it has been the reverse that the courts will not interfere, unless it affirmatively appears that the Board has acted upon considerations which Congress never intended to apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="2184.557" offset="8841592">And they made a very intensive study, which resulted in Senate Report 1515 which this Court has referred to in many opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.663" offset="8878059">That was an elaborate report and it dissected the operations of the immigrations laws and the manner in which the Immigration Service had administered those laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.492" offset="8933334">That study came out in 1950 while the 1917 Act was still operative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.771" offset="8962487">And as a result of that study various bills were introduced, which finally culminated and in the McCarran-Walter Act which is the 1952 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.328" offset="9000730">And its -- in its consideration of these bills, Congress had various reports in which it commented.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jay Nicholas Long</label>
            <text syncTime="2866.029" offset="11567522">I just like, if Your -- Your Honor please, to make two points out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.383" offset="11588942">First of all, Mr. Justice Brennan, had raised the question as to the factors considered by the Board in granting suspension of deportation under the Act of 1917.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.553" offset="11629589">I'd like to invite attention to pages 15, 16 and 17 of my brief, concerning the fact as that -- that they have taken into consideration because they have been quite flexible on -- on that including granting suspension of deportation to a woman who being here as a visitor, married an illegal alien one month after she was here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.473" offset="11729272">And then once a child was born applied for suspension of deportation, it was granted her.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.009" offset="11751424">And the emphasis there by the Board was on the fact that her deportation would work on incredible hardship or serious detriment to the child if its parent was taken or was sent abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.062" offset="11807640">That is just one case that I think is -- is more of an emphatic on -- in favor of the petitioners here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.989" offset="11839300">And Mr. Justice Clark concerning the question raised by you as to the cases turned down by the Congress had been recommended by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.306" offset="11892590">I would like to point out that immediately before the enactment of the -- the Act in 1952, the judiciary committees of both Houses had decided to put a clamp on the thousands of cases that were being recommended for suspension of deportation principally, in connection with aliens who had been caught here during the war and had stayed here for seven years or more and hence, were eligible for suspension of deportation under the amendment of the Act of 1948, which said that aliens here for seven years or more were eligible for that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.432" offset="12045145">And that Congress at that time in considering the Act of 1952 took the position that we are not going to place a lot of load or reap on the -- of reward of all these thousands of aliens who had successfully evaded our laws for seven years or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.749" offset="12118392">But, of course, I think that that is a very serious distinction from cases such as the one at bar where the welfare of an American citizen was the principal consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.164" offset="12159979">But the truth is that at -- at the time that the Board was considering this case, several thousand cases had been rejected by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.878" offset="12202924">And thus -- and the Board had before it the problem of trying to dispose of all of these cases administratively by way of having thrown back in their lap by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.347" offset="12248795">And I'm sure that was a very important consideration for the Board at the time that it considered this particular case, even though it did not say so in its decision.</text>
