            <text syncTime="73.339" offset="396727">This case involves a question of the taxation of income that comes to this Court from the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.548" offset="445524">The precise question presented is whether or not the petitioner here, the surviving corporation in a merger, may carry over and deduct from its income the operating losses of three corporations which were a component corporations in that merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.078" offset="519711">The facts are stipulated, fully set out in the briefs, maybe summarized very briefly here.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.754" offset="550431">Prior to 1949, there were 17 corporations, each with the name Libson as part of its name.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.010" offset="587421">Some of them were Missouri corporations, some of them were Illinois corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.520" offset="613439">They conducted retail business in 16 locations.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.213" offset="636217">The 17th corporation was a management company.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.008" offset="651368">The stock of all the corporations was owned by the same individuals in identical proportions with one nsignificant exception, that one of the corporations was the wholly-owned subsidiary of another corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.317" offset="712600">That of course doesn't vary the substantial ownership of the corporations, all of which were owned in the same proportions, add identically.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.967" offset="759202">Three of these corporations sustained net operating losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.708" offset="786160">At the end of the fiscal year in 1949, all of the corporations were merged into one corporation under the statutory provisions of the Missouri and Illinois corporation loss of the states to their incorporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.741" offset="858363">Petitioner here is the sole surviving corporation in that merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.716" offset="894203">Of course, the fact that there were 17 corporations doesn't mean that there were 17 separate businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.065" offset="927640">There were 17 accounting units conducting business at 16 locations under one common management.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.539" offset="969540">This appears to be but one business.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.264" offset="988453">Basically, the fact that it was one business is the reason for the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.130" offset="1011858">This petitioner deducted from its income consisting of the income of all the locations.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.678" offset="1038085">For the year following the merger, the net operating loss suffered in three of those locations which appeared in the accounts of its component corporation, three of its component corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.904" offset="1090957">And the only question presented here is the propriety of that deduction.</text>

            <text syncTime="734.407" offset="3041050">Now then, three taxpayers, three corporations, three accounting units suffer losses in 1948 and 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.499" offset="3077413">The statutes says that -- that these losses shall be carry-overs.</text>

            <text syncTime="767.787" offset="3174484">Now, that's the result of the statutes of Missouri, Illinois, the state statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.665" offset="3206040">An inquiry may be addressed as to whether or not the state statutes are controlling in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.738" offset="3250343">The answer to that inquiry is that they are, and the reason that the Internal Revenue Code expressly so provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.696" offset="3286183">It does so in its definition of corporation that a corporation shall include associations, trusts and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.352" offset="3324740">Of course, we all know that the word corporation includes also any organization to which a charter is granted under state law that the word corporation is not limited to an association, trust or partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.274" offset="3400495">That one individual may own all the shares of -- of a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.430" offset="3421080">In which case, there would be no association, no trust, no partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.673" offset="3438111">Nevertheless, there is a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.948" offset="3455143">So that by definition, the Internal Revenue Code adopts the state law for the determination of the existence of a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.275" offset="3504462">Having adopted that state law for the determination of existence, it's a logical necessity that the same law be looked to, to determine continuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.482" offset="3549288">Continuity, existence, corporate entity, corporate identity just aren't separable.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.795" offset="3578546">They mean the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.049" offset="3591607">Then further, taking this particular case to determine the application of state law, we find that without the application of state law, there is no basis for the very beginning statement in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.130" offset="3655868">I stated that prior to 1949, there were 17 corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.857" offset="3682826">The only reason that there were 17 corporations was that there were 17 charters issued by the States of Missouri and the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.092" offset="3727757">If we attempt to disregard the laws of the various states in determining corporate existence, corporate separateness, corporate continuity, corporate entity, we must find in this case that prior to 1949, there was only one corporation, that there was no merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.390" offset="3804975">17 corporations existed only because there were 17 charters and the state law recognized 17 separate accounting units, entity corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.559" offset="3861608">Now, this is -- has been the accepted practice of Treasury Department, of all administrative agencies since the beginning of the income tax law that any entity with a charter, organization chartered by the State as a corporation ,is necessarily a corporation regardless of whether or not it's in association, trust or partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.259" offset="3968397">So, we have the state law to -- to look to.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.087" offset="3975711">We have it adopted into the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.789" offset="3986578">We have the state law providing the kind of succession which here occurred, the kind of continuity of existence looking to the state law for the determination of existence and entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.970" offset="4043212">We must also look there for the determination of continuity and identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.197" offset="4076126">Now, we may look for a moment to the decisions pertinent to this question, particularly, the case of Helvering versus Metropolitan Edison Company.</text>

            <text syncTime="1046.944" offset="4291166">Referring first to Helvering versus Metropolitan Edison Company case, that case involved a corporation which they issued bonds for less than far, amortize the discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.059" offset="4359607">Before the bonds matured, it was merged with another corporation, questioned whether or not the other corporation, by virtue of the statutory merger, could continue the amortization answered in the affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.983" offset="4435257">The other case in this Court which touches upon the question is possibly New Colonial Ice Company, a case of a reorganization different from a merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.246" offset="4484368">It was a case in which the Colonial Ice Company incurred liabilities, found difficulty under its corporate charter, transferred all its assets to a new corporation in consideration of which the stock of the new corporation was issued to shareholders, creditors and others of old corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.487" offset="4577364">Without any exact or detailed study of whether or not a reorganization had occurred, it was held that the losses of the old corporation could not be carried forward to the new corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.675" offset="4634102">It was pointed out by the Court that the old corporation kept its charter, continued to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.094" offset="4663777">Now then, if both New Colonial Ice Company and the more recent Metropolitan Edison decision are to be accepted as correct decisions, the problem is to find the material distinction between the two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.702" offset="4726157">The difference repeatedly pointed out both in the lower courts and the Treasury Department rulings and the administrative interpretations, is that one case involved a reorganization which was not a merger, the New Colonial Ice case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.127" offset="4799927">The other case, Metropolitan Edison involved a reorganization which was a merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.855" offset="4842768">That distinction may be accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.854" offset="4858755">Without that distinction, the cases are in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.093" offset="4883728">The distinction has been accepted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.125" offset="4895848">The quotations from Congress have been set out in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.046" offset="4915597">The distinction has now been abolished by the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.469" offset="4933256">It was described as an over technical distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.655" offset="4949974">The distinction is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.271" offset="4960423">If it's accepted, it follows that in this case since a merger occurred, the loss may be carried -- carried forward under the doctrine of Metropolitan Edison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.850" offset="4998771">In another case, if it was a reorganization of a different kind, then the carry-forward might not be allowable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.183" offset="5052061">But to approach the question more generally in terms of reorganization, it may be urged that there's no real distinction between a merger and another reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.619" offset="5097827">In many cases, the same -- the -- a different technique may be used to accomplish the same end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.955" offset="5123218">This certainly is the reasoning which appealed to Congress when it enacted the Revenue Code of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.798" offset="5162611">And it may possibly be that the distinction has no materiality to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.217" offset="5188211">If that be so, then the New Colonial Ice Company case was possibly wrongly decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.788" offset="5234500">Nevertheless, it would appear that the Metropolitan Edison case expresses the preferable doctrine that if New Colonial is to be abandoned, the proper rule should be that upon succession in a reorganization, the net operating loss suffered by a predecessor corporation opt to be allowed as a carry over to its successor in a reorganization whether or not it's a component corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2148.707" offset="8698232">Nevertheless, the New Colonial case, as Congress has stated, should at least be confined to its own facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.053" offset="8727594">Let me read the statement from the congressional committee reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.270" offset="8752462">"Your Committee agrees that whether or not the items carry-over should be based upon economic realities rather than upon such artificialities as the legal form of the reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.972" offset="8799274">The new rules, speaking of the rules of the 1954 Code, enable the successor corporation to step into the tax dues of its predecessor corporation without necessarily conforming to artificial legal requirements which now exist under court-made law," speaking of the distinction made between Metropolitan Edison and New Colonial Ice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.211" offset="8884224">Congressional reports have used the same reference to pension trust deductions and numerous other kinds of deductions which may be carried forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.631" offset="8921945">They indicate that all these tax credits are to be considered in the same light.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.846" offset="8942738">In 1954, they rejected the distinction which has been made between New Colonial and Metropolitan Edison, recognized as its -- this distinction as existing prior to 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.681" offset="9018075">Whether or not this distinction can coexist with the doctrine of Gregory versus Helvering, that reorganization is a substantial thing involving continuity of the business, need not be decided here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.053" offset="9075545">The reason is that this case involves a statutory merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.691" offset="9090173">Petitioner is entitled to the credit claim under the doctrine of the Metropolitan case, whether or not the doctrine of New Colonial stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.254" offset="9132387">But at this point, to extend the doctrine of New Colonial, contrary to the -- to the settled understanding of Congress, to the expressions of the courts, the Treasury Department, the understanding of the Bar would be a rather pitiful effort against a rather broad current of judicial decision, judicial interpretation on the nature of a merger and what a merger is.</text>

            <text syncTime="2304.375" offset="9320887">Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Black have succinctly stated the Government's difficulty with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.814" offset="9354637">That is that in our view, the taxpayer's position boils down to a contention that losses realized by three separate businesses that never could, up to and including the year of the merger here under consideration, all set the income or reduce the taxes of those businesses, can as a result of the -- this merger suddenly all set to fit the income and reduce the taxes of 14 other businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.825" offset="9494653">Our position is that if this is a correct result, it's certainly one that should be set forth in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.002" offset="9523388">We don't think it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.004" offset="9531434">Now, I'd like to go back for just a second over the facts of this case since they were very briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.515" offset="9561422">The owners of these 16 retail stores and the one store supplying management to it chose to operate in the corporate form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.245" offset="9604368">They could have chosen to do it through the medium of one corporation with 17 separate divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.044" offset="9631535">They did not do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.552" offset="9641566">And if they had done it, they -- they would have been able to offset the losses of these ailing corporations against the profits of the good corporations and this case never would have arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.748" offset="9702379">But they chose to operate this business through the medium of 13 Missouri corporations and four Illinois corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.731" offset="9742294">Our counsel has stated that there would be some advantages to doing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.721" offset="9770297">They certainly wouldn't have done it if there hadn't been advantages such as limiting liability, possibly reducing state franchise taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.855" offset="9798823">And certainly, at the inception of businesses, it's well if it's possible to be able to chop them up into as many segments as possible for federal income tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.456" offset="9845217">In the years here in consideration, the lowest corporate rates were imposed upon net incomes below $25,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.569" offset="9881684">Somewhat higher rates were imposed on incomes from $25,000 to $50,000 and the highest rates were reserved for incomes in excess of $50,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="2468.412" offset="9976978">Later on, there was a change in that, but this -- it still is in effect that corporations within counts below $25,000 pay less tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.506" offset="10017416">So, it still is advantageous to chop up your businesses into small segments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.581" offset="10041657">Now, even though they chose this form for whatever advantages they realized or hoped to realize, they still could have avoided this situation by filing a consolidated federal income tax return which would have in effect ignored the separate corporate entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.952" offset="10107173">But of course, that has a disadvantage of a 2% additional surtax, and also, it has the disadvantage of giving you only one net income and loses the advantage of splitting up those incomes for the lower tax rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.411" offset="10181047">Now, three of these corporations, separate losses, two were Illinois corporations and one was a Missouri corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.864" offset="10214797">These losses qualified under the statute as net operating losses which could be carried forward to offset the income of the corporations for the next three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.019" offset="10267460">I don't believe that counsel meant to make any contention that these corporations should be ignored for federal income tax purposes so that the losses of the three ailing businesses prior to the merger could have offset the income from the other businesses prior to the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.088" offset="10339767">On August 1, 1949, these corporations went through a merger under the state laws of Missouri and Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.414" offset="10377070">As a result of that merger, the resulting corporation was a Missouri corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.078" offset="10399640">It had its name changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.540" offset="10409566">It changed and increased its authorized shares and it extended its business purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.150" offset="10431927">And the taxpayer now says, that as a result of complying with these state laws, the pre-merger losses two separate Illinois corporations and one separate Missouri corporation, can now offset the post-merger profits of a resulting Missouri corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3689.671" offset="14862085">Because in that case, that had to do with discount on bonds issued by the corporation which is in effect an interest expense because the corporation of course has to eventually redeem to that power.</text>

            <text syncTime="3744.128" offset="15079842">Now, the Metropolitan Edison Company case and distinguished -- being distinguished on that ground from the New Colonial Ice Company case, I must admit that we're not completely happy with the Metropolitan Edison case or rather than the Government's conduct in it because in that case, it was conceded that if a statutory merger took place that the deduction would have been allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.618" offset="15169808">We don't know quite why that was done on brief and unfortunately, everybody connected without debts and we can't find out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.369" offset="15196871">But we do think that probably, it was to win that case if they thought that there was not a statutory merger in the case and since some of the lower courts had gone off on the distinction between statutory mergers and other mergers, they decided to follow that and win that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.066" offset="15267610">Now, the result contended for by taxpayer here would, although it seems to be going further than any of the lower courts had gone in oral argument here, would result in these losses being allowable after a statutory merger but not after other mergers which are tax-free under the federal income tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.940" offset="15355173">A few years ago of course, a lot of States didn't allow the mergers or perhaps they didn't allow a merger with a foreign corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.658" offset="15394043">So, the federal income tax law has a practical merger which is the same effect, it's a -- an exchange of stock for assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.308" offset="15424554">And as I understand these lower court opinions in this -- on this ground, they wouldn't allow in that situation the carry-overs to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.917" offset="15463006">They look at state law, and they'd say that if it's a statutory merger under the state law, it will allow to carry-forwards, but if it's a practical merger or the tax pre-liquidation of the subsidiary, we won't allow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.298" offset="15512534">Now, that -- that seems to me that Congress usually tries to legislate uniformly throughout the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.472" offset="15537298">And if the carry forward of a net operating loss is going to depend upon the particular state law, we think that it certainly should be clearly set forth in the statute and we will see if it is.</text>

            <text syncTime="4143.158" offset="16676028">I want to say that the legislative history, we think, whatever there is in it, is slightly helpful because there's no indication that in this situation would ever be -- a loss would be allowed to be carried over.</text>

            <text syncTime="4173.504" offset="16797341">However, there has never been any regulation or any ruling with the dignity of the treasury decision that was issued covering this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4184.185" offset="16840077">There is one pension trust ruling which deals with the carry over of past service credits which are funded and therefore deducted ratably over a period just like an amortized bond discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="4198.976" offset="16899323">We think that the rule there is exactly the same as the Metropolitan Edison Company case, that it is the liability of the resulting corporation and therefore, the deduction should be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4211.819" offset="16950627">We haven't been treated too well by the lower courts in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4218.097" offset="16975809">We lost in the Second Circuit with Judge Learned Hand dissenting in 1949 and no indication ever came out from the Treasury Department that they were going to follow that case and in fact, they kept on litigating it in the Tax Court and in these cases here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4241.234" offset="17068283">I think that probably, although I might say that we're not completely "fundless" before this Court, we do have the District Court and the Eighth Circuit of course, we have Judge Wyzanksi who was overruled by the First Circuit and we have the Tax Court on our side, and we have Judge Learned Hand dissenting in the Stanton Brewery Company case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4261.852" offset="17150830">I think that probably the distinction made by the courts and the point at which there is a departure between Newmarket, Gallo and this case and others is the emphasis put on state law by those courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4278.368" offset="17216867">It's also probably an approach to the net operating loss carry-over provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4284.963" offset="17243199">Now, we say that it is a deduction, that it is a short departure from the annual accounting periods, and that therefore, it should be construed now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4297.882" offset="17294921">Some of the lower courts seemed to feel that it is a relief provision and should be construed rather broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4304.583" offset="17321671">I think that is possibly that all I can get from the interpretation of the lower court, plus the fact that they think that the New Colonial case was -- might have been overruled or certainly is inapplicable after the Metropolitan Edison Company case which we don't think so at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4326.535" offset="17409546">I can do now in part or in closing in reading part of the dissent from Judge Learned Hand's opinion which I think pretty well sums up our position here.</text>

            <text syncTime="4352.041" offset="17511528">And he says, “A statute so intricate and detailed such as this means little latitude for interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4359.484" offset="17541308">Moreover, I do not think that it is more consistent with any declared purpose that I can find to extend the privilege to a -- of a carry-over to the taxpayer far.</text>
            <text syncTime="4371.296" offset="17588537">Indeed, as a decision cited in my brother's opinion show, privilege is closely akin on purpose to this are ordinary laws by transfers from one corporation to another.</text>

            <text syncTime="4559.373" offset="18340864">First, the question of when the corporations were organized in the first instance, appears at the record at page 14 and it appears that all of the 17, except one were organized on the same date, on January 2nd, 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.703" offset="18414216">And the 17th, one of the 16 operating corporations came in later about two years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="4587.156" offset="18452041">I think that may have affected the picture of the -- of the organization of the enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4594.141" offset="18479940">Second question that was raised on the facts is the question of the change in the purposes of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4602.691" offset="18514108">I think it was indicated by counsel for the Government that he was aware of no material change in the charter and it is clear from the record at Page 15 that the management corporation, the petitioner, which is the surviving corporation, was authorized to engage in the business of selling of the commodity in question prior to the --</text>

            <text syncTime="4635.642" offset="18645974">Prior to that time, it simply acted as a supervisory corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4642.685" offset="18674082">Now, the question of the -- the basic problem here as -- as indicated maybe discussed in terms of the two facets to the Government's objection to the allowance of the carry-over in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4659.019" offset="18739493">The one facet has to do with the concept of the same taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4666.025" offset="18767496">The statute of course uses the expression "taxpayer" and the Government contends that petitioner is not the taxpayer who suffered any of the losses in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4678.652" offset="18817964">Now, we take the position of that argument, falls as soon as we bring into the -- into the discussion the concept of statutory merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="4691.260" offset="18868433">We rely upon that as in itself answering the Government's objection that we do not have the same taxpayer here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.764" offset="18902392">Because once we bring into the discussion the concept of statutory merger, we bring in all that goes with it including the notion that in a merger, the corporate existence with each of the components continues in the survivor.</text>

            <text syncTime="4805.863" offset="19326830">But the -- the concept of mergers that all the rights and all the -- all the obligations carry over and that that being the -- that -- that is incidentally is the -- the basis of the theory of the decision of this Court in Metropolitan Edison Company which did not involve a carry-over but which involved a tax benefit, which prior to the merger adhered to the component corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4827.887" offset="19414915">And the expression used by this Court was that the concept of the merger is such that the corporate identity of each component is drowned in the personality of the survivor or absorbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4841.004" offset="19467368">It's -- to be sure it's a metaphor, it's a tenuous concept but it nevertheless is a well-recognized concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="4847.172" offset="19492028">And so that, we feel that that in itself is the answer to the first class that's over the Government's objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4852.830" offset="19514702">The objection, you do not have the taxpayer who suffered the loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="4856.422" offset="19529017">Now, to be sure, the Government does press its second facet and the reason it does express it is because it feels that the second facet enables it to distinguish Newmarket, for example, which did not involve the problem of -- of the operation of -- of different assets by the surviving corporation from those who are operated by the component.</text>
            <text syncTime="4884.850" offset="19642807">Now, there was only one operating corporation in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4888.845" offset="19658794">But now, we feel that the Government's continuity argument is also -- can be -- can also be answered if we consider it carefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="4900.210" offset="19704247">The -- the argument in the brief was really made with three different levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="4905.838" offset="19726712">The Government begins by pointing to the committee report, the 1939 Committee Report, which was issued in connection with this enactment of this legislation and it picks up a quotation to the effect that this statute, the Section 122, permits a business to average its income over a period of years for tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4928.997" offset="19819395">And the Government suggests that the intention was to limit the right to the carry-over to that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4936.239" offset="19848338">The -- but it is submitted that that is of course the most irritable case, the ordinary case uncomplicated by any form of statutory reorganization for the merger or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4945.806" offset="19886582">And to be sure, if John Jones operates a business and suffers losses in the year one, the statute permits him to carry over those losses and offset them against profits earned in year two.</text>
            <text syncTime="4959.560" offset="19941648">But certainly, that is not the limit of the -- that was conferred by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.098" offset="19963800">We may consider the next case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4967.488" offset="19973308">The case where (a) one operator, a corporation or otherwise has two separate businesses in the sense of two different accounting unit, different operation, perhaps a shoe store and -- and some other kind of a store.</text>
            <text syncTime="4982.029" offset="20031509">Now, it -- it may be asked in such a case which is the next most advanced case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4987.184" offset="20052093">Can he offset the losses of one of these accounting units against the profits of another?</text>
            <text syncTime="4993.444" offset="20077171">Can he carry forward the losses and allow such as against the profits for the other in the subsequent hearing?</text>
            <text syncTime="4998.795" offset="20098591">And the Government, in its brief, is compelled to answer that it -- that it make.</text>
            <text syncTime="5003.728" offset="20118235">Well, the Government indeed has argued that that too is improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="5008.229" offset="20136312">But even the Tax Court as without any deviation rejected the notion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5014.523" offset="20161494">If there is anything in the statute which associates the right to the carry-over with their particular business operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5021.997" offset="20191378">The statute is termed in -- phrased in terms of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5026.430" offset="20209142">So that really, the -- the only issue here is whether we are correct in our proposition that the petitioner is the taxpayer with respect to the losses of each of the components.</text>
            <text syncTime="5040.948" offset="20267133">Now then, if I may continue the same analysis then I'll bring you on something that was developed earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="5046.133" offset="20287927">Put the case of a -- of a reorganization, a merger in which as one of the justices suggested, the -- the surviving corporation is the loss corporation, the corporation which prior to the merger has the losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5061.657" offset="20349994">Counsel for the Government was compelled to admit that there is no question but what under the very words of the statute, the carry-over would be allowed in such a case because the surviving corporation is -- he has to admit the taxpayer apart from the fact that it may be in such a case that the process of the subsequent juror against which this surviving corporation is going to accept the earlier losses, are not derived from assets which were formally operated by that loss corporation but were derived from other assets that were formally operated by the component corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5098.905" offset="20498996">It's just a converse of our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5101.105" offset="20507773">As Justice Harlan indicated, it would seem to be a ridiculous artificiality to think that Congress would contemplate that result and at the same time contemplate the -- the opposite result in the -- in the case at bar.</text>

            <text syncTime="5116.064" offset="20567646">I didn't mean to quote you, paraphrasing it and practically carried away to a point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5123.852" offset="20598784">Now, that is -- that is one way in which the Government has tried to develop as argument of -- of the second facet of its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5133.054" offset="20635564">The other level at which it has argued this facet is the level of the decided cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5138.923" offset="20659075">Here, it has pointed to the case of New Colonial Ice Company and picked up the phrase "continuity of business" that was used in that -- by the Court in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5149.808" offset="20702647">That case if you will recall was a case, is the case -- not a merger but of a reorganization which a -- in which a new corporation was formed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5156.620" offset="20729814">And the Court -- and the Supreme Court in that case made it very clear that the reason why the carry over was not allowed was because there was a new corporation formed, and because it was not a statutory merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="5168.666" offset="20778088">The language used was, "This transfer was not by operation of law but by contract, therefore, you do not have the same taxpayer the second."</text>
            <text syncTime="5178.292" offset="20816541">And thus, clearly distinguishing our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5181.852" offset="20830751">Now, that phrase "continuity of business" was taken out of context.</text>
            <text syncTime="5185.462" offset="20845171">The Government argues that since the phrase "continuity of business" was used there, do not necessarily mean something that is not present here, but it's not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="5196.120" offset="20887803">It's submitted that there's continuity of business here in the same sense in which there was continuity of business in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5202.978" offset="20915284">The sense in which the term was used there was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5206.282" offset="20928449">The business operations formerly conducted by the loss corporation continued to be conducted by the new corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5213.632" offset="20957915">Continuity in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5215.698" offset="20966170">Now, in the same sense, there is continuity here because the surviving corporation continues to operate the business assets formerly operated by the three loss corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5225.442" offset="21005145">The fact that it also operates additional assets formerly operated by other components does detract from the argument that there is continuity of the operation of the business which would result.</text>
            <text syncTime="5237.852" offset="21054777">And in the same way, the Government picks up a phrase in the Stanton Brewery case in its brief, the phrase "continuity of enterprise," and suggests again that it means identity of enterprise, identity of scope of the business before and after of the business which produced losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5253.318" offset="21116635">And that against those profits the losses are upsetting.</text>
            <text syncTime="5256.777" offset="21130428">Again, that is demonstrative false analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5260.789" offset="21146520">And then turning to the final level of the Government's argument and this is something that I really want to mention because it again has been brought out by counsel for the Government here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5272.021" offset="21191450">Well, the concept of tax avoidance is introduced and it's quite extraneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="5277.198" offset="21212139">It's evident from the record that there is no question of tax avoidance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.589" offset="21233768">Counsel suggests that if this result is permitted to obtain, there is a tax avoidance problem which this Court must take responsibility for.</text>
            <text syncTime="5290.896" offset="21266996">Of course he himself admits that it is -- even if he sees it, it's narrow in scope because the 1954 legislation allows the carry-over in this very situation, so it would apply only two years, affected by the 1939 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="5303.064" offset="21315584">But over and above that, Congress in the 1939 Code in Section 129, addressed itself for the very problem of tax avoidance which might be inherent in this situation when it provided that when an outsider steps in and acquires a lost corporation, when new interest come into the picture and acquire a loss corporation for a purpose of tax avoidance, then a loss carry-over is not permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5329.823" offset="21422686">And there -- there of course -- of course there's no such case here as we have no change in ownership, no question of outside interest acquiring a -- a business for the purpose of utilizing that loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="5341.011" offset="21467408">So that again, the Government's argument at the level of the appeal to -- to some concept of justice and tax avoidance is without merit.</text>

            <text syncTime="5528.287" offset="22216495">As counsel for petitioner pointed out in the first part -- part of our argument, it is not that case at all because the Internal Revenue Code itself, the whole Code necessarily incorporates the -- the private corporation law of the several states whenever it speaks for the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5546.611" offset="22289847">And it incorporates -- the corporation law for that purpose, it must be incorporated for the purpose of the -- of statutory merger which is a familiar concept and which is used in the code without definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5557.954" offset="22335195">The code in the reorganization section includes the statutory merger as one of the kinds of reorganization, a tax-free reorganization without bothering to define the term.</text>
