            <text syncTime="13.125" offset="155878">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.348" offset="164760">This case presents the question as to whether the trustees of a collectively bargained multi-employer health and welfare trust funds have the right to collect under a Miller Act payment bond, contributions which a federal public works contractor agreed in a collective-bargaining agreement to make into the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.321" offset="284609">It comes to this Court by certiorari after a summary judgment was entered in the District Court against the trustees and in favor of the surety and after that judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.978" offset="355244">Each of the courts below held that petitioners do not have the right to recover because it would be necessary in order to give that right to use the words of the District Court to stretch the terms of the statute far beyond the limits of its objectives and purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.529" offset="469452">I think then to present this matter to the Court, I should start with the language of the statute, the pertinent portion of it, which is set forth in the appendix to our opening brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.882" offset="538937">By that statute which is entitled an act for the protection of persons furnishing material and labor, for the construction, alteration or repair of said public buildings or public work, Section 1 (a) (2) provides that the contractor for public work having a value of $2000 or more shall provide a payment bond with a surety or sureties satisfactory to such officer for the protection of all persons supplying labor and material in the prosecution of the work provided for in the said contract for the use of each such person.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.457" offset="745200">Section 2 (a) of the Act provides in pertinent part, "Every person who has furnished labor or material in the prosecution of the work provided for in such contract in respect to which a payment bond is furnished under this Act and who has not been paid in full therefore, before the expiration of a period of 90 days after the day on which the last of the labor was done or performed by him or material was furnished or supplied by him for which such claim is made, shall have the right to sue on such payment bond for the amount or the balance thereof unpaid at the time of institution of such suit and to prosecute said action to final execution and judgment for the sum or sums justly due him."</text>
            <text syncTime="211.850" offset="950732">The courts below have emphasized certain of the literal language of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.110" offset="975809">We wish to present to the Court the contentions that in order to meet the literal words of the statute, it is necessary to hold that we as trustees for the laborers are entitled to recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.002" offset="1043414">I emphasize the language that the bond is for the protection of those who have furnished labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.330" offset="1076642">As I will develop in my argument, contributions for which we sue are a part of the consideration agreed to be paid for the labor of the laborers who are entitled to the benefit of this fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.668" offset="1134007">And that in order to give them the protection that they are entitled under the statute, it is necessary to hold that these contributions are within the coverage of the payment bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.833" offset="1186670">I point further to the language of the second section which says, "Gives the right of action to anyone who has furnished labor and who has not been paid in full therefore."</text>
            <text syncTime="286.175" offset="1248110">And I emphasize to the Court that because of the nature of these contributions, as a part of the consideration for the labor being performed by the laborers on these public projects, the laborer has not been paid in full, unless the Court recognizes that the trustees or the laborer, who are the petitioners in this action, are entitled to the protection of the bond and the security of the bond for the payment of the portion of the laborer's consideration which has agreed -- in which the contractor agreed to pay into the fund.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.143" offset="1487914">Well, that -- in -- in the logical course of my argument just this day, I'll reach that.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.053" offset="1515604">This trust agreement which is Exhibit C to the statement of facts on which -- which appears at page 21 of the record is a pamphlet.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.733" offset="1606301">It's entitled a trust agreement for the laborers' health and welfare trust fund for Northern California.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.746" offset="1638379">It is dated March 4th, 1953 and it is between two chapters of the Associated General Contractors of America as employers in the Northern California District Council of Hod Carriers, Building and Construction Laborers of the International Hod Carriers, Building and Common Laborers' Union of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.036" offset="1727509">It recites -- recites the existence of certain collective-bargaining agreements between the employers and the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.425" offset="1765021">Those -- the existence of those collective-bargaining agreements is likewise alleged in the complaint and admitted on the stipulation on which the summary judgment was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.559" offset="1825625">On page 2 of the document, the collective-bargaining agreements are further identified as being master agreements between the two agency chapters and the union which is the District Council of Laborers.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.104" offset="1899813">And at the end of the agreement, I further point out that those collective-bargaining agreements are identified as 46 Northern California Counties collective-bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.607" offset="1953834">And the significance of that is that the agreements cover the entire 46 counties of Northern California, an area which is in excess in size of the entire New England States and one-half of the State of New York, an area which stretches 400 miles from the Oregon border to the northern border of Kern County.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.188" offset="2052159">The signatories to that agreement on behalf of the union is a Northern California District Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.581" offset="2089671">That Council is a council of individual labor unions which have territorial jurisdiction within the 46 counties, which have bonded themselves together for the purpose of dealing with the construction contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.745" offset="2154350">The signatories for the employer are the Northern California Chapter of the Associated General Contractors of America and the Central California Chapter, the Associated General Contractors of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.379" offset="2200848">Those are associations of general contractors who have territorial jurisdiction corresponding to the territorial jurisdiction of the Laborers' District Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.701" offset="2246196">In other words, their jurisdiction for the employers stands over the 46 counties in Northern California.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.047" offset="2275558">Their membership is approximately 500 general contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.121" offset="2291858">They performed by far the greater portion of the construction work that is performed in the northern counties of California and probably, with few if any exceptions, perform all of the major public work.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.457" offset="2357164">And they employ in doing that work, the vast majority of the laborers who are covered by the collective-bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.781" offset="2390497">Your Honors will note on page 21 of this pamphlet that there is a list of signatory associations which identified by the names that they used, appear to be General Contractors Associations and Builder -- Builder Associations, which have membership throughout the 46 counties and who signed the collective-bargaining agreements, as well as signing this trust agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.778" offset="2502510">They bring in within the scope of the collective-bargaining unit approximately a thousand or more contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.736" offset="2538350">And then in the process of collective bargaining in this area, the Laborers' District Council makes individual agreements which are referred to in Article 9 of this trust agreement on page 19, whereby they affiliate with this bargaining unit individual contractors who are not members of the association by securing by -- of any of the signatory associations, by securing the individual signatures of the contractors to what are designated memorandum agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.667" offset="2690069">They adopt for laborers employed by those contractors, the terms and conditions of the master agreement that is referred to in the trust agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="716.916" offset="2971042">One, two, three, four names down on the left-hand side on page 21 and the allegation concerning the contractor's affiliation is at page 7 of the transcript where we allege that the Associated Home Builders of Sacramento of which defendant, Donald G. Carter, was at all times -- at all relevant times a member in good standing, signed said trust agreement and ratify and improved one of said collective-bargaining agreements for and on behalf of, and as the agent for the members of said association including defendant, Donald G. Carter, doing businesses for the construction company.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.338" offset="3140733">In other words, he was bound by virtue of his membership in an association which is a signatory association not only to the trust agreement but also to a collective-bargaining agreement which provided for the establishment of the trust and which provided for the payments into the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.907" offset="3206980">And it is the obligation of Carter under that action on the part of his association binding into the collective-bargaining agreement that furnishes the basis for the suit that is -- has been filed by the trustees.</text>

            <text syncTime="887.914" offset="3655032">And I want to emphasize "with respect to whose work such payments are made" because that is significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.672" offset="3678020">We were not saying that they are not to be considered wages in a general sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.458" offset="3693171">We were saying that they were not to be deemed wages due to the individual whose work was involved and no employee shall be entitled to receive any part of the contributions made or required to be made to the fund in lieu of the benefits provided by the health and welfare plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.654" offset="3753984">Now, the significance of that provision, Your Honors, is that in order to set up this trust to provide health and welfare benefits of a very substantial nature, $2000 life insurance and additional $2000 for accident -- accidental death, complete -- practically complete hospitalization, medical and surgical treatment for the laborer and his dependents.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.822" offset="3866624">It was necessary to establish eligibility rules under which there would be some laborers who would perform work for which money would be paid into the fund but would not entitle the laborer to draw benefits, to have that coverage of the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.276" offset="3936528">In other words, under the eligibility rules as pointed in the brief, established by the trustee, a laborer had to work 400 hours within a six-month period before he would be entitled to the benefits of the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.429" offset="3997132">On the other hand, if he worked 600 hours or 800 hours during a six-month period, he got no more in benefits than the man who performed only 400 hours of work, so that you had at least two -- three categories of men.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.270" offset="4072469">You would have those who worked only 400 hours who have the minimum to qualify them.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.623" offset="4101831">You have the man who doesn't work 400 hours, who is not qualified during that particular six-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.390" offset="4128893">And you have a man who works 800 hours, who you might say has had a sum which is more than necessary to provide him with the benefits that are provided in the fund.</text>

            <text syncTime="1019.671" offset="4182079">But the way it has -- it operates is that the trustees pay a premium for the insurance that is provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.645" offset="4217919">That premium is an excess of the $80 a month, a -- a year that is paid in for the man who works the very minimum of 800 hours in a year or 400 hours in the six-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.443" offset="4265148">But that increased benefit or ability to buy benefits comes from the man who works more than the minimum hours, it comes from the man that works less than the minimum hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.847" offset="4326797">But the great bulk of the laborers in this collective bargaining unit do get covered by the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.677" offset="4358040">In other words, the eligibility rules are low enough so that every man with -- who's -- who's recently working in the industry gets a coverage and every -- and the trustee whole nature of the fund enables there to -- to be a fund which provides definite benefits to all the employees covered in the unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.524" offset="4465455">And its -- every man who works in that unit has the opportunity to acquire the benefits of those funds by working the 400 hours.</text>

            <text syncTime="1168.145" offset="4775999">In order to have it established, to provide the substantial benefits that are provided and it -- was necessary in the judgment of the trustees to establish minimum work requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.656" offset="4825945">And to my knowledge, every trust fund certainly in the health and in the construction industry does have minimum work requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.251" offset="4860426">But the man who performs the labor, nevertheless, has the benefit of it because it's an established fund which he can -- by performing 400 hours of work, get the benefits of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.921" offset="4923016">And I want to point out to Your Honor that this is a matter of collective-bargaining under the statute, under the National Labor Relations Act with the Wagner Act which was enacted at the same time, same session the Miller Act was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.881" offset="4974947">The employers are obligated under law to be with the Laborers District Council and with them alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.377" offset="5004831">In other words, this particular benefit being within the scope of collective bargaining has held by the Courts of Appeal, and this Court has denied certiorari, is one on which the contractor could not make an arrangement with his -- his own employees, the laborers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.572" offset="5085706">His arrangement must be with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.199" offset="5096155">Now, the union in order to establish a health and welfare fund that would be sound and workable in the construction industry with its casual type of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.363" offset="5136802">In the exercise, we submit, of the authority which this Court has recognized in cases like Ford Motor Company against Huffman has determined that it is a proper matter to provide that the money of tens -- 7 1/2 cents per hour shall be paid into the fund, two trustees, who then, under the authority given in the trust agreement, can provide reasonable and nondiscriminatory eligibility rules under which it is possible that some laborers who do not work sufficient hours will not receive benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.951" offset="5295208">But the great majority of the laborers within the unit are able to work the 400 hours and do receive the benefit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1371.364" offset="5588825">The union has set in its negotiations with the employers and by its contract with the employers that such payments shall go to the trustees and that they shall have the power and authority to enforce these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.996" offset="5651310">And I want to bring out on other point which was emphasized by respondents in the lower court and which they -- that was -- were raised before Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.899" offset="5691016">The man received the benefit of a contribution that was -- should be made under a collective-bargaining agreement even though the contribution is actually in default.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.637" offset="5741902">In other words, the man who worked on Carter's project received the benefit of the money that was due from Carter even though Carter to this date has not paid it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.995" offset="5787355">For this reason, these are trustees by the collective-bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.780" offset="5810448">They have been given the power and authority to enforce this portion of the collective-bargaining agreement, the obligation to pay into the fund.</text>
