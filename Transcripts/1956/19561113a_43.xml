            <label>Mr. Oscar H. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="20.904" offset="187016">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.637" offset="197883">This is an immigration case from the District of Columbia Circuit and it presents the Court for the seventh time in six years with an issue of whether an immigration order may be reviewed by declaratory judgment or as the Government contends in this case by habeas corpus alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.980" offset="283251">I said for the seventh time in six years but I hasten to add that it comes up in a new context in this case because the issue here is whether an exclusion order for an acknowledged alien was never been in this country who seeks to enter the country, an exclusion order can be judicially reviewed by declaratory judgment as the District Court of Columbia Circuit held or whether it can be reviewed only in proceedings for habeas corpus as we contend.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.502" offset="393383">The background of the case is this, in a -- in a prior case involving this same respondent Tom We Shung in December 1953, three years ago, the Court held per curiam that an exclusion order under the prior Act under the Immigration Act of 1917 up to the time of the 1952 Act could be reviewed judicially only by habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.194" offset="492126">In the spring of 1955, I should add in relation to that that the Court had made the same holding in relation to deportation orders under the prior statute in a case called Heikkila against Barber.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.287" offset="540505">But then the issue arose under the new Act, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 and it came up first to this Court in a deportation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.001" offset="571329">In the spring of 1955, in Shaughnessy against Pedreiro, the Court held that the 1952 Act made a difference that under the 1952 Act deportation orders are reviewable by declaratory judgment as well as by habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.839" offset="638725">The issue here is whether the same holding should be made as to exclusion orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.356" offset="660773">The court below and respondent contend that this a case of course of the hide going with the hair that exclusion orders are governed by the same principles as deportation orders and our position is to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.164" offset="708002">And we think that exclusion orders are different from deportation orders under the 1952 statute for four different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.408" offset="741021">One, that the particular statutory provisions and the general statutory context are different for exclusion as distinguished from deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.973" offset="775293">And two, that there is a historic constitutional and legal difference between alien seeking to enter the country and those aliens resident in the country that there was a historic legal and constitutional difference between exclusion and deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.281" offset="832449">And third, we suggest that there are -- that the specific legislative history of the 1952 Act dealing with this particular subject is different with respect to exclusion and it was for deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.271" offset="880410">Fourth and lastly, we think that the practical considerations which moved the Court in the Pedreiro case to hold that deportation could be reviewable by declaratory judgment do not exist with respect to an alien seeking to enter the country and therefore the result should be different.</text>

            <label>Mr. Oscar H. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="247.982" offset="1095346">As to deportation, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.010" offset="1099421">There was no difference because the 1952 statute incorporates in haec verba, the substantial evidence rule at the deportation orders that requires the deportation orders must be based upon substantial prevalent of evidence and we could not.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.229" offset="1156263">And we cound not end the declaratory judgment statute and Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act lay down the same standard for review, substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.458" offset="1209240">In the light of that we could not say that the scope of review of a deportation order under the 1952 statute would be different in habeas corpus from what it was in declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.192" offset="1256155">But I make -- do not make the same concession here.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.473" offset="1269217">With respect to exclusion, the 1952 statute does not contain anywhere near the same restrictions that it does with respect to deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.766" offset="1302444">In particular, it does not say that the order has to be based on substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.333" offset="1324701">And historically, the review of -- by courts of exclusion orders has been -- we think in actual practice narrower in habeas corpus as they've always been reviewed up to now, narrower than it has been in deportation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.831" offset="1382693">In the very beginning when -- when these issues first arose in the late 1880's and 1890's, the Court said flatly that there would be no review of the facts at all and they adhered to that position even -- even supporting judgments below where the District Court had refused even to -- to admit any facts into evidence at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.625" offset="1457821">All that was submitted was the order of -- of the immigration officer excluding the alien.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="343.264" offset="1476420">Well, was it -- was that true when it involved a claim of citizenship?</text>

          <turn speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="347.074" stopTime="565.208">
            <label>Mr. Oscar H. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="347.074" offset="1491675">No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.142" offset="1495960">It -- the claim of citizenship was different.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.806" offset="1510588">But I point out here that there was no claim of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.092" offset="1519783">This is an alien who claims to be an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.455" offset="1529187">There is no claim of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.841" offset="1538696">One of my arguments is that if -- if Tom We Shung had claimed to be a citizen under the new Act, Section 360 which is piecemeal reproduced part in the appendix to the Government's brief and part in the appendix to respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.449" offset="1597210">If Tom We Shung had claimed to be a citizen the 1952 statute made it absolutely clear that he would have to proceed by habeas corpus because the -- that Section 360 says that if a person claims to be an American citizen who is outside the country, he must seek a certificate of identity from the Secretary of State and proceed to this country and then he shall be treated as -- in admission proceedings and the statute says specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.459" offset="1709223">He can test the order of exclusion by habeas corpus -- habeas corpus and not otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.816" offset="1734614">Even if he's in this country, even if he's in the United States, the statute says that he cannot use declaratory judgment proceeding if the issue of his nationality arose in an exclusion proceeding under the 1952 statute or the preceding statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.766" offset="1802428">And so if I may anticipate my arguments somewhat, it is a prime point of our -- of our position here that Congress very specifically in the 1952 statute said as to -- a citizen claimants, people who come from abroad and claim American citizenship they must proceed by habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.654" offset="1874004">And of course, we draw the corollary that it was highly unlikely that Congress would have provided that -- as to persons who are admitted aliens, acknowledged aliens who make no claim to citizenship that they would have not only a different remedy but two remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.042" offset="1931577">They would have the declaratory judgment remedy and also the habeas corpus remedy which would be available to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.806" offset="1962611">The court below, the District of Columbia Circuit handle this problem by simply saying that Tom We Shung is -- is an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.915" offset="1999078">He's not an applicant for citizenship and therefore Section 360, the particular section I've been talking about Mr. Justice Reed didn't apply to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.445" offset="2037112">This is a little reminiscent in our mind of -- of something that Justice Holmes said on Circuit in the Johnson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.047" offset="2071594">He said that the Court shouldn't act, shouldn't tell Congress or legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.817" offset="2090611">We know what you are driving after because you didn't say it in express terms in haec verba, we will refuse to apply what you have said.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.838" offset="2126764">As I said I've anticipated my argument which is in -- in large part based on the fact that as to citizenship claimants coming from abroad or even in this country whose claims for nationality is disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.193" offset="2176188">They have to go through the rule of habeas corpus and it's unlikely that Congress would provide another remedy, a broader remedy and a duplicate remedy for aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.691" offset="2214118">But I should like to point out that -- that Tom We Shung is definitely an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.112" offset="2231777">He applied for admission at San Francisco in November 1947, some nine years ago and this is in part one of the -- the practical differences that the Government sees, Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.940" offset="2287156">There are special reasons why this -- this case has been on litigation for nine years.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.522" offset="2305442">And one of the reasons is that Congress changed the statute in the middle.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.392" offset="2320906">But I think it's fair to say that an alien who proceeds by the rule of habeas corpus will have a greater time in litigation than he who proceeds by habeas corpus.</text>

            <text syncTime="572.446" offset="2393109">Habeas corpus by the rules of most of the district is required to be heard promptly within five days because it's a great writ which is I think that even under the statute required to be very promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.380" offset="2436890">It is disposed up promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.755" offset="2442428">Appeals are expedited.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.132" offset="2447862">And the whole matter is -- is decided very quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.685" offset="2462072">Declaratory judgment is an ordinary civil action which goes on the regular roles of the Court, regular calendars and is heard in do course.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.210" offset="2500211">And in those -- in those districts like the District of Columbia where the -- the District Court is necessarily behind, it will be heard possibly one, two or three years in -- and added number comes up on the calendar.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.838" offset="2558725">That is a very important difference that there is a speed -- speed and determination of litigation on the habeas corpus which does not generally exist under declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.381" offset="2600939">And it's always been stressed by this Court going back again to the early cases that with relation to exclusion, with relations to aliens who -- with aliens who are knocking at our gates, Congress wanted speedy summary determination and they didn't want repeated rehearings.</text>

            <text syncTime="813.951" offset="3359222">At the outset, I said that the Government feels that there are four differences with respect to reviewability between deportation orders and exclusion orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.050" offset="3395584">First, the particular statutory provisions and their context.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.020" offset="3411466">Second, the history of exclusion as distinguishing deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.356" offset="3428812">Third, the specific legislative history of the 1952 statute relating to reviewability.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.105" offset="3451800">And fourth, the practical considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.648" offset="3461935">I touched on -- I think all four of those but except possibly this specific legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.025" offset="3483460">But if I may I would like to go little further into each of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.647" offset="3497984">First, as to the statutory provisions in the 1952 Act and the statutory context, the provision relating to reviewability or at least the provision on which the Government relied relating to reviewability for deportation order say specifically that the -- it says solely that the order of the Attorney General relating to deportation shall be fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.424" offset="3585024">Now, the provision relating to exclusion is somewhat different.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.025" offset="3599444">It provides that the order of the special inquiry officer, the lowest administrative official shall be final except it shall enlist it as reverse on appeal to the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.323" offset="3644688">Now, this difference is not new to the 1952 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.093" offset="3663705">It came in the beginning of the Immigration Act in the 1890s.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.782" offset="3682513">As to exclusion, as to admission or exclusion of alien seeking to enter the country, the provision has always been that the decision of the immigration authority at the -- at the post, on appeal shall be final unless reversed on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.959" offset="3743222">And the Courts, this Court invoking this provision has made note of the fact in the early cases for instance such as Nishimura Ekiu and Lem Moon Sing, the Court there said Congress provided a method of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.088" offset="3799751">It didn't provide court review.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.862" offset="3806856">It provided an administrative review on appeal to the Head of the Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.164" offset="3823992">First, it was the Secretary of the Treasury and on the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, Secretary of Labor, and now the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.018" offset="3851473">Then there are certain exceptions even for appeals to the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.803" offset="3878536">In certain security cases, the statute gives specific authority to the special inquiry officer to hold the man at the door and provides for the sending up of the case to the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.676" offset="3930049">In that -- in that case, the statute specifically says that there shall be no appeal to the Attorney General of the decision as to temporary exclusion by the special inquiry officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.681" offset="3974144">There are also special medical cases in which the decision of the local inquiry officer shall be final without appeal to the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.708" offset="4018239">Thirdly, there are cases in which -- in which Congress has adopted in the 1952 statute a provision specifically saying that the Attorney General can bar alien seeking admission on the basis of confidential information and without a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.852" offset="4082813">That is specific in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.585" offset="4097755">If you take all these provisions together, it seems unlikely that Congress was intending to expand judicial review for excluded aliens over what had been existent under the statute since the beginning of the immigration and legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.901" offset="4158986">And that's what we think you have to find in the 1952 statute to - to say that there shall be review by declaratory judgment rather than by habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.022" offset="4195453">As to deportation, the Court did find it but we think it cannot find it as to exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.875" offset="4218859">I've mentioned and I express again because we think it very important the provision of Section 360 which provides the claimants to citizenship must go by the route of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.730" offset="4262327">That is very specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.267" offset="4268492">And Congress, we think there made it very clear for a defined reason under the earlier statute, the Nationality Act of 1940, claims to citizenship, both within and without the country could bring a declaratory judgment action against the Secretary of State or the Attorney General or some other official who was denying on the right on the ground that they were not American citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.150" offset="4359920">And a large number of declaratory judgment actions were brought under that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.128" offset="4379878">Congress felt that that provision was being misused particularly as a legislative history reveals by Chinese who were claiming a derivative citizenship through the paternity -- alleged paternity of American citizens of Chinese descent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.939" offset="4439124">And so on the 1952 Act came to be passed, Congress repealled the old provision for declaratory judgment and established this new provision, Section 360, which provided that for persons within the United States declaratory judgment could continue except -- except if the issue of nationality arose or had arisen in an exclusion proceeding and -- in those circumstances, declaratory judgment could not be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.048" offset="4551555">Also, it provided that –-</text>

            <text syncTime="1159.753" offset="4742353">There are also other differences in the statute between exclusion and deportation some of which I have mentioned which we think all bind together to indicate that the system of review for deportation was changed but the system of review for exclusion remain what it had historically been since the late 1880s.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.537" offset="4813511">The hearing procedure is very different as I mentioned before lunch.</text>

            <text syncTime="1778.254" offset="7216358">He was seeking to come to this country because he was the son of an American citizen and the War Brides Act gave him a special non-quota privilege to come in.</text>

            <text syncTime="1794.906" offset="7283022">And as the Court mentioned in -- in your opinion for the Court in the Pedreiro case, there is no disruption of -- of the alien's life in the country by requiring him to seek his review by habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.086" offset="7331715">He's outside the country.</text>

            <text syncTime="1816.353" offset="7368808">He must bring his declaratory judgment action from outside the country and -- so he never enters the country and that is in its sense another difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.914" offset="7411022">There were last year a 160,000 aliens who were not admitted, who were refused admission to this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.678" offset="7438085">Most of them did not have formal hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.627" offset="7445922">I think they're only about between four and two -- 4,000 formal hearings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2504.044" offset="10119502">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.709" offset="10126190">The principle question presented here is not as stated by the petitioner as to whether the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 authorizes judicial review other than habeas corpus in an exclusion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.665" offset="10206020">But the question, the principal question is whether the Immigration and Nationality Act precludes the use of a declaratory judgment action in an exclusion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.474" offset="10265266">We contend that the court below has correctly followed this Court's decision in Shaughnessy against Pedreiro, 349 U.S.48.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.958" offset="10315212">Judicial review is not precluded in exclusion cases by the express or the implied language of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.242" offset="10360351">The Administrative Procedure Act, the APA on the other hand requires a specific exemption, an express exemption in order to preclude a judicial review and such express exemption is entirely lacking here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.949" offset="10443212">The provisions for administrative finality of exclusion and deportation proceedings utilize the same language and they should be given the same meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.847" offset="10502771">The pertinent considerations of statutory language and legislative history and practical considerations support the view that the lower court decision should not be disturbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.417" offset="10561076">We also contend that in this case, a status question is presented namely whether Tom We Shung is the son of an American citizen, veteran of the Second World War.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.042" offset="10619591">And as such status question, it is reviewable under this Court's decisions in Heikkila against Barbers, 345 U.S.229, as a true status question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.318" offset="10684688">I would like to come immediately to the heart of the problem and state that in Pedreiro, the Court has decided that the words, the Attorney General's decision is final apply to administrative finality and that it was reviewable, a deportation order was reviewable in a declaratory judgment action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.761" offset="10790431">If you will look at Section 236 (c) which deals with exclusion decisions, you will find that the special inquiry officers' order is final except if it's reverse by the -- on appeal to the Attorney General which meant that administratively speaking, the Attorney General's order was final.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.666" offset="10898056">As a matter of fact in another part of the section, 236 (b), it does refer to the final order of exclusion of the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.669" offset="10946017">The Administrative Procedures Act which was enacted in 1946 followed a period of about 30 -- 30 years, the 1917 Basic Immigration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.359" offset="11000769">And during these 30 years, the number of administrative agencies of the Government as our Government's business became more complicated and more complex has increased tremendously a millions of persons in the United States both citizens and aliens had to do business with these administrative agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.792" offset="11086555">And Congress sort of handed down a new Magna Carta to the people in the United States assuring them fair proceedings before these administrative agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.316" offset="11136606">And also safeguarding the people against erroneous decisions of these administrative agencies and assuring them that there will be adequate judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.933" offset="11199091">Section 10 of the APA very clearly states that except where the statute forbid such judicial review over agency action is relegated to agency discretion that a person who feels that he has been aggrieved or wronged by an agency action has the right to seek a judicial review and it says that this -- the forms of this judicial review maybe declaratory judgment action, maybe an injunction action for mandatory injunction or other or a habeas corpus proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.369" offset="11360841">Section 12 of the APA says that any subsequent legislation in order to exempt from Section 10 of the APA, the statute or the agency must expressly do so such expressed preclusion of judicial review of the forms described in Section 10 is not present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.163" offset="11500022">In Pedreiro against Shaughnessy, Mr. Justice Black pointed to the practical difficulties of submitting an alien even the deportation case and it can be taken in an exclusion case to habeas corpus proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.722" offset="11574209">And -- and the Court stated in that case, if I may quote, and it would certainly be in keeping -- not be in keeping with either of these Acts, the APA or the 1952 Act to require a person or the deported or I may substitute order of exclusion to go to jail in order to obtain a review by a court because the practical situation here is that respondent, We Shung Tom, has been in the United States for nine years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.816" offset="11734601">Out of those nine years, he spent 10 years -- 10 months in detention and for eight years and about three months, he has lived with his father in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.591" offset="11781726">And for him to submit now to habeas corpus proceeding would mean according to the Government's brief that he must go to the port of entry in San Francisco, surrender to the Government, go to jail and then take his chances as to whether he can obtain habeas corpus proceeding before the Government deports him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.697" offset="11882141">And there are cases on the books where the Government deported persons before they were able to petition for habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.823" offset="11910666">And then if he is -- successfully in the habeas corpus proceeding then he would have to recross the United States and come back to his father to the East Coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.269" offset="11956433">It would also mean in this case and in similar cases that he would have to hire new counsel on the West Coast who would have to get familiarize himself with the facts of this case and -- and it would mean additional cost to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.996" offset="12055385">I would like to address myself to Mr. Davis' argument that the legislative history of this Act, the 1952 Act supports his contention that this Court must look for something in the statute that is not there, namely that Congress intended that in exclusion cases only habeas corpus proceeding should be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.841" offset="12190699">We deny that the legislative background of a statute should be controlling as against the express language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.042" offset="12251512">We contend that if the words have been interpreted by the Courts to mean one thing, in one section they have to mean the same thing in another section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.921" offset="12307101">And in this connection, I would like to point out that in the Pedreiro case, this Court has defined final as meaning administratively final and it meant that judicial finality has not as yet come about and that actions under Section 10 of the Act can be maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.382" offset="12396857">Now then, if the Court will look at a prior interpretation of such a problem, you will find it in Pampanga Sugar Mills against Trinidad where two sections of the Philippines Administrative Code were considered and the petitioner there claimed that merchant in one section meant something else than merchant in another section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.634" offset="12513886">And the Court held that the meaning of the word in one section will be given the same meaning in another section, unless there has been another definition put on it by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.375" offset="12588910">I would like to call your attention also to the fact that this 1952 Act begins with Section 101 which is a section dealing with definitions of words and phrases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.871" offset="12630810">And that on certain words that appear in the statute, the Act states for instance that a child means something else in -- under Title 1 and Title 2 of the Act as it means in Title 3 but it does not say so about the word final.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.624" offset="12705834">I also wish to call to the Court's attention that the legislative history is not in all favorable to the Governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.848" offset="12770722">For instance that very report that Mr. Davis referred to of the conference at the end of -- of various amendments and when the final Bill was shaped stated as follows.</text>

            <text syncTime="3223.693" offset="12998196">Having -- this is -- it begins on Page 33, the end of the page and goes over to Page 34 and it says having extensively considered the problem of judicial review, the (Inaudible) are satisfied that procedures provided in the Bill adapted to the necessities of national security and the protection of economic and social welfare of the citizens of this country remain within the framework and the pattern of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.334" offset="13132675">The same court of judicial procedure is afforded the alien in both exclusion and the deportation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.106" offset="13167783">They have referred to the Administrative Procedure Act and so did the sponsors of this Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.231" offset="13192338">Senators McCarran and Walter when amendments were presented, when their -- their Bills were attacked, stated on several occasions that the Administrative Procedure Act remains.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.112" offset="13243852">As a matter of fact, the same Congressman and Senator were the sponsors of this Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.455" offset="13277184">And Mr. Walter spoke very affectionately about the APA and he said, “You will remember the Walter-Logan Act which became the Administrative Procedure Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.600" offset="13321801">And he says it is very close to my heart that people should have the right of judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.429" offset="13377076">The petitioner has given several sections of the law where exemption from this rule of judicial review is accomplished by the 1952 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.383" offset="13428903">I only have to quote the old maxim that the exception strengthens the rule and that is absolutely so here and very clearly illustrated where Congress wanted to relegate or limit the judicial review to habeas corpus proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.968" offset="13499225">They did so in express language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.032" offset="13511450">For instance, they did it in Sections 242 (a) and (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.030" offset="13531512">Both these sections refer to the testing of the reasonableness or the detention of the bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.579" offset="13569651">However, you will note that this was very logical because habeas corpus is germane to determining the reasonableness of detention and -- and the release on bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.458" offset="13625240">Again, in Section 360, Section 360 has a history in the 1940 Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.507" offset="13665364">The 1940 Nationality Act contained the provision Section 503 of that Act which said the persons who claim American citizenship and who are refused a visa or travel documents to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.252" offset="13732342">I -- I have to correct that visa.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.799" offset="13738611">It doesn't apply to one who claims American citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.000" offset="13755329">Travel documents, United States passports, (Inaudible) declaratory judgment action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.607" offset="13777795">This provision after an experience with it for a while showed that it lead to all kinds of abuse that persons, spurious citizens who really were not citizens of the United States obtain certificates of identities in order to prosecute such declaratory action suits in the United States and then came here and if they lost, well they may have remained in the United States further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.099" offset="13903809">And it was because of this reason, this very specific reason that Section 360 (c) was based in the Act and it does not apply to all American citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.894" offset="13950934">It is not right to say that American citizens have less right than alien's have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.857" offset="13974758">That is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.953" offset="13979146">It only applies to one group of claimed alleged American citizen who obtain certificates of identities and come here then with those certificates of identities and are told when the certificates of identities are issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.136" offset="14047901">Your admission to the United States will depend on whether you are admitted at the port of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.865" offset="14082800">And these persons are not release but are kept in custody until the decision is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.481" offset="14117282">And then if they're not satisfied with the ruling of the Attorney General then they have this one review here in habeas corpus proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.049" offset="14159600">This respondent here came here as an admitted alien and he said, “Admit me to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.866" offset="14198888">I am the son of a naturalized American citizen who served in World War II and I'm admissible under this Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.648" offset="14233997">Of course there are all kinds of difficulties which appeared in some of these Chinese cases where there are no the proof of relationship because they know nothing about making records in China or haven't in the past and I don't think that they do it either at the present time and then these difficulties of identification arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.289" offset="14324485">That is the problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.203" offset="14332217">Now, this man has been out for eight long years and he would like to finally get a determination as to whether he can stay here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.098" offset="14379760">The Court can draw on his determined and dogged fight that the Chinese cook, the father and the young Chinese waiter have fought through these great courts of the United States for eight long years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.702" offset="14450186">This must show to the Court that they -- their cause is just.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.510" offset="14473383">I would like to say yet above the question of status in the Heikkila against Barbers, Mr. Justice Clark has stated that Heikkila did not bring himself within the Henke and Kristensen cases which one dealt with the eligibility for citizenship, the other one with citizenship question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.461" offset="14589262">Heikkila was a deportation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.405" offset="14600965">It wasn't a status question and so the Court said what we contend here that this case is status question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.002" offset="14635342">It involves a true question of status namely is We Shung Tom, the son of an American citizen?</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.735" offset="14670346">Because if he is, this gives him a status.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.196" offset="14684139">This gives him a status which makes him eligible for entry to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.340" offset="14704724">And in the Heikkila and the Kristensen and the (Inaudible) rulings such status question can be determined in a declaratory judgment action and we -- we contend that this can be done here too.</text>
