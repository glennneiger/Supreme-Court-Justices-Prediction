            <text syncTime="16.206" offset="168208">The indictment in this case can be stated in a single sentence, just one sentence that the United Automobile workers used union dues to pay for television broadcasts which urged and endorsed the election of certain Senators and Congressmen in which it included expressions of political advocacy intended to influence the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.947" offset="259114">That is the entire indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.895" offset="270921">The Union asked for no bill of particulars because it read the indictment to charge no more than the use of union dues to pay for television broadcasts and to make the Union's position on federal candidates known to its members and the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.517" offset="341452">In other words, if Your Honors please, we read the indictment as charging a C.I.O. case type statement of union position over a different media of communication and we deemed the case as we thought the Government did a proper vehicle for settling the question whether a commercial telecast would be treated differently from a statement in a house organ the contents of the communication being similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.895" offset="470915">We move to dismiss on the ground that the indictment so interpreted did not charge in expenditure within the meaning of Section 610 and if it did was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.956" offset="515218">I believe the Solicitor General inadvertently left out the fact that we had moved on statutory construction as well as on constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.000" offset="555342">I only refer to it because it does differentiate our action in this respect to that of the defendant in the C.I.O. case some years past.</text>

            <text syncTime="178.387" offset="816880">The Solicitor General I believe conceives the indictment to be that allows him to prove in addition to what we say it is in the indictment two other things.</text>

            <text syncTime="207.166" offset="932028">In other words, they claimed the right to prove that we intended to make a contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.020" offset="955434">Now, what we say and what I believe they said in the court below and we have filed it, sir with the Clerk our briefs below too, so that they are available to the Court and the references are in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.627" offset="1017919">We contend that below the Government said to Judge Picard, “Distinguish the C.I.O. case on the ground that there's a difference between a commercial television broadcast and a house organ.”</text>
            <text syncTime="243.064" offset="1075597">They never suggested these differences of content of the statement that was to go out nor did they suggest any difference of intent over the -- to make a contribution and indeed I would point out that the indictment contains no reference to such an intent and the representative of the Government in the court below made clear that they were not charging a contribution.</text>

            <text syncTime="652.410" offset="2713057">Indeed, the Court went on to make perfectly clear they were making a decision on principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.807" offset="2734582">As we point out in our brief at page 36, the Court said that any distinction between the C.I.O. case and an independent newspaper or radio station and I quote from Judge Hand's opinion, “It seems without logical justification nor such a differentiation suggested by the apparent purposes or by the terms of the statute or by the legislative history.” Now, the Government accepted this for six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.564" offset="2853595">For six years after the C.I.O. and Painters Local case, there were no indictments for following the Painters Local case.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.373" offset="2896854">And if I may call Your Honors' attention to the fact that last May, the Assistant Attorney General and whose jurisdiction of this case falls and months before this indictment was brought told a committee investigating this problem, they, the Supreme Court expressed so many doubts about it referring to the statute, all of them did, that it made it about impossible certainly impractical to prosecute under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.885" offset="3030915">In other words, for six years it was government policy to interpret the Painters Local case exactly as we interpret it today.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.322" offset="3072711">For six years, it was government policy to treat the C.I.O. case as applicable to statements over in the newspapers, purchase statements and the purchase statements in radios.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.052" offset="3127568">And it is only today, sometime later that the Government has changed its interpretation of the C.I.O. case and of the Painters Local case.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.936" offset="3179081">I would suggest if Your Honors please that on page 6 of the Government's reply brief, there is a suggestion that they did not prosecute during this period because there was a wide area where unions may and do operate without contravening the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.499" offset="3261419">This statement appears at the end -- towards the end of Footnote 3 of the Government's reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.168" offset="3292035">This in answer to our contention that for six years we have been allowed this latitude of the Painters Local and the Government says, “Oh no, we were only allowing you a wide area where unions may and do operate without contravening the statute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="812.657" offset="3353997">What they are saying there is that they were allowing us to spend voluntary money.That is not the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.337" offset="3388688">For six years, unions continued to rely upon Painters Local and only now for reasons not disclosed was there a change in governmental policy to take Painters Local out of the situation and say that the C.I.O. case has a different meaning than the three distinguished judges in Painters Local held (Voice Overlap) --</text>

            <text syncTime="876.858" offset="3610833">And I would say that an expenditure for example take a union man, a union employee and put him in the headquarters of the -- of the candidate.</text>

            <text syncTime="915.836" offset="3766732">As this Court said not greatly to extend contribution but to give, make it clear that you can't have these indirect contributions and I say that if you -- if the Union wants to put its people to work for the candidate, that's an indirect contribution or an expenditure, facilities would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.739" offset="3846353">Now, I would go farther and say that there are borderline cases where speech might be.</text>

            <text syncTime="947.825" offset="3894627">There were borderline cases of speech which are not involved in this indictment which this Court may have to decide someday, where one could argue that it's an indirect contribution and therefore an expenditure was in the meaning here and still, speech for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.351" offset="3984802">I would say if we did nothing but put on vote for X, that might be treated as an indirect contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.352" offset="4016776">I would say if we paid for the candidate's broadcast that would be an indirect contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.043" offset="4043525">Now, whether we're part from doing that under the Constitution remains to be seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.399" offset="4060975">I only say that case is not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.727" offset="4074245">What is here is the expression of views of the type of the C.I.O. case expression of views and that this clearly is outside the statute and that there are plenty of things left to give meaning to the word expenditures even things which are within the realm of speech where this Court may someday be faced with the problem but where it is not faced today.</text>

            <text syncTime="1855.709" offset="7526170">I agree on reflection that there are two motives that we share in stating our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.580" offset="7565667">There are -- it's the motive of wanting to win the election and there is the motive of wanting to state your position, but I say it is relevant that there is the motive of -- of stating your position, which maybe protected by the Constitution more likely than the motive of handing over money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.715" offset="7650200">Therefore, having the two motives is not a negative practice such as was suggested yesterday but a positive factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.566" offset="7681651">And in conclusion on this point only, I would like to make this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.523" offset="7701504">Before leaving the question of statutory construction, I should like to advert to the contention of the Solicitor General and particularly to his answers to Mr. Justice Reed and Mr. Justice Harlan that the appropriate action of this Court would be the hold of the indictment charged in offense within the meaning of the word expenditure and then return the case to the District Court for a trial to decide whether such a limitation was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.240" offset="7804322">But that's the opposite of years of history of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.790" offset="7818533">It would mean separating the question of statutory construction from the question of constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.544" offset="7845595">Those must be decided together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.786" offset="7854477">Suppose the Government had come here in C.I.O. and said, “Treat this as expenditure and let it go back to the District Court to decide whether it's constitutional.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.170" offset="7896064">Then, the very reason that this Court gave for its interpretation would not have been considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.973" offset="7923231">You cannot, if Your Honors please, separate the constitutional question from the question of statutory interpretation because in this field more than any other one, the question of statutory interpretation depends in large measure through the doctrine of constitutional doubts upon the question of interpretation and that they are interrelated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.398" offset="8028975">Now, therefore, if this indictment is precise enough, it's clear enough so that you can make a decision on statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.245" offset="8080384">The Court will be faced with the constitutional decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.498" offset="8093341">Now, we say it is clear enough if interpreted to charge no more than a C.I.O. type advocacy over a commercial television station, and if it charges that and no more then this Court by avoiding the great constitutional doubts involved, if we as a union are prevented access to the media of communication should interpret the word expenditures as excluding that indictment as interpreted by the District Court and affirming, but the one point it seems to me is clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.916" offset="8243075">In the distinguished argument that was made yesterday was the suggestion that you decide the interpretative issue and let the constitutional one go back for trial because you would then be deciding one-half of a coin that cannot be split apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.495" offset="8313396">And now, turning if Your Honors please to the -- in the remaining time, to the question of constitutional --</text>

            <text syncTime="2223.611" offset="8997804">Our union expands its funds in this area for political broadcast out of a thing called The Citizenship Fund.</text>

            <text syncTime="2245.870" offset="9086830">In other words, while the Government defends this statute on the ground that it was intended to protect minorities, it is not a protection of minorities because you could have done that much simpler.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.249" offset="9136358">Why didn't they say, “Let some -- let the minorities if they want to have the right contract out of the fund” or why didn't they say “it's all right if there isn't any minority.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.430" offset="9181080">Senator Taft made clear what they were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.264" offset="9192469">Senator Taft said, “The purpose of this Bill is to take labor out of politics.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.732" offset="9210337">And the Solicitor General yesterday with commendable candor said, “The purpose of the Bill was to minimize the influenceable of labor at the time of an election.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.401" offset="9248998">That was the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.563" offset="9253595">There was no purpose of protecting the minority because the statute isn't aimed at the minority problem,” and in the area of free speech where this Court has so many times made clear that the -- that the limitation on speech must be as narrow as the evil presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.674" offset="9326111">If they were going to deal with the minority problem, it was absolutely essential that they limit the matter to the minority problem as that to say, “Unions, you're out of political action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.532" offset="9369475">And as we say in our brief and we have made a great deal of -- of this point, this statute was not aimed at minorities because they were unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.094" offset="9407718">We can't act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.088" offset="9411688">If we have a contracting out scheme, we can't act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.788" offset="9422555">If every member of our union wants to go further to this, we cannot act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.812" offset="9438647">So, that's what I meant, sir, when I said that this does not deal with the minority problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.265" offset="9460381">Now, what we have here is a denial of access to the public of the collective use of union members, denial of access to press, television, radio, magazines, public rallies, letter writing campaigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.606" offset="9517746">What this statute does is to put in the hands of the opponents of labor the right to decide whether the voice of labor maybe heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.387" offset="9556929">If we want to put our position out, the decision then whether it shall be heard if the statute is valid becomes a decision of Hearst, Howard and (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.204" offset="9604159">They control whether we get heard, but if can buy the time then we decide whether we could be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.232" offset="9636342">This statute as I say denies union's access to the media of communication except at the will of the opponents of labor, and it's a denial of free speech at the very heart of the democratic process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.643" offset="9697991">The great decisions of this Court in Stromberg and in Near, the great dissent in Whitney are based on the proposition that free government by free men depends upon all discussion of the great issues of political life.</text>

            <text syncTime="2426.595" offset="9809795">Now, this Court's protections of the First Amendment have gone far beyond what we are asking, not only has a presumption of constitutionality been reversed, but lesser restriction such as taxes, licenses, regulations on extremer sects have been knocked out by this Court without reference to the degree of -- of influence of the ideas involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.981" offset="9919300">What we have here is not a partial restraint on noxious doctrines but a complete prohibition on politically significant speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.797" offset="9958588">Can it be that speech, free speech is intended to protect extremer sects but not those groups where there will be actual influence on the processes of democracy?</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.801" offset="10006549">Is speech importantly only to the point of actual influence on the workings of American life?</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.622" offset="10029850">Well, I think the answer speaks for itself and if the Court please, political activity has been an integral part of trade union activity in America for the 100 years of our political activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="3762.133" offset="15151940">Well, the statute does not have that -- that kind of provision.Congress didn't see fit to attack it in that manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.360" offset="15180779">Now, the English statutes did provide that any member of the Union that did not approve the political activity could have his funds withdrawn and handled it in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.173" offset="15236054">But Congress examined it from the standpoint of probably recognizing that the Unions have a great deal of power under the Wagner Act to exercise in the manner, state pressure in getting a union shop and other requirements to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.470" offset="15313272">And therefore, and also the fact that generally there was not unanimity and the election showed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.739" offset="15342320">And therefore, it tried to handle it in this manner by keeping them out of this particular type of activity and compare it exactly with the regulation of corporations in the same field, but they have all of the activity where it can be voluntary, but they can't compel it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.298" offset="15412537">That's the real issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.301" offset="15424554">If they can get the subscriptions of the voluntary contributions from their people which they concede is difficult to do, they can use that all they want to and they have no trouble at all with the Government under this statute or any other.</text>
