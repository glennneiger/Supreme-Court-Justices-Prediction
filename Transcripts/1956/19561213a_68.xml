            <text syncTime="20.530" offset="185448">This is a disbarment suit brought in the federal court in which I am, the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.138" offset="215960">I'm representing myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.950" offset="231215">The disbarment suit in the federal court was based on a judgment of disbarment in the state court in accordance with the rules for the Eastern District of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.636" offset="293909">I would like to go back just a bit so that Your Honors may have a short history of the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.606" offset="341765">I was admitted to practice in 1910 into state law and very shortly thereafter, in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.087" offset="391711">I practiced law from 1910 until 1936 quite actively.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.539" offset="429537">I also undertook the other matters in line with my professional duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.437" offset="457122">I was the editor of the Southern Law Quarterly printed by and published by Tulane University which came to an end at the beginning of the First World War.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.644" offset="509994">And subsequently, after the First World War, I became one of the editors of the Southern Law Quarterly of Tulane which is going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.746" offset="546356">I taught at Tulane University in the law school, part time as a gracious act contribution of love for a profession which I cherish without salary of course, for 16 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.925" offset="619081">In 1935, I realized myself that my health was impaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.910" offset="655026">I found it almost impossible to go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.835" offset="666728">I have been very active, trial work over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.027" offset="683447">I had tried many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.869" offset="690866">I couldn't begin to give you an idea of how many.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.884" offset="706957">And I had to give up the law school.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.012" offset="731408">I felt that I couldn't go on, although it was one of the great things in my life.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.908" offset="758993">In the summer of 1936, I collapsed.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.225" offset="784280">There was trouble in my business.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.689" offset="790131">There was trouble in my affairs, and I was moved by my family and my friends to a mental institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.098" offset="839764">It is a fact that I remained there as patient for more than 10 years, seven years in De Paul Sanitarium, seven months in the state institution for mentally afflicted at Jackson, Louisiana and about three years in the parish infirmary in the City of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.398" offset="960972">I received fine care, good treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.757" offset="974451">I was taken cared of.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.843" offset="986781">I myself reached the point gradually where I've realized that I must get well and I wanted to get well and that I mustn't hurry my cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.323" offset="1064626">I reached the point where some charges which had been made against me, there were two charges that were made against me of mishandling of funds, and one of those charges involving a large sum of money, $42,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.035" offset="1143515">The District Attorney and the Attorney General on the recommendation of a coroner and a committee reached the conclusion that I was well enough to be tried criminally for this embezzlement or alleged embezzlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.969" offset="1219271">By that time, I was well enough to take care of myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.316" offset="1236616">By that time, I was well enough to go through my records such as they were and particularly through my checks and to assist the gentlemen, my friends who had finally consented to represent me in that criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.476" offset="1317282">And the case was tried on this charge of an embezzlement of $42,000, tried to seven or eight days before a jury in the criminal court in the parish of Orleans where the result with the evidence that I was able to offer, but I was acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.293" offset="1388544">The result being that I was not guilty, I hadn't taken the woman's money.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.572" offset="1413622">Instead of having embezzled $42,000, she owed me $5,000 in round figures plus the interest that I had paid her on the money for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.792" offset="1466493">I had repaid the principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.889" offset="1474957">Immediately, the criminal authorities undertook to bring up the second suit which they had allowed to remain dormant for these 10 years and l pleaded prescription under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.972" offset="1535248">And that went to the Supreme Court on the appeal of the Attorney General, it was a great feeling in my case for some reason or other.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.315" offset="1584671">And the Supreme Court of Louisiana held that my plea of limitations was well founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.275" offset="1628453">In that decision, which was rendered in 1948 -- remember, I had already have been sick and whatnot since 1936, even since 1935 when I left the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.545" offset="1689579">That decision became quite important as I appreciate it because it's all mentioned in the brief because there was the question of prescription or the statute of limitations in the argument that we made that the prescription was well founded in the counter argument made by the authorities that they haven't been able to prosecute me because of my illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.378" offset="1804936">And then, this important question to me came up whether because of the way in which the time had divided itself between what I call free time when I might have been prosecuted and close time when I was under a decree and couldn't be prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.069" offset="1887692">Whether that fact had interrupted the prescription, destroyed where it had gone before, so that it will have to start all over again, or whether it had merely suspended the prescription during the period of enforced inaction on the part of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.623" offset="1953834">And the Supreme Court in the unanimous case on this plea of prescription held, "The question was new and had never heard of or raised by anybody."</text>
            <text syncTime="475.952" offset="2007228">They could find no case in point and they had to decide it as they said, at 212 Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.083" offset="2039724">According to their sense of justice, and they decided in so many words that since the inability to prosecute me in that criminal action then 11 or 12 years old, had not been due to any act on my part to nothing willful, to know misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.552" offset="2145573">But since on the contrary and these are the words of the Court, “If the act, a situation was neither deliberate nor intentional,” and again, using the words of the Court, “that resulted from a condition which I could not prevent,” or as the Court said exactly over which I had no control, that they would hold that the prescription had been suspended and not interrupted.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.669" offset="2266049">Of course, that was the end of that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.087" offset="2287679">Now, there had been only two cases against me that I've just told Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.831" offset="2306696">This first case which I won before the jury and this other case which they had been holding back for 10 years in a hope of being able to use it, if they could.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.771" offset="2354448">I have never been convicted of any felony or other offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.191" offset="2392168">My mental condition required this hospitalization for 10 years, running into from roughly a little over 10 years, running from 1936 to 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.577" offset="2449638">In 1948, I was quite well.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.560" offset="2457579">I knew I was well.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.963" offset="2463222">I think everybody else in the City of New Orleans knew that I was well, although I had been always institutionalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.914" offset="2491016">I was never out of an institution from 1936 to 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.578" offset="2521736">Shortly thereafter, the committee proceeding which had been held against me which we call interdiction in Louisiana was lifted at a regular contested hearing of the probate court which -- with our civil district court which handles those matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.130" offset="2599894">And in 1948, no charges against me whatever, being perfectly well having gone through 10 years of care and treatment and having been completely restored to health, I undertook to begin again the practice of civil law.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.843" offset="2710758">I must say that my friends and my clients knew that I had what I may call a tough time.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.085" offset="2751718">Well, they're pleased, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.021" offset="2763421">Old clients flocked to me and for six years without a word of complaint -- or for four years without a word of complaint from the Bar Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.946" offset="2815143">And for six years concurrently with no objection from anyone, any lawyer, any opponent, any member of the public, I undertook again the practice of law which had been stopped by my illness in 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.284" offset="2892466">I was very successful, very active as I had always been.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.715" offset="2918275">And from 1948 to 1954, during those six years that I was permitted to resume practice and that I actually resumed practice, it is a fact and I -- that's in the record, that I tried 37 cases in the appellate courts of the state, real cases, contested cases and -- but they've seen themselves on an act which during my illness, I had committed on -- as they say, I have no recollection of it, on the 2nd of January 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.456" offset="3097161">In June 1952, the Bar Association, which is a prosecuting unit for disbarment in Louisiana, brought a disbarment suit against me, nothing having made in examination, preliminary examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.521" offset="3177409">I went on practicing law because as I tell you, the period of my activity was from 1936 to 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.790" offset="3210533">It only stopped when there was a final decree of disbarment against me in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.980" offset="3239267">During which time as I say, I've tried 37 hardly contested cases which are all in the books and which I have tried alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.210" offset="3276257">I have had associates, but I'm not in the habit of shaking work or turning it over to other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.899" offset="3310947">I like to do things myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.635" offset="3317948">I never had direct other partners at any time in my career which as I say started in 1910.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.666" offset="3353997">This proceeding for disbarment as I say based on an act which was said to have been committed in 1935 was tried in the way in which we try it.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.064" offset="3407600">Under our -- under the Constitution of the State of Louisiana, the exclusive jurisdiction and I must say -- ask you to let me emphasize that.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.063" offset="3451591">The exclusive jurisdiction for disbarment is vested by the Constitution, not by any statute in the original jurisdiction of our Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.538" offset="3505507">The Supreme Court doesn't actually try disbarment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.290" offset="3524524">It takes a complaint from a bar committee, we have an Integrated Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.984" offset="3559320">And of course, the defendant has afforded every opportunity to defend himself, and if I claim that there has been a warrant of due process in my case, let me make clear at once that I'm not complaining of any lack of procedure of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.435" offset="3633089">I've got plenty opportunity to defend myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.991" offset="3647300">What I claim is a lack of substantive due process for the reasons which I would just -- would mention in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.707" offset="3678229">I -- the -- in accordance with the rules applying in that case, the matter was referred to a Commissioner and the testimony was taken before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.265" offset="3732459">All I could testify to was that I had signed the documents that they showed me.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.549" offset="3765582">I admitted that they were my signature.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.568" offset="3773628">I couldn't remember why or under what circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.420" offset="3789093">Remember, this was already 18 years since 1935, but then it come into period of my illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.305" offset="3816573">In the same period of time referred to by the Supreme Court and holding in the case in the 212, that they must take into consideration the fact that whatever I had done was not deliberate or intentional but the result of what they call a -- a condition over which I had no control.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.915" offset="3911032">The Commissioner or the Bar Association was quite vehement.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.182" offset="3936110">They've always been very aggressive in my case and they protested that this was a criminal act and they continued to protest and have always protested.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.976" offset="3991280">They've had to protest because they lost the suit as I appreciate it in this -- although I was disbarred by the state court, they lost the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.413" offset="4025031">The report of the Commissioner was that unquestionably, I was suffering from some kind of insanity or lack of mental control.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.751" offset="4074350">And then under our practice, exceptions were filed to the report of the Commissioner and the matter was argued on these exceptions before the Supreme Court of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.390" offset="4136939">The Supreme Court of the State held that -- apparently, that my insanity had been proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.979" offset="4183333">They put it in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.229" offset="4188244">They said, “We don't think insanity is a defense, but we will concede it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.507" offset="4213426">We will concede it for the purpose of this discussion or for the purpose of this decision,” as I say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.054" offset="4247594">And therefore, we -- we will disbar Theard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.770" offset="4278418">And then, to emphasize if it was possible to emphasize the fact that they went out finding me guilty of any criminal act, they took up the exception which had been filed to the master's report by the bar committee and they said, “The bar committee who separates that the Master made a report that Theard was guilty of a criminal act, that the way he wrote that shows that in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.148" offset="4407986">He was guilty of a criminal act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.495" offset="4417390">And we accept to the Master's report and the Supreme Court said, “Under the view that we have taken over the matter, we are conceding the insanity.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.824" offset="4466709">Under the view that we have taken here the matter, we don't have to consider this charge of criminality which I think was a loss of the case by the Committee which knew that there was something fatally wrong with the decree of disbarment based on an insane act which was conceded by the Court which decreed the disbarment, but which decreed the disbarment just the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.528" offset="4565452">Now, because it was conceded by it, I say as the basis for the disbarment excluding specifically all other claims made in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.103" offset="4619786">Now, that was particularly distressing I think and perhaps say in with respect, particularly wrong because the Constitution of Louisiana which as I have just told you, controls disbarment absolutely, and vest it with the Supreme Court also provides in so many words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.590" offset="4725739">And that's the history of a law or condition which arose through the years and goes back 60 years, that the Court is vested with jurisdiction for disbarment in cases of misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.347" offset="4804733">I say and I think anyone would agree that under that constitutional fiat, there can be no -- no disbarment in Louisiana and there should be no disbarment in Louisiana and there can be no disbarment in Louisiana except for the cause set forth, namely, misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.644" offset="4901909">The rules of the Court and the rules of the integrated bar association which has been made the rules of the Court by an order of the Court, go further and say that the lawyer shall be disbarred who is guilty, of course I couldn't say of anything in contravention of the Constitution, but they make it I think a little stronger because they say and it's all quoted in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.901" offset="5014967">That disbarment will be -- will result from the willful misconduct of an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.027" offset="5051434">Now, how does the Supreme Court could hold that I should be disbarred because -- or despite the fact that I was insane and not from any other cause where the only cause under the Constitution should have been misconduct, more than I can say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.136" offset="5131891">Now, Your Honors would say that this is not an appeal from the decree of the state court, no, but immediately after the Supreme Court had rendered this judgment in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.761" offset="5182464">I prayed for a rehearing which had been refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.925" offset="5195107">I have done everything else that I could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.217" offset="5208273">Immediately, the Bar Association notified the United States Attorney that I should be -- the proceeding should be taken against me to disbar me in the federal court and this is the proceeding that we are discussing now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.883" offset="5262921">The United States Attorney I suppose could have disbarred me for any -- any kind of act that he thought was -- which involved justification, but he chose to bring a suit for my disbarment in the federal court based exclusively on this judgment, exclusively on this judgment which said that eliminating all other causes, I should be disbarred because I was sick.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.829" offset="5386637">So, I raised several defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.897" offset="5402937">This is a proceeding that went to the Court of Appeals and that comes here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.275" offset="5448495">I raised the proceeding that of course the Court had deprived me of my property, had deprived me of my property without due process of law just as to why it raised that proceeding in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.107" offset="5503770">That no man, no matter what the basis may be for disbarment and most people agree that disbarment is not based on the idea of punishment, but it's based on the protection of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.918" offset="5559045">That no man should be sued no man -- under either basis because he was sick especially, especially when the disbarment suit was brought in the state court 17 years after the act, and in the federal court, 19 years after the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.083" offset="5659669">In two weeks, the act will be 21 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.193" offset="5676178">And in the meantime, he had regained his health, nobody questions my complete sanity and my health mentally and physically at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.217" offset="5728214">Nobody conceded and nobody questioned it then, but I have had 10 years of -- of sorrowful treatment, quiet and the kind of help to -- or the kind of care and treatment to which I think I was entitled and which brought out no matter what the case may bring.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.459" offset="5833226">A very satisfactory help so far as my personal condition was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.283" offset="5856528">So, I urge that defense, or is a complete violation of the State's statute which limits disbarment to misconduct as I have just told you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.876" offset="5902921">And I urge the long period that had ensued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.788" offset="5930506">I think that I've told Your Honors all that I can say about my complete recovery and about the cause of the disbarment which was illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.813" offset="5966660">I raised the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.856" offset="5970840">It was in the state court and in the federal court too because there, I think that the application of that doctrine was quite quoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.797" offset="6014516">I said that the long delay had changed everything in my life, made it almost impossible for me to defend myself in 19 years since the act was committed or now sued in the federal court, and that I had absolutely recovered, that I had practiced for six years without any complaint from anybody except this belated complaint from the Bar Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.265" offset="6124440">No one else, no judge has ever questioned my right to appear before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.786" offset="6142516">I appeared before the Supreme Court during that period any number of times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.216" offset="6164250">I can't tell you because I haven't really undertaken to find out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.625" offset="6185880">I can't tell you how many of these 37 cases were cases in the Orleans Court of Appeal or in the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.361" offset="6220779">I dare say that the majority was in the Orleans Court of Appeal, but there were questions of great importance which I tried before the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.874" offset="6262888">I was the first person who ever succeeded in getting a Louisiana -- in getting a judgment in Louisiana against the Coca Cola Company in the Supreme Court or in where else if I know in state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.737" offset="6318268">I won a lot of tax cases and land cases which I tried some succession matters which -- land matters which have been a specialty of mine during my many years of practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.068" offset="6371662">And I call the attention of the Court to the fact that we had in Louisiana a state -- a statute which provides a liberative prescription or a statute of liberative limitation, which provides that in any personal action for which in the language of our Civil Code, there is no enumerated prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.004" offset="6503424">No special prescription that the prescription of 10 years will apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.117" offset="6523800">Now, there was a -- and this was brought in the state court 17 years after the act of 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.316" offset="6552639">In the federal court, 19 years after the act, I think the Supreme Court of Louisiana -- and I told the federal court because the Solicitor General has said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.282" offset="6604466">He said a number of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.520" offset="6621497">He says for example that the federal court is bound by the description of the -- or the interpretation of the statute by the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.051" offset="6675623">And I answer that it must be a -- an interpretation that doesn't do violence to language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.025" offset="6711463">You can't say that any court under the direction to disbar only for misconduct can interpret overturn -- upset the statute by saying that that means that the -- the subject can be disbarred for illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.527" offset="6809475">Nobody can say that -- that illness is misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.841" offset="6838732">And of course, in a question in which a man's property and right to practice has been taken from him which is a right of property, I'm not going to argue that to Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.862" offset="6878856">It's been many times decided by you and that no frail or incorrect interpretation of the statute by the state court is binding on this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.678" offset="6954088">When you grant certiorari, the case is yours and you don't shed your power by undertaking to look into the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.775" offset="7002467">Now, may I say before I sit down and perhaps I can have a few more minutes for rebuttal, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.856" offset="7030784">May I say that the Court of Appeals who took this case, the District Judge listened to a short argument, decided that I should be disbarred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.214" offset="7084178">They filed no brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.136" offset="7087940">It didn't seem to be an insensitive file of brief there, but we took an appeal to the Court of Appeal and we argued the very same points that we are arguing here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3255.032" offset="13123480">And that as result, the Louisiana Courts found and the law is unquestioned that the Bar Association could not file its proceedings of discipline during that whole period from -- from 1936 to 1948.</text>

            <text syncTime="3284.398" offset="13240926">In 1950 -- in 1950, some two years after the civil interdiction, judgment was -- was lifted, the Bar Association Grievance Committee served notice on petitioner in 1950 that it was undertaking to investigate 11 acts of misconduct in connection with his practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.014" offset="13335385">From 1950 to 1952, there was a series of informal conferences and so on in connection with that investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.744" offset="13378330">In 1952 -- in 1952, on June 6th and June 7th, by stipulation, the first specification only was the basis upon which the Bar Association proceeded to inquire into the misconduct of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.134" offset="13447920">And in 1952, at that hearing, it was stipulated that the question would turn on whether -- on -- in 1935, he had forged the signatures of two clients to a note for $20,000 then draft it to make it look like a mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.886" offset="13510928">In following that, sold it and misappropriated the proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.493" offset="13529318">As to that, as petitioner indicated in his opening, he admitted that but claimed that he was of unsound mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.770" offset="13558471">Following that, there was an exception to the petition being filed in the Supreme Court, a hearing at that time in 1953 following that a remand of the Commissioner back to the Supreme Court of Louisiana again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.761" offset="13610402">And in 1954, Mr. Justice Harlan, at that time, the Supreme Court entered its order disbarring the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.695" offset="13638196">So that there was no undue delay, in fact, in -- in terms of -- of the basis for the disbarment as well as the proscriptions of the Supreme Court in its opinion, had indicated that it adhered exclusively to its reading of Louisiana law which in the absence of any constitutional objection, or conflict with the federal statute I believe this Court is prepared to adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.274" offset="13716459">And for the reasons I have outlined in the earlier aspect of my argument, I feel that the decision and judgment of the District Court in adopting the same standard as the standard of the State in which it sits, not only did not violate any constitutional right of the petitioner, but it was a reasonable exercise of discretion in order to maintain the integrity of the Court, protect the courts as instruments of justice and also to carry out the responsibilities of maintaining the public confidence and trust in our profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.463" offset="13853236">So that, regardless of the intent, regardless of the motivation of the lawyer, he who concedes embezzling funds should not be continued in a place of trust and fiduciary relationship where he can advise clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.458" offset="13901197">And for that reason as we view the record, the decision of the court below should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3640.169" offset="14664077">The evidence proves that he was insane.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.873" offset="14670869">There was no evidence offered by the Committee on the question of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.177" offset="14684035">I offered my witnesses, my two doctors, and so on, but they offered no evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.440" offset="14709112">They apparently thought that because a man while insane had signed a document.Therefore, he was a criminal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3661.351" offset="14748818">And therefore, when the case came up before the state court, what I think they held and what I believe is a fair statement from reading their opinion is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.444" offset="14793122">We concede for this discussion.And now, that's a finding, a concession is a finding.</text>

            <text syncTime="3688.538" offset="14857488">And we don't care Mr. Bar Association to listen to your exception saying that he was not insane but that he is a criminal and he ought to be disbarred for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.083" offset="14895731">We refuse to pass on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.405" offset="14905031">However, it's what they've said in view of the conclusion reached and hear and above declared.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.707" offset="14934183">We need not determine the Committee's exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.872" offset="14946826">Now, that was brought to the federal court by the United States Attorney and that's all that was brought to the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.950" offset="14983189">And of course, if the state judgment -- and I was ordered under their practice because there are 83 -- I think there are 83 District Courts in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.149" offset="15028015">And only a certain number have one form of action and the others have another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.458" offset="15045256">Now, in the Eastern District of Louisiana, the fact that a judgment has been rendered for disbarment in the state court is by no means binding in the federal court for the Eastern District.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.754" offset="15102412">That's why they ordered me to come into court to present what I had to say and what I believe with reference to that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.987" offset="15143372">If it had been otherwise, why the -- the disbarment in the federal court would have been automatic and unfortunately, I could not be here.</text>
