            <text syncTime="20.690" offset="186180">The petitioner, the secretary-treasurer of a Local of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters was adjudged guilty of contempt of court by District Judge Noonan of the District Court for the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.008" offset="243440">The contempt arose out of petitioner's failure to obey a direction of District Judge Noonan to answer certain select questions as to the whereabouts of the books and records of the local union in a grand jury investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.527" offset="305507">Petitioner's refusal is based upon the ground of self-incrimination and his privilege to remain silent under the provisions of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.363" offset="340825">The petitioner's conduct was treated as a contempt committed in the actual presence of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.800" offset="366529">And the petitioner was punished summarily and sentenced to six months imprisonment under Rule 42 -- 42 (a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.797" offset="410520">The petitioner was given the right to purge himself of the contempt by appearing before the grand jury and answering the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.950" offset="451166">The District Court held that the petitioner did not sustain the burden of establishing that the answers to the selected questions would incriminate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.789" offset="498500">The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the order of District Judge Noonan and this Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.917" offset="527026">The questions involved upon this appeal are, first, whether it was evident from the implications of the questions and the setting in which they were asked that responsive answers to the questions or an explanation as to why they cannot be answered would be dangerous because injurious disclosure would result.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.064" offset="615633">And the second question relates to the procedure for -- in the hearing before District Judge Noonan.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.736" offset="646353">The petitioner made several request for an opportunity to prepare a defense and produce witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.267" offset="676446">He made several request for a complete transcript of the grand jury testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="184.704" offset="842167">So the Government upon this appeal takes a position different from the District Court and contrary to the opinion of the Court Of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.109" offset="891800">So in view of this very commendable concession, the issue presented now is a very narrow and legal one.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.528" offset="929520">And that is whether the custodian of the records of a union may refuse on the ground of his personal privilege to answer questions as to the whereabouts of the union books which have not been produced pursuant to the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.186" offset="992110">As I stated, this was not the ground upon which the petitioner was adjudged guilty of contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.356" offset="1016769">He was found guilty on the ground that he did not sustain the burden of establishing that the answers to the question would incriminate him.</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel Mezansky</label>
            <text syncTime="486.594" offset="2049755">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.123" offset="2051845">That's one of the points we urge.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.295" offset="2064593">Now, I might point out at the very beginning in view of the fact that the setting becomes important in these types of case that this petitioner was secretary-treasurer of Local 269 and he was served with two subpoenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.645" offset="2130004">He was served with a personal subpoena and a subpoena duces tecum.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.758" offset="2150379">And in each subpoena, he was directed to appear and testify as to alleged violations of the federal conspiracy statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.063" offset="2191653">Now, those subpoenas appear on pages 47 and 48 of the record and that fact will become significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.557" offset="2233553">Now, what was the general setting?</text>
            <text syncTime="536.692" offset="2250167">This petitioner was served with these subpoenas on April 9th for his appearance on April 10th.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.245" offset="2280364">About a week and a half before that date, a grand jury was impaneled in New York to investigate allegations of racketeering in the garment and trucking industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.758" offset="2326444">This investigation followed widespread public charges that seven local unions were recently chartered by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters to gain control of the Teamsters Joint Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.162" offset="2380048">It was charged that these seven locals were under the control of labor racketeers and gangsters and particularly one, Johnny DioGuardia.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.298" offset="2420590">One Martin T. Lacey was then president of the Teamsters Joint Council had commenced a civil action to declare a certain election null and void.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.834" offset="2454758">And in that civil action, Mr. Lacey had made this allegation of fraud.Judge Noonan, who found this petitioner guilty of contempt, had issued a temporary injunction in that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.047" offset="2507525">The newspapers carry stories about the fact that Mr. Lacey conferred with one of the Assistant United States Attorneys who had questioned the petitioner before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.857" offset="2546813">And these charges were dramatized in the local press, so that the setting was such that the petitioner would reasonably have feared that the -- and only was he -- to be fairly investigated but that he was to be prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.811" offset="2606582">Now, as we all know in a war, an army starts an attack with an artillery barrage and when such a thing happens, the opposing army knows that it was about to be attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.635" offset="2641899">Well, with this barrage of publicity, a lot of it consisting of press releases from the United States Attorney's office, this petitioner could reasonably have sensed the peril of prosecution for a wide variety of offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.534" offset="2701458">So when petitioner first appeared before the grand jury on April 10 and his lawyers were then in Albany, he refused to answer most of the questions saying, as appears on page 65 of the record, “You are throwing legal stuff at me and I don't know whether you are trapping me or not.”</text>
            <text syncTime="667.760" offset="2774392">He was told to come back on April 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.651" offset="2789961">He came back and his attorneys remained in the anteroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.213" offset="2808247">He denied that he had possession of the books and records at the time he was served with these subpoenas or that he had possession for at least three days prior to the date he was served with these subpoenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.040" offset="2863522">And then at page 83 of the record, incidentally, the complete transcript of the grand jury testimony appeared in the record before the Circuit Court of Appeals but was not before the District Court, it was made part of the record by consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.604" offset="2921827">We didn't have a complete transcript of the grand jury testimony until after the petitioner was adjudged guilty of contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.704" offset="2950144">And we -- we wanted part of the record, so to show the connection between the -- the questions as to the whereabouts of the books and other questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.968" offset="2979192">We're beginning at page 83.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.275" offset="2988492">We have a series of questions such as these, “Did you try and get in touch with Johnny DioGuardia, who was that well-known a racketeer after he was served with subpoenas?</text>
            <text syncTime="731.435" offset="3029138">Did you talk to him?</text>
            <text syncTime="733.069" offset="3035617">Did he order you not to produce the books and records?</text>
            <text syncTime="736.208" offset="3048155">Do you know John O'Rourke?</text>
            <text syncTime="738.220" offset="3056201">When did he last see the records?”</text>
            <text syncTime="740.610" offset="3065814">Then, the Government began a series of questions as to where the records were on certain dates.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.137" offset="3091937">And the petitioner sensing he was being tracked, said as follows at page 85, “They are leading up to something and I do not know what to do.”</text>
            <text syncTime="759.508" offset="3141360">And the Assistant United States Attorney again reframed the questions and asked the petitioner where the -- where the books were on various days for about two weeks prior to the time he was served with a subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.555" offset="3189635">And the witness refused to answer those questions on the ground of his right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.371" offset="3216906">And he was asked other questions about this local union who this stationary was that permit the stationary.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.392" offset="3240939">And finally, he was told to come back on April 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.050" offset="3259538">In the meantime, the total numbers of questions asked to the petitioner were about 225, most of which he refused to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.013" offset="3287437">On April 17th, the grand jury recessed and reconvened before District Judge Noonan.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.209" offset="3312201">And at that time, the Assistant United States Attorney submitted as an exhibit only 15 of the 225 questions as the basis for this contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.258" offset="3364446">And Judge Noonan asked the petitioner how answering the questions would incriminate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.497" offset="3385344">The attorney for the petitioner gave a very general explanation and referred to the charges made by Mr. Lacey in the civil litigation that was then going on upstairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.636" offset="3425886">The court's rule that the privilege was improperly exercised and direct to the witness to answer the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.569" offset="3453680">The petitioner was taken again before the grand jury and he again refused to answer the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.466" offset="3477191">He was brought back before Judge Noonan two days later and as the Assistant United States Attorney stated, for the purpose of having the contempt committed in the presence of the Court so that he could be punished summarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.592" offset="3541765">The petitioner was put on the stand and the Court picked out these 15 selected questions and the Court did not know of the nature of the other questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.714" offset="3582203">But these were the questions carved out of the 225 questions by the Assistant United States Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.166" offset="3608012">And the -- the witness again declined to answer those 15 selected questions as to the whereabouts of the books and records.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.426" offset="3645106">And the Court stated that under the decision in United States against Trock, decided by the Second Circuit, the burden was upon the petitioner to satisfy the Court that the answers to the questions would incriminate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.837" offset="3706755">Incidentally, this Trock decision was summarily reversed by this Court in the application for a petition for certiorari after this appeal was argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.102" offset="3743744">And we made a motion for rehearing on the basis of this Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.819" offset="3758686">That application was denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="922.961" offset="3795257">Now, the question arose in the proceeding before Judge Noonan, whether this proceeding was a secret proceeding in view of the fact that the grand jury was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.334" offset="3828694">And the Court remarked, “No, it's not a secret proceeding.”</text>
            <text syncTime="934.630" offset="3841860">And the Court noted that the press was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.333" offset="3856697">And then on page 34 of the record, there appears a statement by Judge Noonan, which was hardly conducive to a frank disclosure of the reasons for not answering the question, at the bottom of page 34, the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.910" offset="3918973">He is probably afraid that if he wakes up some morning with his head in the cement block at the bottom of the East River if he talks too much or at least he has to make some attempt to justify it if he should talk later and say anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.935" offset="3971114">He has got to make some showing in advance thereof that what he said was minimal and then only because the Court hit him over the head.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.017" offset="3999431">The Court -- later on, the Court said it was joking but I don't know whether the petitioner appreciated that humor in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.596" offset="4033808">The attorney for the petitioner asked for permission to furnish the explanation in private, not in the presence of the Assistant United States Attorney or the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.104" offset="4111757">That was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.564" offset="4111653">The attorney for the petitioner asked for an opportunity of furnishing an explanation with the Assistant United States Attorney being present but not in the presence of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.860" offset="4118862">There are several requests for a complete transcript of the grand jury testimony because the attorney did not know what the nature of the other questions were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.089" offset="4155747">These requests were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.099" offset="4167764">And finally, the Court summarily found the petitioner guilty of contempt and sentenced the petitioner to six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.269" offset="4204440">It was after he was found guilty that the petitioner received a complete transcript of the grand jury testimony and which was incorporated in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.544" offset="4249579">And several times during that hearing before District Judge Noonan, there were several requests for an opportunity to -- to prepare a defense and produce witnesses and those requests were denied because Judge Noonan move that under -- under Rule 42 (a), a summary proceeding, a hearing was not necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1076.235" offset="4408299">And that is used -- the United States Attorney consented provided we consent that we have the grand jury minutes as part of the record and he obtained an order of the Court permitting those records to be made part of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.947" offset="4471202">Now, to complete the picture, I should mention certain facts which occurred after this Court granted certiorari because briefs have been filed by the Government and by petitioner's attorney with respect to the possible mootness of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.958" offset="4547166">Certiorari was granted on October 8, 1956 and about a month later, the Government subpoenaed the accountant and the bookkeeper for the union before the grand jury and they testified that there were certain books and records then in existence in the office of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.717" offset="4638281">The U.S. Attorney then subpoenaed the petitioner and directed him to produce those books and records which were identified by the accountant and the bookkeeper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.845" offset="4690735">These records were produced and the question arose what effect they would have upon the prior contempt proceeding and the Assistant United States Attorney made a claim that it would have no effect as far as the Government was concerned because the other contempt was one that was committed previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.662" offset="4770043">And the Government now states in the brief filed on the question of possible mootness and incidentally, the Solicitor General does not claim that this appeal was moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.748" offset="4810376">But says that now with the books in their possession, the question as to the petitioner's privilege stands in a different posture and that possibly, the petitioner could go to the lower court and ask for a modification of the sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1214.779" offset="4962513">But they say that now that they have the books, the question of the petitioner's privilege stands in a different posture and they feel that if we went before District Judge Noonan, we might obtain a modification of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.517" offset="5021445">However, in our brief filed, in respect to the question of mootness, we say that the petitioner's posture has not changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.696" offset="5050180">He stands convicted of an offense within the sentence of imprisonment of six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.909" offset="5075048">And he is reluctant at this stage to answer those particular questions on the ground of self-incrimination or to place himself at the mercy of the Court that found him in contempt to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.148" offset="5119979">And so we say that this appeal is, therefore, not moot and I believe the Government agrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.987" offset="5155297">But in frankness, these facts were submitted to the Court by separate briefs filed in December of last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.776" offset="5190510">Now, we come then to the main legal question, the Government concedes that if a -- if the petitioner had a privilege, that he made an adequate showing of possible incrimination, so that the Government is now seeking to affirm this order of punishing the petitioner for contempt on a theory, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out also, different from that on which the case was presented in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.014" offset="5311404">Now, the Solicitor General argues that a custodian of union records may not refuse on the ground of his personal privilege against self-incrimination to answer questions as to the whereabouts of the union books and records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.047" offset="5383607">The Government says that this issue is purely one of law that no hearing is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.126" offset="5419865">There is no need for any witnesses and that Rule 42 (a) therefore applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.800" offset="5458526">Now, before discussing that question -- that very narrow legal question raised by the Solicitor General, I should like to say something about this procedure under Rule 42 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.482" offset="5513279">In the District Court, the petitioner was told very plainly that under the decision in Trock -- in United States against Trock, that he had the burden of establishing that the answers to the questions would incriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.099" offset="5579734">He was not warned by the District Court that he had no personal privilege in respect to these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.495" offset="5617351">So we say that as a matter of simple due process, whether the issue is one of fact or one of law, the petitioner was entitled to some notice that that was the basis of the charge against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.915" offset="5683075">Rule 42 (a) deals with contempt committed in the actual presence of the Court and upon facts which are within the judges' personal knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.765" offset="5738454">This Court has held that under Rule 42 (a), knowledge acquired from the testimony of others even the confession of the accused would not justify conviction for contempt without a trial and without giving contemnor an opportunity to defend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.796" offset="5818598">Leading cases, the Terry case, in that case, the marshal was assaulted by a person right in the presence of the Court and there Rule 42 (a) applied and the Court saw the misbehavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.572" offset="5877635">But in this case, while it is true that the contempt consists of the petitioner's refusal to answer questions as directed by the Court, the validity of the court's order, directing the petitioner to answer the question, depends upon facts which were not within the knowledge -- personal knowledge of the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.731" offset="5966346">And we, therefore, say in the First Circuit, in Carlson against United States so held that under these circumstances, a witness is entitled to notice of the charge against him and an opportunity -- he should be given an opportunity to defend the charge and produce witnesses if he so saw fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.391" offset="6052968">He was also entitled to a complete transcript of the grand jury testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.608" offset="6073762">That was the holding in another case in the Second Circuit by a different panel of the same court, in Zwillman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.052" offset="6107617">In that case, the Court -- Judge Augustus Hand wrote that the Government was not obliged to disclose the testimony before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.227" offset="6144293">But if it chose to adopt such attitude and to confine the defendant's defense only to showing that the questions asked were incriminating on their face, you could not put him in contempt so long as it prevented him from adducing evidence that would demonstrate that his answers were likely to form links in proof of a conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.047" offset="6239587">We turn now then to the basic legal issue as to whether or not this petitioner had a personal privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.457" offset="6273233">The Government says that as secretary-treasurer of a union, he had no privilege what was bound to answer questions as to the whereabouts of the union books and records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.082" offset="6327672">As I pointed out, this witness was served with two subpoenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.548" offset="6345540">A personal subpoena and a subpoena duces tecum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.906" offset="6359019">And in each subpoena, he was directed to appear and testify and that we believe is a very significant factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.025" offset="6395486">We do not believe that this witness can be cutup into different personalities so conveniently and we do not believe that the petitioner's constitutional rights can depend upon the expert use of the scissors or the carving knife by carving out 15 questions and disregarding the other questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.093" offset="6491721">Out of an entire interrogation of 225 questions, can we carved out just 15 and say that as to these, although, the answers would incriminate the petitioner that petitioner in his capacity as custodian had no privilege?</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.664" offset="6566013">We do not believe and we submit that if the constitutional question cannot be decided in a vacuum or in an isolation booth completely unmindful or insensible to all the facts and the fact that this petitioner was a perspective defendant and he was directed to appear and testify in both of those subpoenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.964" offset="6655248">Now, that fact is significant because we take the Wilson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.135" offset="6671862">In that case, this Court held that an officer of a corporation could not refuse to produce books and records even though those books and records would incriminate the officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.109" offset="6727764">In United States against White, that same principle was applied to union books and records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.085" offset="6755662">But in the Wilson case, Chief Justice Hughes pointed out, there is no question, of course, of oral testimony or he was not required to give any.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.884" offset="6806862">In the Wilson case, it was simply a subpoena duces tecum with no direction to testify.</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel Mezansky</label>
            <text syncTime="1734.614" offset="7041860">Now, in the Wilson case, he was not required to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.920" offset="7071013">In the White case, which was the case which applied to union books and records, Mr. Justice Murphy pointed out that there was no effort or indicated intention to examine him personally as a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.615" offset="7133811">Well, those cases have no application and both of those cases were based upon the fact that a witness may not complain if records which were semipublic in character furnished the incriminating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.544" offset="7197550">And the question now presented is whether these principles in these cases may be projected to require oral testimony of an officer which concededly would be incriminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.743" offset="7266304">Now, the argument is made that if a witness of a corporation -- an officer of a corporation or an officer of a union is required to produce books and records, shouldn't he be required to answer questions auxiliary to their production?</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.903" offset="7339029">That is as to their whereabouts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.253" offset="7352404">There is a case in the Second Circuit where such -- such statement was made in the Court's opinion but that referred only to the identification of the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.834" offset="7394722">That was the Austin-Bagley case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.577" offset="7405693">In that case, the defendant was charged with a violation of the National Prohibition Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.288" offset="7428472">The United States Attorney introduced the books and records of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.653" offset="7449997">The counsel for one of the defendants, the officer, objected on the ground that the records were not identified and the United States Attorney called as a witness, the defendant officer, and asked him to identify these records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.162" offset="7516035">And the Court held that he was required to identify the records because that question was auxiliary to the production of the books and records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.684" offset="7562115">There is no decision on this precise question by this Court and the question has not appeared in any other decision and the only case directly in point on this precise question is a decision of a New York court recently rendered where it was held that an officer of a union could refuse to testify as to whereabouts of the union books and records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.321" offset="7688652">Now, the Government says that we could have obtained this information in another way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.556" offset="7721566">We could have started a proceeding to punish this petitioner for a contempt for failing to produce the books and records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.994" offset="7759391">In that proceeding, he would have been required to furnish a reasonable explanation as to the whereabouts of the books and records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.204" offset="7804217">Now, there is a decision in the Eighth Circuit, in Lopiparo against United States, decided in 1954, where the Court held, it was a 2-to-1 decision, where the Court held that in such a proceeding to punish a witness for a contempt for failing to produce corporation books and records, the witness was required to furnish an explanation as to their whereabouts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.842" offset="7926784">There's a case that arose in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Traub against United States, which rejects that reasoning and the Court stated to refuse to follow the Lopiparo case and gave adverse reasons the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.280" offset="8004524">In other words, the witness can choose his own brand of hemlock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.337" offset="8024691">He can destroy himself either by failing to produce records called for by subpoena, even they were not in his possession or control when the subpoena was served, by refusing to answer questions even if he has claimed the privilege -- the protection of the privilege and there has been no judicial determination that it is not available or by giving incriminating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.106" offset="8119777">The Court stated that that view was plainly untenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.154" offset="8139943">Now, we say it's no answer that the Government could have started a proceeding to punish for a contempt for failing to produce these records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.031" offset="8179545">In such a proceeding, the burden of proof would have been upon the Government to establish that these books and records were in the possession of the petitioner.In that proceeding, there would have been the presumption of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.855" offset="8222804">In that proceeding, the petitioner could have submitted other remedies rather than his own testimony as to the whereabouts of the union books and records and not be required to furnish the incriminating evidence from his own lips.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.366" offset="8312874">We recognized that the Fifth Amendment was written in part to prevent any Congress or any court or any prosecutor from prying open the lips of an accused to make incriminating statements against his will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.330" offset="8372642">This Court has greatly spoken out plainly about the Fifth Amendment that is to be given a liberal application that it was not a historical relic to be tolerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.308" offset="8404616">It is not a constitutional nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.775" offset="8426454">We say that the principles of the cases in the Wilson or White cases should not be projected to require a person to furnish the incriminating evidence out of his own lips.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.566" offset="8497612">The argument of the Government cannot be reconciled with the principles established by the decisions of this Court as to the application of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.762" offset="8546408">We submit that this petitioner should not be required to testify to facts which would furnish a link in the chain of testimony to convict him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.931" offset="8587055">No subtle or fine distinction should be permitted to deprive this petitioner of his privilege to remain silent and the Government has conceded that if he answered these questions, they would incriminate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.804" offset="8646614">Judge Medina, writing for the Circuit Court of Appeals, stated that counsel seems to suppose that notorious criminals, racketeers and unsavory characters generally have an open sesame to the privilege guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.661" offset="8705964">We suppose nothing of the kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.981" offset="8719339">The rulings of this Court require that any assertion in good faith of the privilege against self-incrimination must be respected, whether the privilege is asserted by a criminal, a Communist, a school teacher or a business person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.367" offset="8788825">We say that by reason of these facts, the foregoing principles, this letter should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2184.405" offset="8840965">Let me first clarify the procedure here and explain why we think that the issue that we say is here, we think the Court can decide here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.856" offset="8886836">This determines the petitioner was served with two subpoenas, a personal subpoena and a subpoena duces tecum to him as secretary-treasurer of Local 269.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.359" offset="8948799">And it was served on April 9th, this may be turnable to 10th, but because the counsel wasn't available, it was put off until the 12th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.038" offset="8987564">Now, on the 12th, he was asked a lot of questions not only in his capacity as secretary-treasurer, not only in relation to the subpoena duces tecum but others and he claimed the privilege in regard to most of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.268" offset="9072410">Nothing happened, he -- he was simply told to come back on the 17th before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.711" offset="9106265">And when he came back on the 17th, the only questions that were put to him were the questions that are, at pages 6 to 7 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.967" offset="9163212">They are the only questions involved in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.860" offset="9178781">Those were the only questions asked of him on April 17th before there's been any request to the Court for a ruling, any of the sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.864" offset="9230817">And at that point, the Court looked at those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.725" offset="9246281">They are all, all 15 of them, concerned with where are the union records to which the subpoena duces tecum relates?</text>

            <text syncTime="2301.680" offset="9310124">And they weren't put to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.274" offset="9316498">As to the other 200 or on April 12th, there was no request for a ruling by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.103" offset="9343770">Nothing was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.225" offset="9348263">He was simply told to come back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.272" offset="9356413">Then when he came back on the 17th, these 15 questions were put to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.572" offset="9377625">He refused to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.960" offset="9383163">Now, some of these had been put to him back in the 12th, some had -- and was mixed in with the other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.013" offset="9415450">When the attorney came on the 17th, these had been called out and were put to indirectly and they all related to these records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.993" offset="9447320">I think it's fair to say they were -- he had been -- let me say this, that on the 12th, he had said that the union had books to his knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.915" offset="9479084">He had seen them and they weren't in his possession -- in his possession at the time that the subpoena was served on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.451" offset="9525164">But he claimed the privilege as to whether he knew who had possession whether they were in his custody as distinguished from possession and as to where they had been a few days before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.781" offset="9570513">So that -- as I say that happened on the 12th and he did admit the union had the book that he didn't have it in his possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.332" offset="9596740">When he came back on 17th, these questions, I think, can fairly be said to try to reach the question of were they in his custody, is not in his possession or did he know where they were, were they in a possession of the union, as the union which after all was the organization who's books were subpoenaed and he was the officer who would normally have charge of those books.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.229" offset="9700289">Well, he claimed the privilege then on the 17th and it was at that point that the grand jury reconvened or if they came before Judge Noonan for a ruling on the question and it was at that point that they read only these 15 questions and asked for a ruling from the judge only on these questions relating to the custody in control of the union's book.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.967" offset="9819199">The United States Attorney made no attempt to put anything else at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.431" offset="9841142">And it is true that they didn't argue with in exactly the same fashion that we intend to argue here, the reason why he had no privilege with regard to these books.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.810" offset="9898611">They talked about the fact that he didn't make a showing of incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.089" offset="9915747">But the fact is that the only question on which a ruling was sought were these questions about the union book and that was what the judge ruled and he had no privilege in regard to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.137" offset="9975933">Again -- perhaps, the ruling might have been more articulate from our point of -- of our theory --</text>

            <text syncTime="2487.266" offset="10052420">He said -- and I will just have to read it, Your Honor, in the middle of the page, "All the ones I heard, he's now read to me seem repetitions and certainly the ones that I have heard have been properly asked and should be answered.”</text>
