            <label>Mr. C. Edward Rhetts</label>
            <text syncTime="12.671" offset="154102">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.821" offset="162670">This case is here on a writ of certiorari, directed to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review that Court's affirmance of the District Court judgment, which denied petitioner's motion for summary judgment and granted respondent's cross-motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.173" offset="252113">The question in the case is as to the legality of petitioner's dismissal from the Foreign Service of the United States by the Secretary of State on December 14, 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.445" offset="321181">From 1935 until December 1951, petitioner served continuously in China as a Foreign Service Officer of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.375" offset="380844">In 1943, he was detached from the Foreign Service at the request of Secretary of War Stimson, and for two years, served as a political advisor to General Stilwell, and when that officer was relieved from command of the China-Burma Theater to General Wedemeyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.770" offset="482408">In addition to general political reporting, petitioner's duties when attached to the military involved the maintenance of a very close relationships with American Press representatives who visited the China Theater of War.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.384" offset="556910">And in accordance to the General Stilwell's policies, freely briefing such press representatives on the political situation in China which provided the background for the military operations in that theater.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.239" offset="632351">In April 1945, petitioner was recalled to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.989" offset="659310">And before leaving, he sought and obtained permission from the military authority under which he functioned to retain and to bring with him copies of various -- personal copies of various memoranda and reports, which he had prepared while on duty assigned to General Stilwell and General Wedemeyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.680" offset="774144">He arrived in Washington on April 12, 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.772" offset="798490">Now, on March 10th, 1945, more than a month before he returned to this country, the Office of Strategic Services made a raid on the offices of one Philip Jaffe, the editor of the magazine called Amerasia in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.622" offset="877902">On this occasion, the raiding officers discovered a large number of government documents originating in the files of the O.S.S., the State-War-Navy, and other departments of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.055" offset="939551">The case was immediately turned over to the FBI which after an investigation on April 18th, 1945, proposed to present the case to the Department of Justice for prosecution against the magazine editor Jaffe, a State Department employee, not the petitioner, a naval officer and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.805" offset="1050624">However, the case was not been turned over for prosecution because the State and Navy Departments requested that the FBI's investigation be continued for an additional period.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.665" offset="1098062">On the next day, April 19th, 1945, petitioner was introduced to Jaffe by an American naval officer on duty in the Far Eastern branch of the Office of Naval Intelligence here in Washington, who quite unknown to petitioner was one of those implicated in the wholesale of government document thievery which the O.S.S.and the FBI had uncovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.239" offset="1260335">And so, it came about that when petitioner was introduced to what he supposed to be a reputable journalist, the editor of a specialist magazine on Far Eastern Affairs by what he supposed to be a reputable naval officer on duty in the Office of -- Office of Naval Intelligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.722" offset="1358242">He was in fact being introduced to a man on whom the FBI's net had already closed and who was quite literally wired for sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.738" offset="1434311">Believing Jaffe to be a journalist of repute, the petitioner talked with Jaffe in his hotel room, in Jaffe's hotel room in the City of Washington on four different occasions between April 19th and May 29th, 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.364" offset="1520828">And he very ill-advisedly lent to Jaffe some copies of his memoranda, which I have referred to before, which he brought back with him from China.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.296" offset="1580596">These memoranda were characterized later by the Loyalty Review Board of the Civil Service Commission as being, and I quote them, "For the most part, such as a newspaper reporter on the spot would prepare for his newspaper."</text>
            <text syncTime="385.639" offset="1645902">And as to some of these, the Loyalty Review Board said they might be considered as hot news.Petitioner's conversations with Jaffe were secretly recorded by the FBI by the use of a microphone which was planted in Jaffe's hotel room.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.157" offset="1723956">On June 6th, 1945, petitioner along with Jaffe, the naval officer who had introduced him to Jaffe, another State Department employee and several others were arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.727" offset="1782262">And after volunteering his testimony, petitioner was the subject of a unanimous no true bill returned by the grand jury in his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.427" offset="1837119">He was thereafter duly restored to duty after hearing before the Board of Foreign Service personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.627" offset="1873899">Now, five years later, in 1950, petitioner along with the then Secretary of State Acheson and others was the subject of a personal attack on the floor of the United States Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.352" offset="1944743">And shortly thereafter, the Loyalty Review Board of the Civil Service Commission directed the State Department's Loyalty Security Board to reopen its previous favorable findings as to petitioner's loyalty and as to whether or not he was a security risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.478" offset="2041292">And directed the State Department Board to prefer charges against --</text>

            <text syncTime="953.306" offset="3916570">Now, in this case, we know for a fact that these purported digests and summaries were highly inaccurate and unreliable because one of them, a purported transcript of the conversation of May 8, 1945 was shown to petitioner at a hearing before the Tydings subcommittee.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.818" offset="4014686">This document which was exhibited to him and which is printed in the hearings of that subcommittee showed on its face that it was in many particulars highly inaccurate as a transcript of what the two men said to each other.</text>

            <text syncTime="2188.994" offset="8859355">It is important to commence here, but I should say as Mr. Justice Frankfurter said, our position here is that the Secretary violated regulations which he himself imposed on himself to control his -- as to the manner in which he would exercise his absolute discretion under the McCarran Rider.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.588" offset="8965726">Now, on this phase of the case, the place we start is the formal letter of charges which was preferred against him and which appears beginning at page 28 of the record, which was the commencement of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.848" offset="9054751">Now, this letter of charges which was dated March 24, 1950, first referred to the President's Loyalty Order and then to the regulations and procedures promulgated on March 11 by the State Department, and stating that a copy of these regulations was enclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.067" offset="9143672">The letter then refer -- preferred specific charges against the petitioner under specified sections of these regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.834" offset="9174706">And then, it advised petitioner that a hearing had been scheduled under Section 395 of these regulations, and I'm reading at the bottom of page 29, “To consider this charge with a view to making a recommendation to the Sectary of State whether or not under the provisions of the Department of State Appropriation Act, etcetera, your employment in the Department should be terminated in the interest of United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.143" offset="9303960">Now, then, the -- the statute to which reference is there made and the language which is used is what is commonly called the McCarran Rider.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.193" offset="9320155">And the language quoted is a verbatim "from the McCarran Rider," a Rider which was annually attached to the State Department Appropriation Act for a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.731" offset="9398314">The letter of charges then goes on to fix a date for hearing, invites a reply to the charges and offers to give further details of the charges orally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.051" offset="9447528">Now, we submit that on any fair view of the matter, this formal letter of charges, which in its accusation and its consequences is so much like a criminal indictment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2359.324" offset="9540629">As plainly as language can make it, it said, “We are going to give you a hearing to determine whether under the McCarran Rider, your dismissal is necessary or advisable in the interest of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.394" offset="9592978">And it said, “The answer to this question will depend in turn on whether you are found to be of doubtful loyalty or a security risk.</text>

            <text syncTime="2457.020" offset="9931421">In addition, the Secretary of State has been granted by Congress the right in his absolute discretion to terminate the employment and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.921" offset="9971022">That is a verbatim quotation from the McCarran Rider and we turn the page and then they say, “In the exercise of this right, the Department will so far as possible afford its employees the same protection as those provided under the Executive Order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.578" offset="10053674">And the regulations proceed to do just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.030" offset="10071542">So far as they're relevant here, they first provide that if the Loyalty Security Board, the State Department, if its decision is favorable to the employee and if that decision is confirmed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Administration, he will so notify the employee, and the case is closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.818" offset="10174673">In this case, the petitioner received such favorable decisions from the lawyer of the Security Board, three different times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.018" offset="10207483">Under the regulations therefore, the case should have been ended after the first of these favorable decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.472" offset="10245308">Instead, the Loyalty Review Board twice caused the case to be reopened and after the second of this, the Secretary of State interposed his own adverse determination in violation of his own regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3156.451" offset="12729135">Now, we submit that it can hardly be said that this requirement was met when the Secretary read and relied solely on this unlawful finding of the Loyalty Review Board while disregarding all the remainder of the record, all the testimony, including the favorable opinions of his own Loyalty Security Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="3254.739" offset="13122330">As I understand the Government's position that -- that the regulations were not in terms applicable, they -- it rest on these propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.815" offset="13174680">First, they say that the McCarran Rider authority, this broad authority to dismiss in the absolute discretion of the Secretary, whatever he deems it in the interest of the United States, embraces cases -- this is an argument which they have developed in page 28 of their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.600" offset="13253778">They say, “The McCarran Rider authority embraces cases other than those of persons whose loyalty or security is doubted,” a broader category.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.051" offset="13295574">Secondly, as I understand their argument, they say that the Secretary's regulations here dealt only with loyalty and security cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.490" offset="13345311">And in purport to -- to proscribe procedures applicable to some other kind of case which he might have decided under the broad authority of -- of the Rider.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.370" offset="13396825">Consequently, they say, “Since the petitioner was in fact discharged without regard to the regulation, he must have been discharged for some reason other than loyalty or security.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.311" offset="13456593">Now, of course, the trouble with this argument is that while the McCarran Rider may embrace authority to make dismissals on other than loyalty-security ground or security grounds, it certainly did embrace those grounds among others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.616" offset="13529840">Secondly, the State Department considered this legislation as it stated in the report to the Congress as an additional standard for dealing with security problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.756" offset="13570382">This petitioner was specifically charged under the McCarran Rider with being of doubtful loyalty and a security risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.510" offset="13605386">He was tried and he was found innocent on those charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.577" offset="13625657">And everybody, from beginning to end, including the Loyalty Review Board on whose unlawful finding the Secretary relied solely thought they were tried and dealing with charges of loyalty and security.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.878" offset="13698905">But the Government says, “Even though the Secretary held out a promise to be here,” he was free in the end to say, "I've never intended to apply these procedures to you that I'd said I'd apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.270" offset="13764420">I'm going to find you guilty of something other than I had charged you with and I won't even now tell you what it is."</text>

            <text syncTime="3436.560" offset="13849579">And I -- I say that this is somewhat unattractive position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.314" offset="13864626">It's not the one that the Secretary adopted for himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.796" offset="13882598">He purported, tried this man on loyalty and security grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.370" offset="13904854">And -- and even had he pursued this other technique, I can't believe that he could find the sanction of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.319" offset="13944665">And so, for both of these reasons, that is because that -- well, there remains the courts the other argument that the -- the courts have found that it was not the intent of Congress that he should impose any regulations onto himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.907" offset="14007045">And consequently, the regulations even though in terms applicable, even though the Secretary represented that they would be applied must -- may be disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.351" offset="14052812">Now, we submit that this position is -- as untenable as the Government's other position for there's no shred of -- of evidence in the legislative history of the legislation to suggest that Congress ever had any such intention affirmatively to prevent the exercise of this broad discretionary authority in accordance with civilized standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.982" offset="14163257">And indeed, there is positive evidence that the Congress by twice reenacting this legislation after receiving a report of the Secretary of State, positively approved his method of applying it because the Secretary of State has represented that he conceive the McCarran Rider to be subject to procedural limitation and advised the Congress that he had in fact promulgated procedural regulations governing his conduct, both under the McCarran Rider and under the Loyalty Executive Order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.683" offset="14314141">Consequently, we say that both for the reason that his action was arbitrary and that it was a departure from valid, applicable regulations which he imposed on himself, the decision of the Court of Appeals must be reversed.</text>
