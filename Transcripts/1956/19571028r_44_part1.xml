            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">Number 44, Clemente Martinez Perez, Petitioner, versus Herbert Brownell, Jr., Attorney General of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.979" offset="67814">Mr. Horsky.</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_a_horsky" startTime="17.888" stopTime="446.120">
            <label>Mr. Charles A. Horsky</label>
            <text syncTime="17.888" offset="71471">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.115" offset="80457">This proceeding is here on reargument pursuant to the order of the Court entered at the close of the last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.353" offset="113371">Since that order did not direct counsel to any particular matters, I am assuming that a full discussion of the issues is again appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.610" offset="146390">Perhaps I should say by way of brief preliminary that following the order of the Court last June, I reexamined the briefs -- the brief and the reply brief filed for the petitioner in the last -- at the last session, and I concluded that no further brief was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.169" offset="216607">The Government, however, has filed a supplemental memorandum which is applicable not only to this case but also to the -- to succeeding cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.299" offset="257149">As a preliminary, I think it might be helpful if I restate -- recall to your minds the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.122" offset="280451">I would not presume to do it but they're very short, and I think it would be well under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.878" offset="303438">The proceeding is an action for a declaratory judgment that the petitioner is a citizen of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.091" offset="332278">The District Court denied petitioner that relief and adjudged that he was not a citizen of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.211" offset="364774">That decision was affirmed by the court below which is the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.039" offset="392150">In each of the two courts, two provisions of the Nationality Act of 1940, as amended, were held to have taken away the American citizenship which the petitioner admittedly once had.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.994" offset="447948">The first provision is subsection (e) of Section 401, which decrees that any American citizen, whether native-born or naturalized who votes in a foreign political election or plebiscite, shall lose his American citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.853" offset="519314">The second provision which is subsection (j) of the same Section 401 decrees a like faith for any citizen, native-born or naturalized who remains outside of or flees the United States to avoid military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.634" offset="590472">Your Honors will recall that in this case, the petitioner was found to have done both of those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.477" offset="613878">Those findings were not challenged in the court below and they are not challenged here.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.060" offset="636238">The issue here is solely the question whether those subsections are within the constitutional power of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.729" offset="666854">Now, the facts can also be stated briefly which bring that issue, perhaps, into a little more clear focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.832" offset="699246">The petitioner was born in El Paso, Texas in 1909.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.205" offset="724741">At the age of about 10, he was taken by his parents to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.384" offset="745535">He stayed there until he attained his majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.623" offset="758491">He married a Mexican and he has raised a family.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.474" offset="773851">There is no finding, however, that he is or ever was a citizen of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.626" offset="798407">He returned to the United States for the first time in July 1943 and again, in July 19 -- in early 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.098" offset="836336">Both time working for a few months as a railway laborer.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.225" offset="856816">Each time, he claimed falsely to have been a native-born Mexican.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.894" offset="883566">In July 1947, however, he attempted to enter the United States as an American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.043" offset="908121">The immigration authorities citing against him the same two sections that are involved in this proceeding held that he had forfeited his American citizenship and refused him entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.468" offset="953783">In 1952, he again returned to the United States, again, by claiming falsely to be a native-born Mexican.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.620" offset="990459">Shortly after he arrived this last time, he surrendered to the immigration authorities who, following their earlier decision, held that he had forfeited his citizenship and again ordered him deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.622" offset="1046465">That deportation order has been stayed by the Court in the present case which was brought shortly after the deportation order was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.099" offset="1088366">The question at issue then is simply this, does Congress have the power under the Constitution to declare that native-born citizenship shall be -- shall be forfeited if a citizen votes in a foreign political election or remains outside of United States to avoid military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.733" offset="1182929">Those two sections are the ones involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.294" offset="1201110">Before I proceed to discuss that issue, I'd like, however, to have a -- make a few comments on the nature of the statute with which we are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.513" offset="1241966">It has several features that are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.040" offset="1256072">First, it doesn't make as -- the doing of the acts which petitioner has found to -- was found to have done, presumptive merely of an intention to abandon citizenship or to forfeit citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.709" offset="1314795">These acts are, in all cases, irrespective of circumstances and motives when not done under duress conclusive acts of forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.788" offset="1359099">Second, and by the same token, the citizen need not know and the petitioner here did not know that the acts -- the doing of these acts will entail this enormous forfeit.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.773" offset="1415001">There is no finding here that petitioner was aware of the consequences of what he did and the statute does not require any such finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.847" offset="1447288">Finally, the statute does not purport to impose this forfeiture as a criminal penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.181" offset="1476650">The loss of citizenship is a matter for administrative determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.149" offset="1496503">Sometimes, as in the present case, it is possible to obtain judicial review of the action in a civil action such as this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.210" offset="1528790">But in many cases where the acts alleged to forfeit the citizenship are performed outside the United States, there is grave doubt at least as to whether there is any judicial review of the administrative determination that citizenship has been forfeited.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.706" offset="1594723">What is certain, however, is that there is no intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.486" offset="1609874">There is no policy in this statute to treat this as a criminal punishment imposed only after the protections afforded by the Constitution for -- for a criminal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.704" offset="1666717">The petitioner has no trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.159" offset="1680614">He cannot even urge that the punishment would be cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.438" offset="1705691">The administrative procedure which is involved here, neatly sidesteps all of these constitutional guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.286" offset="1737143">We believe that these subsections, and each of them I can treat together for a moment and then I will come to them separately, exceed the power vested in Congress by the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="623.311" offset="2493231">In the first place, it seems to me clear that Congress has the power, and indeed, it has purported to exercise the power to declare a right of voluntary expatriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.750" offset="2550909">It seems to me that in -- under our Constitution which permits -- authorizes the naturalization of foreigners who wish to become citizens of this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="660.489" offset="2641920">Congress may also provide, I am clear, as it did in 1907, a half century ago that a citizen may not undertake to divide his allegiance between this country and some foreign State.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.858" offset="2703360">I'd like to state that principle in terms -- in the terms with which it was stated by the Citizenship Board of 1906.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.681" offset="2730632">And I've -- it's a brief sentence but it seems to me to summarize the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.790" offset="2751112">The board said, "No man should be permitted deliberately to place himself in a position where his services may be claimed by more than one government and his allegiance be due more than one government."</text>

            <text syncTime="961.741" offset="3846896">Well, I -- I think it -- it ought to be clear that when I say voluntary or when I'm talking about taking an oath of allegiance, that I am talking about taking an oath of allegiance irrespective of mental reservation, and I don't believe that mental reservations ought to have any place in this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1002.504" offset="4010005">In this case, the important element in both of these subsections, and I could still generalize them together, is that the action taken by petitioner had nothing to do with foreign nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.330" offset="4081267">Voting is defined in subsection (e) as just plain voting, pure and simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.362" offset="4105404">It does not require that he'd take an oath of allegiance or have any nationality in a foreign state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.296" offset="4129123">Leaving the country or in this case, staying out of the country to avoid military service, gave him no other citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.858" offset="4163396">It operates in both of these subsections to leave the man a stateless person if it -- if he happens to be a dual national or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.011" offset="4204042">If he is not a dual national, that's just too bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.555" offset="4214178">He therefore has no -- no nationality at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.603" offset="4234344">Now, the -- the basis for my argument and perhaps that will help to clarify this matter of voluntariness, lies in two areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.350" offset="4273319">The first is our constitutional history and the second is the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.205" offset="4296725">The constitutional history, I can skip over very quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.703" offset="4310727">The fact is that this power, as I see it, was not asserted for 150 years after the Constitution began.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.061" offset="4352209">There was plenty of controversy about citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.362" offset="4365375">There was the war of 1812 about the right of people to become American citizens and cast off their foreign allegiance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.026" offset="4396095">It was the problems of the right of expatriation which was finally solved by Congress in 1868 by a declaration of that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.257" offset="4429009">They were the problems of the Fourteenth Amendment but it was not until 1940 when voting in a foreign political election was first made an act of expatriation that the kind of a power which is not asserted for Congress was first asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.453" offset="4489718">Now, in the decisions of the -- of this Court, I think that I find support for the proposition that it requires that the power of Congress is limited to defining what will be voluntary expatriation, that there is no power of involuntary expatriation taken without the concurrence of the citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.060" offset="4584176">The first case is Wong Kim Ark against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.413" offset="4605597">There, it was claimed, as you will recall, that Wong was born in San Francisco of Chinese parents ineligible to citizenship was not a citizen and that therefore, he should be denied admission to the United States when he went on a visit to China -- readmission to United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.880" offset="4675500">This Court ordered Wong re-admittance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.827" offset="4687308">It rejected the view that what Congress could do by way of naturalization or failure to make naturalization available to Wong's parents could affect Wong's citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.493" offset="4737881">And if I may use Justice Gray's specific words, he said, "No act or omission of Congress, as to providing for the naturalization of parents or children of a particular race, can affect citizenship acquired as a birthright by virtue of the Constitution itself without any act of legislation."</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.768" offset="4827011">I read Wong Kim Ark as teaching that when we are dealing with native-born citizenship, we're dealing with a constitutional right not subject to the power of Congress to take away or to control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.355" offset="4885420">Now, the Government would find that teaching put to one side or overruled by the decision in Mackenzie against Hare, and I'd like to take some time on that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1376.582" offset="5506299">Now, let me -- let me deal with Mackenzie against Hare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.250" offset="5520927">Mrs. Mackenzie, you may remember the facts, I'm about to make a statement and let me state it very briefly, Mrs. Mackenzie married her husband, a British citizen and subject in California in 1909.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.191" offset="5572754">She had always lived there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.465" offset="5577770">She was married there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.621" offset="5582472">She continued to live there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.472" offset="5589786">But in 1913 she tried to vote and the registrar said that she was no longer a citizen because she had married a British subject and become a British citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.948" offset="5631791">Mrs. Mackenzie claimed that that statute, and that was the Act of 1907, that was one of the subsections, was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.628" offset="5666482">This Court said it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.548" offset="5678184">This Court cited what it called the ancient principle of jurisprudence that a husband and wife in public affairs were merged and the husband was the dominant feature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.713" offset="5730847">And the respondent in that case had pointed out as -- so far as I know was true, that in every country at that time, marriage of a woman to a foreigner gave her the nationality of her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.328" offset="5789257">Viewing the matter in that light, the Court said that there needn't be any dissent from the doctrine stated in the Wong Kim Ark case, which Mrs. -- Mrs. Mackenzie had cited and relied upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.821" offset="5843278">And then the Court said, "It may be conceded that a change of citizenship cannot be arbitrarily imposed, that is, imposed without the concurrence of the citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.806" offset="5915167">The law in controversy does not have that feature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.375" offset="5925407">It deals with a condition voluntarily entered into with notice of the consequences."</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.015" offset="5947977">In other words, as the Court saw it in the light of the then current concepts of husband and wife, Mrs. Mackenzie's act of marriage to her husband by which she became a British citizen was tantamount to naturalization in the British Empire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.281" offset="6021120">Whether the issue will be decided the same way today, it is doubtful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.433" offset="6037629">It will -- it will not come up because Congress itself, two years after the Nineteenth Amendment repealed that Section of the 1907 Act and it has not been reinstated in the 1940 Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1544.376" offset="6177437">The case wouldn't have -- wouldn't be any problem at all except that she managed to persuade the District Court to find that she didn't intend by that to do anything to her American citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.236" offset="6216934">Now, assuming that that was believable, I think this Court properly held it irrelevant in view of what she had done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.701" offset="6246713">As I say, I don't think you can divide or dilute your allegiance by doing the obvious thing which would give you another citizenship and would abandon your American citizenship and then say, “I didn't mean it,” when it's -- when some of the unfortunate or unhappy consequences begin to dawn on you, and that's what Mrs. Savorgnan did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.918" offset="6331664">Now, I might also point out as one last item of reference that as late as last May, this Court, in Rabang against Boyd, did refer in somewhat a language reminiscent of Wong Kim Ark to the constitutionally secured birthright of citizenship acquired by the American-born in distinguishing it from the nationality which it held there not subject to -- to constitutional protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="2402.626" offset="9610449">Well, let me say, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.623" offset="9614420">I do not mean to say that I would -- I am not urging and -- and one of the points in the brief which I have filed does urge that the Due Process Clause is also a barrier in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.069" offset="9668232">I cannot conceive as I have just said of the appropriateness of the punishment of forfeiture of citizenship for this act of voting in a foreign election but I -- I would like also to -- to say that I think that a more basic objection is present and that is that Congress here is assuming to say we can take it away if we want to when it's given by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.645" offset="9762482">Now, let me turn to subsection (j) which may illustrate this point a little bit better because subsection (j) is clearly a matter in which Congress has already legislated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.106" offset="9800411">Subsection (j) makes it an expatriating act to leave the country or to remain out of the country to avoid military service in war time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.295" offset="9853179">This is already a matter which Congress has punished or has provided for in the criminal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.475" offset="9881809">It is provided rather severe penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.937" offset="9895706">This penalty still remains but if the particular person evades military service in a particular way by going out of the country, he encourages this additional forfeiture of his citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.065" offset="9956206">Again, he doesn't acquire, as you understand, any new nationality or any new allegiance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.690" offset="9974700">He simply loses his American citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.628" offset="9990478">Now, I think that this also presumes -- this also assumes for Congress a power of involuntary expatriation, a power to deal as it wishes with American citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.917" offset="10047634">This one, however, I think, is subject to an additional difficulty and that is that it purports to impose a criminal penalty without any of the protection which the Constitution affords in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.322" offset="10109283">On the face of it, it is obviously a criminal penalty -- it looks like a criminal penalty or obviously illegal acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.429" offset="10141675">When you look into its history, that conclusion becomes irresistible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.123" offset="10168424">It happens that we, in the Government, are not in dispute on the origins of subsection (j).</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.721" offset="10190785">Both of us find it in a law which was enacted in 1865, which punished deserters and draft dodgers whether or not they left United States by loss of the rights of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.642" offset="10254524">The willingness of the Government to conceive this paternity to the 1865 statute apparently stems from its desire to be able to say that it has a hundred years of history behind it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.758" offset="10315024">What the Government is unwilling to recognize, however, is that if the statute is going to have -- to be the parent for one purpose, it must be the parent for all purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.978" offset="10355879">And it must recognize that the 1865 statute was construed by this Court to require a -- a criminal conviction before the loss of the rights of citizenship could ensue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.326" offset="10425260">It was a criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.410" offset="10441561">Now, there isn't any doubt about that fact although the Government rather studiously avoids mentioning it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.153" offset="10472594">The case -- the first case came up under it in 1866, the year after it was enacted when a man wanted to vote in Pennsylvania although he had violated the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.471" offset="10513868">Judge Strong in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, Judge Strong, who was later to become a Justice of this Court in about four years, held that the statute had to be construed in order to save it under the Constitution as requiring a criminal conviction, a conviction in that case by court-martial before the penalties can attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.457" offset="10605819">Then some years later, the question came up to this Court in Kurtz against Moffitt in 115 United State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.399" offset="10637584">And this Court, quoting and citing Judge Strong's decision said of the 1865 Act, which, by that time, had gotten into the revised statutes, that it "can only take effect upon conviction by court-martial” as was clearly shown by Mr. Justice Strong in Huber against Riley and has been uniformly held by the civil courts as well as by the military authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.714" offset="10738834">Now, the 1865 Act clearly was absorbed into the 1940 Act but in two bites.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.113" offset="10768405">The first part which related to desertion in time of war became subsection (g), and subsection (g), as you will note from looking at it, makes explicit what this Court had held was implicit in the 1865 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.832" offset="10835278">That criminal conviction must precede any application of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.867" offset="10859416">That is now specifically made the law of subsection (g).</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.619" offset="10878433">The other part of the Act, which related not to desertion but to draft dodging, avoiding the draft, came in by later amendment in 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.667" offset="10922632">But that subsection, for reasons which are not clear, omitted the requirement of a prior criminal conviction before this could apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.579" offset="10966309">The legislative history of that 1944 amendment makes it abundantly clear that Congress thought it was imposing an additional penalty on draft dodgers, on the kind of a draft dodger that might not be caught by the law and put in prison because he was outside the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.395" offset="11053558">The Government would dispose of the comments in the legislative debates on that Section when they talk about penalties and punishments as -- I think the word they use is occasional lapses into -- into less accurate language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.810" offset="11131193">But I -- we have set them all out in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.774" offset="11139030">I submit they show quite clearly that Congress thought it was going to punish these people, that they deserve punishment, they ought to be punished and that this was the way to get at them when they were outside of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.058" offset="11204232">This is punishment imposed, in other words, without the protections of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.580" offset="11226279">And I think it should be stricken down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.362" offset="11241430">But before I close, let me try and put the case in perspective, at least put it in -- in my perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.084" offset="11288242">To me, this concept of forfeiture of citizenship by administrative act, by an administrative official saying it's gone, is a very frightening business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.092" offset="11348323">The right of citizenship which you acquire by birth in this country is probably the most important constitutional right you have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.327" offset="11389283">Once that is taken away, you are here then in this country by sufferance and by tolerance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.219" offset="11412793">You can be expelled, banished, and once you're banished, you have no constitutional rights left at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.829" offset="11451246">So the right we're talking about is not, by any means, a minor right, it is the major right of Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.355" offset="11485414">Now, I think I detect in the brief of the Government some appreciation of the dangers or of the fears that might be raised by the application of this newly asserted power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.892" offset="11539540">The Government concedes or perhaps, more accurate I should say, emphasizes that this power can be -- can be utilized for conduct of only a particular kind and the words that they use to describe this limitation are conduct closely related to the cardinal elements of nationality and allegiance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.628" offset="11658449">Those words would carry a good deal more comfort to me if they were not already construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.334" offset="11681332">In this case and in this brief to apply to voting for beer and wine in liquor stores in Canada which to me is anything but closely related to the cardinal elements of nationality and allegiance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.884" offset="11743504">But even if you are to take them at face value, they seem to me to offer very little comfort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.248" offset="11772970">They assert a power in Congress to define the cardinal elements of nationality and allegiance and to provide that unless those cardinal elements exist, you are not worthy of citizenship and it's taken away from you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.892" offset="11847471">This can be done by administrative action with -- with or without judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.231" offset="11872862">It may be possible, it may not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.128" offset="11884460">This is not done to punish anybody for a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.069" offset="11900238">This is simply a congressional definition of 100% Americanism and an administrative determination as to who is 100% and who is 90%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.971" offset="11939840">The 90% aren't worthy of citizenship and it's taken away from them, and that's the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.634" offset="11966485">That, to me, is a terribly frightening prospect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.412" offset="11985607">I think the decisions of this Court and the history of this country deny that any such powers that was ever contemplated for Congress, I think the power that Congress is now trying to assert finds no support in -- it certainly is denied by the Wong Kim Ark decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.820" offset="12075259">It was explicitly denied in the Mackenzie against Hare.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.811" offset="12095216">It finds no support in Savorgnan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.618" offset="12106397">It seems to me to be inconsistent with the statement made in Rabang against Boyd.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.429" offset="12125623">And it seems to me utterly inconsistent with the nature of American constitutional government that a constitutional right, a right derived without the necessity for legislation or judicial action, derived from the Constitution can be taken away by a congressional definition of citizenship for who is or who is not worthy of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.370" offset="12209424">I submit that such a power is that should be finally and firmly forbidden.</text>

            <text syncTime="3153.349" offset="12613381">I suggest to the Court that the real burden of the arguments in these cases is that a citizen knows owes no allegiance to any country regardless.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.757" offset="12682971">The facts that we have to deal with in this particular case, since this Court deals with cases and controversies, should be looked at again to see what happened here with regard to Perez.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.541" offset="12754129">He was born in the United States but the fact show that both of his parents were Mexicans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.448" offset="12789760">And under the Mexican law just as -- is the case with our law, he was a citizen of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.855" offset="12823406">Now, whether he ever did anything to expatriate himself or denationalize himself under Mexican law is not shown in this record and there's no finding in regard to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.696" offset="12870740">And there is no specific finding that he is a dual national.</text>

            <text syncTime="3269.602" offset="13078361">It's a relevant factor because of the problem that Congress has been trying to deal with since 1868 when they provided that a person -- a citizen of the United States could expatriate himself as to a foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.356" offset="13145339">Now, you've got to be able to have it both ways and Congress was trying to deal with the problem that all of us in this country are immigrants as we go back on our various lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.703" offset="13194762">And there are all kinds of calls upon the citizens of this country as they came over here for all kinds of obligations of citizenship to the countries from which they came.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.070" offset="13252232">And we had the various obligations that we imposed upon our citizens after they arrived here and it got to the place that in deal -- dealing with those problems in the conduct of our foreign affairs, there would be demands by certain countries, Germany is a good example and many others, in which they call upon our people to render service in the armed forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.965" offset="13359856">And of course the war of 1812 is a classic example of where the British wanted these various persons that we claim are our citizens to serve in their name, proceed to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.640" offset="13418475">And it was therefore a clash between the two sovereignties that was constantly produced that Congress was trying to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.765" offset="13455047">And so after they passed the statute in regard to desertion and draft evasion in 1865, more than 100 years ago, they also proceeded in 1868 to provide that any American citizen could determine for himself that he want to get read of any other nationality that he had and proceed to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.406" offset="13565597">That was the first time that Congress recognized that the citizen should have that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.022" offset="13588062">But that was the basic thing they were trying to deal with in this whole area was the problem that was imposed upon our Government by dual or multiple claims of citizenship by several sovereign powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.109" offset="13660369">So here, we have a man who's, on the face of the record, was the citizen of both countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.827" offset="13691298">Now, let's see where his allegiance was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.433" offset="13709688">He was born in 1909.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.949" offset="13723794">1919 and 1920 sometime between those two dates, he went to Mexico with his parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.536" offset="13766113">Did he come back here to get this valued citizenship all of the opportunities that were available to American citizens?</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.493" offset="13805923">He lived in Mexico from 1919 or 1920 to June 19th, 1952, except for the few times I'll call your attention to that he came back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.573" offset="13866214">And when he came back, did he say, “I am an American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.277" offset="13885022">I'm claiming all these precious rights, and I also want to perform all of the obligations that an American citizen owes his country”?</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.092" offset="13928281">He did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.906" offset="13943536">In 1932, after he was informed that he was born in Texas, he married a Mexican national.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.560" offset="13994214">He has seven children by that wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.360" offset="14017411">The record -- so far as the record goes, they've always been resident of Mexico along with his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.728" offset="14058893">In 1940, he knew he should register at the outbreak of World War II but he didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.238" offset="14100898">He didn't want allegiance to the United States, enough to perform any obligation with that character.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.948" offset="14135693">July 28, 1943, he applies for admission to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.423" offset="14161607">Does he say he is an American citizen, value any of his rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.343" offset="14189296">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.171" offset="14196611">He says he is a Mexican, stating that he was born in Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.991" offset="14219912">Now, in 1928, many years before that, he was informed that he was born in the United States, and he was admitted in July 28, 1943 for a temporary period in the United States on the statement that he was a Mexican national and was born in Mexico when he knew the fact he is to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.837" offset="14331298">Then in March 1944, he returned to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.201" offset="14356793">He doesn't value his privilege so that he cares to stay much in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.312" offset="14389185">In April 1944, he again applies for admission as a Mexican alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.008" offset="14415935">He never says a word about being an American man and is admitted temporarily.</text>

            <text syncTime="3764.377" offset="15057502">Now, questions were asked from the bench as to why in the history of this provision about a political -- voting in a political election, why was that included as a reason for a person losing his citizenship and there was a committee consisting of the Attorney General and the Secretary of the State, Secretary of Labor who was given the responsibility by this Government back in 1938, a number of years ago, to try to ascertain what should be done about this problem of expatriation in a number of different areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.851" offset="15215386">And they didn't just come out that year with the particular recommendation to the Congress but they instituted a series of studies that lasted over a period of about two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.520" offset="15266064">And then they presented to the Congress which acted in 1940, their recommendations about a series of these various provisions that should be included to take care of this fundamental problem as it had originated and developed in the conduct of our foreign affairs, immigration and the other problems that the Government had had to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.104" offset="15364389">And this is what they say about a political election and they told the Congress at that time that it's part of the history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3850.957" offset="15403781">It was the Cabinet Committee which proposed the national -- Nationality Act of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.501" offset="15429904">This is the quotation, "Taking an active part in the political affairs of a foreign state by voting in a political election therein is believed to involve a political attachment and practical allegiance thereto which is inconsistent with continued allegiance to the United States, whether or not the person in question has or acquires the nationality of the foreign state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.267" offset="15557068">In any event, it is not believed that an American national should be permitted to participate in the political affairs of a foreign state and at the same time retain his American nationality.</text>

            <text syncTime="4054.391" offset="16217548">I think it's dealing with a case or controversy theory that this Court follows that here, you have before you, the -- what seems to me the more a fortiori case where you have dual citizenship problem because there, according to the whole history of our country, the -- the Congress is solving something fundamentally dealing with the clashes between sovereign nations and it must be dealt with in order for our country to be able to handle foreign affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4087.510" offset="16349936">And therefore, you have a different problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4089.554" offset="16358191">Now, I think that -- that you have that kind of a problem in Trop, anyway as we deal with that case but only as to desertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.644" offset="16402495">Because there, we don't have a question of dual nationality, we have the question of whether or not there -- it is a reasonable exercise as applied to the principle of desertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4113.212" offset="16452754">But it seems to me that in this particular case, in the facts that you're dealing with here on the principle, the Court has always followed that this deals with the facts in a particular case before it, whatever they are, not the hypothetical cases that might be propounded to it that here, we have a dual national problem and it's more -- very nearly comparable to me to the Mackenzie against Hare situation and the Savorgnan case in regard to the problem of whether or not they can continue to have the allegiance to another country as exemplified so clearly in this case and be -- be able to enjoy the benefits of the citizenship in United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.814" offset="16667167">Now, it seems to me that the Court must address itself too to the great problem and the great issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.408" offset="16697574">Is citizenship in the United States a one-way street as the expression goes?</text>
            <text syncTime="4181.237" offset="16724846">Or are there obligations as well as privileges?</text>

            <text syncTime="4195.492" offset="16781897">But if a man says, “This thing that's so precious to me, the idea of being an American citizen, being able to call upon my country when I go into various places throughout the world, to protect me diplomatically and otherwise in my various activities,” and in the same breath say, “I won't fight to protect the life of that country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4228.698" offset="16914704">I will go out of that country and live for the whole term of the war and stay there so I can't be prosecuted,” and you'll recall that you can be prosecuted several times after you served once for evading the draft.</text>

            <text syncTime="4325.370" offset="17301420">Now, Congress, it seems to me, could very well decide that in the other case, a man who rejects this fundamental basic obligation of citizenship and won't even fight to protect this thing that he says is so precious to him more than anything else could also be classified or included but this Court has held because Congress doesn't include everything in a particular statute, it doesn't make it invalid that it can deal with a part and still be a constitutional action by the Congress.</text>
