            <text syncTime="469.048" offset="1979538">Now, I think that I might, at this point before I go on further, clarify one other point.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.731" offset="2010258">There is a right to appeal from the decision of the assesses fixing the damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.695" offset="2050173">And in the North Laramie case, which is cited in my brief, it was indicated that as long as there is that right to appeal and there is publication of the decision, the second publication after the first, that in that particular case, all of the rights of the rights of the owner of the property had been preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.549" offset="2129586">I might add by the way that the record in the North Laramie case shows that the complaining party actually had notice pursuant to the publication after the assessment, the appraisal of damages, that he actually had notice of the appraisal of damages and he did not exercise his right to appeal, and this Court I think quite properly threw him out.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.477" offset="2225298">In our case, there again would be a right to appeal to the courts from the appraisal.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.654" offset="2254033">But again, there is a 30-day limitation on that, and again, no notice was given by publication or any other way of the actual fixing of the damages on appraisal.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.770" offset="2306487">So that this man never had any notice at any time and the only publication was one publication one day, and there was no other notice at all, even though the statute provides an alternative method.</text>

            <text syncTime="1007.936" offset="4135163">Well, when you look at the record, the transcript of the record on page 6 of it, you find that in addition to publication, the United States Marshal was directed to serve a copy of the notice upon such owners as can be found within the District of Columbia where the case arose and upon tenants and occupants of the city.</text>
