            <text syncTime="31.062" offset="227662">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.692" offset="242186">This case, the United States against Turley, reaches this Court on direct appeal in the District Court for the District of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.247" offset="280325">The sole issue involved is the meaning of the word “stolen” as used in the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.899" offset="322957">In April 1956, an amended information was filed against the defendant in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.049" offset="351587">There was only one count.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.833" offset="358693">It appears on page 4 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.841" offset="374784">Your Honors would -- in front of you, I think it will help get the facts very clearly in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.498" offset="413341">The information alleged that a year ago, January 1956, James Turley did lawfully obtain a certain Ford automobile from its owner, with permission of the owner to use the automobile briefly, on that day to transport certain of their friends to the homes of the latter in Columbia, South Carolina, and to return with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.118" offset="515845">But that after so obtaining the automobile and transporting said persons to their homes, and before returning with them or delivering back the automobile to its owner, Turley, without permission of the owner, and with the intent in South Carolina to steal the automobile, did convert the same into his own use and did unlawfully transport it in interstate commerce from South Carolina to Baltimore, Maryland, knowing it to have been stolen, where he did on the next day, sell the automobile without permission of the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.015" offset="675401">The statute involved is even shorter.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.256" offset="692433">It's one sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.802" offset="698598">It appears on page 2 of the Government's brief, “Whoever transports in interstate or foreign commerce a motor vehicle or aircraft, knowing the same to have been stolen, shall be fined not more than $5000 or imprisoned not more than five years or both.”</text>
            <text syncTime="174.034" offset="799535">The defendant moved to dismiss the information on the ground that it did not state an offense against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.343" offset="832763">The District Court construed the word “stolen” in the statute as applying only to those motor vehicles which had been acquired in such a way that their acquisition would have constituted the offense of larceny as understood at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.584" offset="909667">The District Court then found that the circumstances here involved would not have involved the offense of larceny as understood at common law and dismissed the information.</text>

            <text syncTime="220.379" offset="984900">The United States agrees that under the circumstances of this case, the -- the conduct be -- would not have constituted the offense of larceny at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.444" offset="1025128">So, the sole issue is one of statutory construction as to whether the word “stolen”, as used in this Act, is limited to those stolen vehicles and limited to those vehicles that require in a manner which would have constituted common-law larceny or whether “stolen” has the more common everyday meaning of a stolen car, a hot car is used, generally understood in the contemporary community.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.178" offset="1144038">The Government's position in the word “stolen” is used in the general accepted -- generally accepted meaning of having been taken from one's own use without right and with the intent to deprive the owner of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.584" offset="1205687">We -- more technically, we think that stolen vehicles are those taken by any of the theft crimes, namely, larceny, larceny by trick, false pretenses or embezzlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.189" offset="1256155">We do not think the word should be construed that a stolen vehicle should be analogized to a verb stealing, take one -- taken by stealing that stealing necessarily means larceny, that larceny means larceny as defined at common law for there were statutory crimes, embezzlement and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.616" offset="1325850">The appellee's position here is basically that criminal statute must be construed narrowly, that as between the two meanings that might be given to stolen, the common-law definition is narrower and he suggest more definite.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.941" offset="1395127">He concludes that under the statute, no vehicle could be considered a stolen vehicle but the circumstances in which were acquired would have constituted larceny as understood at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.388" offset="1452910">The -- there is no definition of stolen in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.056" offset="1471613">The legislative history is not decisive.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.939" offset="1483107">We get some help from it, but I will touch on that in a moment.</text>

            <text syncTime="544.817" offset="2282663">This phrase “with the intent to deprive the owner of the possession thereof” was deleted by the Senate and remained out of the bill.</text>

            <text syncTime="622.277" offset="2592475">The intent was -- was specifically to take care the intent to deprive the owner to use referred to at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.737" offset="2626330">The fact that it was considered to be surplusage indicates that they understood that theft will include depriving the owner, dishonestly, this property, whether the intent occurred at the time the automobile was originally acquired or whether the intent occurred at the time it was disposed of.</text>

            <text syncTime="2060.648" offset="8345997">The significance I think, Your Honor, is that this Court when it was first placed with the Dyer Act, it felt that the Dyer Act was aimed at organized conspiracies of thieves who had “schemes of larceny” to take cars across state lines and sell them, the point being that these organized groups of thieves operate in ways which are traditionally within the framework of common-law larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.342" offset="8460727">This Court so thought, the lower court in this case so thought, and it was admitted by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that this was the situation which primarily motivated the Congress when they passed the Dyer Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.776" offset="8518510">I'm referring now to Smith versus United States, one of the cases giving a broad construction to the Dyer Act, withholding that they must admit that typically an unattended car is taken and that this is the traditional form of common-law larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.575" offset="8601684">I think then that it is not unreasonable to suspect that Congress did not have in mind all of the various ramification of wrongful taking at the time that this Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.561" offset="8649644">Congress was acting or reacting to a need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.747" offset="8662392">There was a clearly felt need and the conscious action of the Congress was directed toward common-law larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.676" offset="8694053">Now, there are other indications of that fact which I feel in all frankness are not determined, given in anyway of the issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.598" offset="8733759">For example, the title of the Act, the Motor Vehicle Theft Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.526" offset="8757478">The Government argues in its brief that the word "theft" is broader than common-law larceny, and it cites Bouvier's Law Dictionary for that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.005" offset="8799378">I feel that the word "theft" is a synonym for larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.274" offset="8816515">It was soused by Blackstone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.312" offset="8824665">Other cases have indicated that the word “theft” is a synonym for larceny as understood at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.353" offset="8856743">There's the matter of Senator Nelson's statement about the textbooks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.065" offset="8875656">That was a statement made during the course of debate and perhaps is not entitled of great significance, but surely it must refer to common-law larceny and to treat as is that so define common-law larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.819" offset="8942634">Now, in view of the fact that the legislative history of the Dyer Act is not itself conclusive, comes in paramount importance, I think to consider the word that Congress used in the Act itself, the word “stolen” and the meaning of the word “stolen”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.536" offset="9017553">In this regard, we have I think the help of a number of set of rules of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.950" offset="9043153">It should be presumed that Congress understood when it used the word “stolen” in the Dyer Act, that a common-law term which is used in a criminal statute and is not otherwise defined by the text takes its common law meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.325" offset="9104697">Now, I have cited in the brief a number of decisions of state courts holding most emphatically that the word "steal" is synonymous with the word “larceny” as understood at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.628" offset="9157883">Now, it is true that the word “larceny” is not often defined by use of the word “steal”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.260" offset="9188394">It is, however, also true that the word “larceny” in its traditional definition is also -- or that the traditional definition given to the word “larceny” at common law is also the traditional definition of the word “steal”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.899" offset="9263000">Now, there are other definitions of the word “steal” over and above broader than the common-law larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.137" offset="9287868">But in all of the dictionaries, I think, the definition which coincides with common-law larceny is the primary meaning given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.768" offset="9322454">The other meanings are given as second and additional meanings as Funk and Wagnalls says in definition too loosely to acquire by other means than stealing -- than larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.818" offset="9382640">I think we must presume that Congress intended to use the word in its primary and most important and well-understood sense, rather than in a loose and largely undefined sense when it passed the Dyer Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.718" offset="9446275">I think Congress must be presumed to understand that criminal statutes are traditionally strictly construed and that clear and unequivocal language must be in an Act before it will be extended by court to cover other offenses not clearly within the meaning of the words used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.874" offset="9534882">Now, I think also with respect to the matter of purpose of the Act, that the history of the Dyer Act in connection with the National Stolen Property Act and the National Stolen Cattle Act is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.576" offset="9609697">The Dyer Act was passed in 1919.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.523" offset="9621504">It uses only the word “stolen”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.041" offset="9631535">It is the contention of the appellee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.290" offset="9640521">Of course, the word “stolen” refers to the traditional kind of common-law larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.325" offset="9664658">And when in 1934, the National Stolen Property Act sections were passed relating to securities and money transported across state lines or the receipt of securities and money which were transported across state lines, that Act used other -- an additional words to the word “stolen”, which clearly indicated an intention to broaden the scope of the -- meaning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.402" offset="9768939">The reason I think is that securities and moneys are more traditionally subject to taking by embezzlement than would be an automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.680" offset="9818049">When later in 1941 the National Cattle Theft Act was passed, again, the Congress reverted to the use of the word "stolen" alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.170" offset="9856084">That Act also says simply knowing the same to have been stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.893" offset="9874996">Can we not see that the reason for that is that cattle are traditionally stolen in a sense of taking which would be common-law larceny?</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.627" offset="9913866">It is not often I think that cattle are embezzled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.420" offset="9925047">Congress felt no need to extend the scope of the statute beyond the common-law larceny type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.451" offset="9961200">When Title XVIII of U.S.C. was codified in 1948, all of the sections were adopted and put under one heading, but they all retained their own words as they had before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.027" offset="10019506">So, with the Dyer Act stole -- says "stolen”, the Act relating to securities and money contains additional phraseology and the Cattle Act also says "stolen".</text>

            <text syncTime="2740.776" offset="11066493">The point is that if the word is otherwise undefined, it takes the meaning of common-law larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.158" offset="11095960">The Courts that have held adverse to my position here have quoted liberally from Crabb versus Zerbst and from United States versus Stone, cited in my brief on page 19 and on page 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.655" offset="11177984">Those cases are often cited as authority for the fact that the word "stolen" has a broader meaning than that of common-law larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.303" offset="11208600">But in those cases and in each of the other cases cited by the Government, the statute was broader in its own language than is the Dyer Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.929" offset="11251127">That was pointed out quite clearly by Judge Hammond in the United States versus Stone case, when he said that “in spite of the fact that the word "stolen" can mean more than common-law larceny, I would hold it here to mean only common-law larceny,” and this case involve stealing goods from a wreck within the maritime jurisdiction, were it not for the fact with the word "stolen" in that statute was joined with the words “plunder” and “destroy,” and the use of those additional words show the clear congressional intent to encompass the whole field of taking from the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.913" offset="11403055">But absent such additional words, Judge Hammond said that he would be constrained to hold that statute applicable only to common-law larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.161" offset="11435969">And that is the distinguishing point in all of these cases that the Fourth, Sixth and Ninth Circuits have relied upon in holding the Dyer Act to have a broad meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.667" offset="11489991">I think it's important to consider also what the Dyer Act means if it does not mean common-law larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.166" offset="11524054">A lot of loose language has been used in giving meaning to the Dyer Act in the broader sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.268" offset="11548400">The traditional definition used by the Fourth, Sixth and Ninth Circuits is that it covers any misappropriation without right or law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.155" offset="11595943">Other expressions have been to any wrongful taking, any dishonest taking, any unlawful taking and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.394" offset="11632933">Now, it is our position that if the Act were so broadly construed, it would be vague and indefinite to the extent that a constitutional issue might arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.719" offset="11678281">And that the Court in considering what Congress met when it passed the Dyer Act should consider that Congress would have desired to avoid any conceivable constitutional issue in using the word “stolen.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.737" offset="11734288">And that leads us again to the belief that the word means common-law larceny alone.</text>
