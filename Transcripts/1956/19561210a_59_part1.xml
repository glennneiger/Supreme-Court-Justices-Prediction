            <text syncTime="15.563" offset="165595">This case represents a review of judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit though the action is won by a merchant seaman who invokes the Jones Act, a federal statute to recover damages for personal injuries allegedly due to negligence, the Act, the federal statute, the Jones Act, being one admittedly where recovery is granted only for negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.245" offset="304358">A case was tried before Mr. Justice Conger and a jury in the United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.916" offset="331003">At the end of the plaintiff's case, the respondent moved for a directed verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.430" offset="353050">His motion was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.549" offset="361618">The case went to the jury where plaintiff had a verdict and respondent, defendant below appealed to the Circuit Court and plaintiff's judgment was reversed.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>

            <label>Mr. George J. Engelman</label>
            <text syncTime="81.851" offset="430791">No cause of action for unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.889" offset="442911">The facts are substantially these, the plaintiff was employed as a member of a crew of respondent's vessel, Brazil, which was on a 40-day -- 42-day cruise to South America carrying 500 first class passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.342" offset="516786">In addition to his duties as a baker, during the evening meal at night, he had the job of filling the orders of waiters for ice cream.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.348" offset="568717">The ice cream was kept in the bakeshop adjacent to the galley.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.865" offset="598810">It was stored in two and a half gallon containers in what is known as a tempering or dispensing chest such as we are all familiar with and see in drugstores and confectioner shops.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.902" offset="683029">The only tool with which he was furnished was the usual hemispherical scoop by means of which he could press this tool into the ice cream, bring it up with a bowl, apply a liver and put it in silver conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.540" offset="765576">On the night of this accident, he said that he came on watch and he had dispensed about a half of a tub of ice cream which was of proper consistency where upon he proceeded to dispense from a new tub, but he found it hard.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.643" offset="841958">But with the exercise of considerable pressure, he was able to go down about halfway in this tub of ice cream and serve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.472" offset="885217">He then got an order from a ship's waiter for 12 portions of ice cream.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.108" offset="911757">At that point halfway down, he found the ice cream as he said as hard as a brickbat and the tool, the scoop, was utterly useless.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.189" offset="968077">He testified that he had met with this situation previously on ships and had been provided with a tool to wit an ice chipper which was a simple tool with a handle and had six or eight prongs in a vertical line.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.445" offset="1053132">And that he would take this ice chipper and dig it into the ice cream, smashing it into small pieces and then use the scoop to form it into balls.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.630" offset="1097853">Lacking the ice chipper and seeing no other tool that he might improvise with, he took a butcher knife which was lying nearby in a brittle and there's no allegation if there was any defect in the knife itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.455" offset="1173191">And using the butcher knife as a chipper, he first separated the hard ice cream from the sides of the container in order to get air in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.072" offset="1219688">And then with his hand, he -- grasping the knife in sort of a dagger-like fashion, he proceeded to hack away, making small shavings or slivers of ice cream which he formed into bowls by means of the scoop.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.821" offset="1294608">In that way, he was able to make nine servings of ice cream.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.669" offset="1318013">When the point of the knife struck a piece of ice cream that was so hard that it resisted the cutting surface and his hands slipped down the blade with the result that he was badly cut and had an injury of 60% loss of the functional use of his hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.058" offset="1411636">He testified that no one gave him a specific order to use this knife.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.460" offset="1441207">He appreciated that it was not designed as an ice chipper and he appreciated that it involved certain hazards in its use.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.952" offset="1487182">However, he relied on the compulsion of the job, the fact that he had an order from the waiter.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.433" offset="1517066">And he relied on the implications in a general order which he got from his superior when he joined the vessel in which he was told that he was working on a first class passenger vessel and that he would have to give good service, prompt service and give the waiters what they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.756" offset="1610376">Acting under those conditions, he used the knife.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.729" offset="1630333">Now, the question arises whether the respondent so conducted its business or so handled this commodity of ice cream whether it could reasonably foresee the need of an additional tool which was not supplied to wit the ice chipper or that in the alternative, it would stop serving ice cream to the passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.913" offset="1759065">Fortunately for the petitioner, there is an abundance of evidence in the case that the respondent could foresee that the tool it provided the petitioner with was totally inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.320" offset="1824684">The ice cream was stored down in D deck in considerable quantities in a deep freeze.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.110" offset="1851852">And there, it was maintained at a temperature of 5 degrees below zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.996" offset="1875362">A dairy expert testified that ice cream of that kind is too hard to be dispensable and that it requires being placed in a dispensing or tempering chest at 18 -- at 8 to 13 degrees Fahrenheit above zero for a period of 12 hours plus, 12 to 24 hours in order to become dispensable or serviceable throughout, because as it rests in this tempering chest or cabinet, the bottom part is resting on ice and it will fore out or reach a consistency for serving from the top-down.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.946" offset="2075146">Now, in answer to interrogatories, the respondent said that it maintained this dispensing chest where the ice cream was located at the time the petitioner was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.773" offset="2134497">That it maintained this chest at a temperature of -- from zero to 5 to 10 degrees which was too low.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.716" offset="2170232">It said that it brought up the ice cream from down to D deck for service at the evening meal between noon and the time of the evening service which would be anywhere from 5 to 8 hours, which was not a sufficient time.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.259" offset="2252361">The respondent's refrigerating engineer testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.558" offset="2269602">The respondent took his deposition in advance to trial and we've read it in total.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.220" offset="2296247">Petitioner read it in support of his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.911" offset="2307009">Respondent offered no evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.457" offset="2317249">He said that he couldn't say whether or not this tempering chest was in working order in condition on the day of the accident or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.757" offset="2362389">He said in substance that they had a great deal of trouble with this device.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.802" offset="2382555">In fact, they still do as of the time of his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.495" offset="2405334">And whether he looked at it that day or not, he didn't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.641" offset="2433964">He said that one of the difficulties was that when the machine was out of order, it made the ice cream too soft.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.710" offset="2474193">But taking all of that testimony together, of course, it seems particularly obvious that the fact that the -- from time to time, there was considerable difficulty with the machine and when there was that difficulty with this tempering chest, it generated too much heat.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.005" offset="2551411">Of course, explains why they maintained it at a lower temperature than they should have and why the ice cream was not brought up in sufficient time for proper pouring so as to be dispensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.427" offset="2625076">Certainly, on the basis of that testimony, the jury had the right to find and determine if this respondent could foresee the need of some tool other than the scoop.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.388" offset="2696965">The petitioner had nothing to do with the bringing of the ice cream up, the handling by the -- the chest down on D deck, the deep freeze or the dispensing chest in the galley.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.648" offset="2757987">He was a baker.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.550" offset="2761540">His sole job was to serve it during the night time.</text>

            <text syncTime="735.531" offset="3045543">The respondent said that the petitioner could've done this job by means of a spoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.012" offset="3083368">I think counsel for the respondent has it.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.265" offset="3096430">So a large spoon, it appears to me to be one that would be used on soup stock and they took the spoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.239" offset="3132374">This is it.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.167" offset="3140002">It's of some substance -- substantial and they presented it to the dairy expert who testified for the petitioner and he answered them that this would not be adequate to attack ice cream such as described to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.507" offset="3225370">Now, respondent in its brief refers of course to various implements that he might have found, but there's not a scintilla of evidence in the case that any other tool was available other than this butcher knife which the man used to do his job.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.802" offset="3318575">The case was submitted by Judge Conger to the jury on well-established principles of maritime law that the seaman was entitled to a safe place in which to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.047" offset="3363610">He was entitled to adequate tools.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.708" offset="3374164">He was entitled to reasonably safe ice cream in which to work and he was bound to obey implied as well as expressed orders, contributory negligence rule and proximate cause were given to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.601" offset="3437798">They returned the verdict and the Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the use of the knife was not within the realm of reasonable foreseeability.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.649" offset="3513971">We urge that in doing that, the Circuit Court of Appeals, United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in effect established a complete -- completely new rule of law under which a shipowner can now fail to -- to supply an appliance or can supply a defective appliance and escape liability unless he can reasonably foresee harm from the breach of his duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.294" offset="3660570">In a long line of cases in the various United States Courts of Appeals, the various circuits and in the decisions of this Court, the shipowner's duty with respect to appliances has been stated that the duty is absolute, positive, continuous during the voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.026" offset="3763493">That it is non-delegable and that due diligence does not excuse for breach of the duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.323" offset="3808632">In other words, a duty which has those attributes, those conditions attached to it, we urge that knowledge on the part of the shipowner that he breached the duty is not a necessary ingredient of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.980" offset="3899329">It is simply necessary to show the breach of the duty and rest there.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.169" offset="3924093">That is illustrated by two cases, strangely in the court below in the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.264" offset="3960456">Those cases are a Standard Oil versus Robins Dry Dock &amp; Repair Company and Shields versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.403" offset="4004968">In the Robins case, the Standard Oil had no possession and control of its vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.876" offset="4034853">The gangway was defective, but the Standard Oil was found to be liable for a defect in its gangway even though it was out of -- out of possession and control.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.562" offset="4085635">And in Shields against United States, which was liable under the Suits in Admiralty Act, the seaman was injured when the defect involved was created not by the United States, in that case, the shipowner, but it was created by an independent contractor who came aboard the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.092" offset="4175705">Under the FELA, the railroad cases, the law is substantially the same where a railroad car will go on the property of another and where that -- there are defects and the railroad man is injured by reason of those defects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.416" offset="4285001">Now, what the -- if we think that the Circuit Court here has now imposed an additional -- an additional element of negligence, it is no longer sufficient to show that the shipowner breached his duty by failing to provide a necessary tool or by supplying a hazardous form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.786" offset="4402552">You have to go further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.268" offset="4412479">You not only have to show that breach of duty, but you have to show that the shipowner could reasonably foresee that harm would come from his breach of duty and we say the fact is contrary to the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.518" offset="4485413">The Circuit Court of Appeals below cited no cases to support its premise whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.889" offset="4518954">The three cases that they cited were not in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.410" offset="4533060">One was Fowler -- it's Fitzpatrick against Fowler which involved a domestic servant, a shoreside employee here in the City of Washington where assumption of risk was held to apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="1806.674" offset="7330043">He knew the step plate to be defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.364" offset="7348851">Without any specific order, he voluntarily chose to use the defective plate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.908" offset="7371003">He had a free and un-coerced choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.832" offset="7382706">Mr. Justice Stone held there was negligence in failing to supply proper equipment and the choice of defective equipment in place of non-defect -- or the use of defective equipment in place of adequate equipment was simply a matter of the seaman's contributory negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.640" offset="7489912">On that case, a very experienced maritime counsel argued the cause and briefed it for the Socony-Vacuum Oil Company and the doctrine of foreseeability of harm was not even discussed by counsel, was never raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.815" offset="7558666">The point that was raised in the chamber of this Court on the question of assumption of risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.966" offset="7591267">It seems that -- that the shipowner has ample protection in the contributory negligence rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.221" offset="7636302">This case we believe illustrates that, a man recovered a verdict of $17,500 for 60% loss of his hand which permanently disabled him from his occupation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.144" offset="7691995">The medical testimony is not reputed in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.841" offset="7710699">And as a practical matter, the rule announced by the Circuit Court certainly is not going to help the careful shipowner, the shipowner who keeps his appliances and equipment in a safe and proper condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.357" offset="7784782">The rule will help the shipowner who doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.132" offset="7795858">He is the man who will attempt to excuse his breach of duty by saying, “I did not supply proper equipment here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.189" offset="7836087">I failed to supply equipment there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.846" offset="7846745">But it was not within the realm of my foreseeability that this particular accident occurred.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.207" offset="7876211">With the end result, the rule would result in the impairment of the efficiency of our Merchant Marine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.124" offset="7915917">It would give rise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.199" offset="7924172">Courts and juries would make such -- or certainly, juries would arrive at such diverse interpretation of where foreseeability lay with respect to the enumerable ship's appliances that the law of appliances would end up as a hunch punch and hardly any shipowner would know what he had to supply and what he didn't have to supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.876" offset="8050918">Now, as my second point is, the simple tool doctrine of this appliance, the -- the absence of the ice chipper of course is a simple tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.138" offset="8119881">The Circuit Court of Appeals did not refer to the simple tool doctrine or did not refer to the appliances as simple tools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.763" offset="8182471">The common law, the simple tool doctrine to wit of the servant used defective simple tools at his own peril is -- was based on the law of assumption of risk that he assumed the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.150" offset="8272018">He was a shoreside worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.487" offset="8281318">He could walk off the job if he wished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.020" offset="8291453">He could bring his own tools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.485" offset="8301275">The last pronouncement this Court made in a simple tool case was Jacob versus the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.219" offset="8336280">And in that case, the maritime bar without any question feels that this Court abolished the simple rule doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.119" offset="8395839">There, a -- an engineer had a monkey wrench which this Court said was probably adequate for the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.389" offset="8428962">However, for his particular work, there was aboard ship a more adaptable type of wrench and that was worn and defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.592" offset="8477759">Three requests for a new wrench had been made and had not been complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.692" offset="8502105">Instead of using the monkey wrench, he used the defective wrench and he sustained injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.356" offset="8532825">Again, the Second Circuit dismissed this case holding that there was no insufficiency of appliances and applying the simple tool doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.703" offset="8574203">This Court held that the evidence -- on the evidence, there was a jury question as to whether there was any defect or insufficiency in the ship's appliances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2134.256" offset="8640345">That case is Jacob versus the City of New York, 315 U.S. 752.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.452" offset="8701158">Now, with some language used of the question that I'm attempting to get at, whether -- whether the rule of foreseeability which the Second Circuit engrafted on to the -- to defective appliance rule, whether this foreseeability rule is engrafted on in the case of simple tools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.884" offset="8810872">Now, in that Jacob's case, this Court did use language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.809" offset="8826650">It's the first time I found it in any of the decision of this Court or in any decision that I have been able to find in any of the Circuits, did use language with respect to foreseeability and this is what it said referring to the -- referring to what the jury may have found with respect to negligence of respondent, the shipowner had said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.085" offset="8931662">It said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.706" offset="8946186">“Whether respondent, after it had knowledge of the defect might not have reasonably foreseen a possibility of resulting harm, if it allowed the worn wrench to remain in use.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.913" offset="9019016">Now, we concede there that foreseeability was an element, one of the elements of negligence in the case because a request for another wrench should've been made on three different times, but we say that it was not the necessary element.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.596" offset="9097801">In a sense, it was a superfluous element of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.196" offset="9116191">The primary negligence consisted in permitting the worn wrench to remain in use</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.605" offset="9145762">A careful shipowner properly supervising his equipment with safe and competent officers would not have permitted the worn wrench to remain in use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.963" offset="9199261">So, we say that -- or urge that the primary duty of safe appliances, a proof of that and nothing else, is sufficient in a simple tool case such as we have here as well in case -- as well as in cases of general appliances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.699" offset="9278151">Now, the Socony case, Socony-Vacuum Oil Company versus Smith, it's debatable whether the tool was a simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.663" offset="9306049">It was a small step plate or about six by six but it was a fixed tool pillar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.494" offset="9333321">And in a sense, it was a simple tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.666" offset="9354010">Now, we see -- we can see no reason why in the case of simple tools, the doctrine of foreseeability of harm from breach of duty and not appliance cases should exist when it clearly doesn't exist on the authorities in other cases, cases other than simple tools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.187" offset="9440110">The result that would be reached if you did have this doctrine engrafted on the foreseeability, if you go back and take the plaintiff's position or his dilemma that confronted him, his alternatives would be either to throw the scoop down and not do any work at all or he'd be -- have the obligation when he went aboard the ship to bring his own tools, because he'll be in a position where he could not rely on the shipowner to supply his tools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.121" offset="9591829">And again, in the Jacob's case, the -- this Court sharply criticized the -- the proposition of a simple tool doctrine of common law where it was born and invoked, shoreside cases that they won such as a seaman who moves about the world should bring aboard ship his own tools.</text>

            <text syncTime="2494.202" offset="10080214">The -- on the third point with respect to the decision of the Circuit Court is that it invokes the defense, the shipowner of assumption of risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.244" offset="10148342">In effect, what the Circuit Court held was that the petitioner in using this knife to perform his duty assumed the risk of the use of a hazardous tool when a necessary one was not provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.936" offset="10223156">Now again, coming back to the fundamental Socony-Vacuum versus Oil -- the Smith Case, this Court abolished the defense of assumption of risk in seaman's cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.426" offset="10281044">And in the concluding question that we asked here, is the defense of assumption of risk also abolished in simple tool cases?</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.294" offset="10340498">Mr. Justice Stone, at the conclude -- conclusion of his opinion in the Socony-Vacuum Oil versus Smith Case made a statement with respect to the class of cases that was not covered by the decision of the Court, and this is what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.377" offset="10420851">“We leave to future cases as they may arise, the determination of what rule is to apply in cases where the seaman's election to use an unsafe appliance is in disobedience of orders or made while not on duty.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.348" offset="10504756">He left the door open on disobedience of orders and the use of -- voluntary use of defective appliances that in those two class of cases, nothing was said or indicated that the Court would reach a different rule in simple tool cases."</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.588" offset="10585736">Now, following that decision, Congress in the Federal Employers' Liability Act, a section which we have quoted in our brief, 45 U.S.C.A. 54 abolished the defense of assumption of risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.907" offset="10667029">The language of the statute merely refers to the negligence of any of the officers, agents or employees of such carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.266" offset="10708407">And of course, that Act is incorporated into the Jones Act by reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.252" offset="10732335">The Act also refers to any statute enacted for the safety of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.399" offset="10752920">There is no such statute with respect to seaman that we know of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.114" offset="10791790">The -- the situation on -- on a parity of -- or an ironic comparison basis, certainly, the petitioner here was in a far more difficult position than Smith was in the Socony-Vacuum Oil Company case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.422" offset="10885099">Smith had a good floor plate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.358" offset="10900773">He had no specific orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.763" offset="10906415">He was not hurried up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.888" offset="10910908">He was just performing routine duties of oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.421" offset="10925014">He knew this plate was defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.600" offset="10933791">Apparently, he forgot about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.793" offset="10942568">He got on it and he was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.934" offset="10955107">He had very little -- his only compulsion was a compulsion of his job, whereas the petitioner here had the more pressing or immediate compulsion of his job, his work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.245" offset="11008397">He had a specific order for 12 servings of this ice cream and he had his general orders.He was to get the work out and give good service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.374" offset="11048835">We think that to apply any different rule because the tool involved was a simple one, would be an -- unjust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.271" offset="11092407">And of course further and our final point is that the jury verdict, the general jury verdict on the basis of the Court's charge was a finding that this man had an implied order to use the knife.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.333" offset="11168684">It's what the jury found and it was a clear finding under the judgment -- judges' charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.925" offset="11199091">Nothing is more bedrock in maritime law pertaining to seaman than the duty of obeying expressed as well as implied orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.781" offset="11246529">As a matter of fact, the same Second Circuit, not long ago in the Darlington case said the case -- cases make it clear with the safety of ships at sea might be in seriously danger but the rule otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.428" offset="11313089">Now, the cases cited by my friend are cases that deal with transitory substances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.715" offset="11362200">They are the grease and oil cases, the foreign substance cases where someone without knowledge may spill gravy, grease, banana peels or some other substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.365" offset="11420818">There is no proof that the shipowner had knowledge or an opportunity to correct the condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.560" offset="11457599">And of course, there, the cases at the present time while there are some cases permitting recovery very recently on the basis of unseaworthiness, those cases properly hold that there is no liability under the Jones Act because there's no negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.394" offset="11540982">There is no knowledge that's brought home to the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.375" offset="11556864">But here, we have a situation where a careful prudent shipowner would supply the necessary tools, the need for something in addition to that scoop, the sole tool with which the petitioner was provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.523" offset="11641501">The evidence abundantly beyond question shows the need and the necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.449" offset="11669191">Now, when they breach that duty, he was ordered to use hard ice cream and he didn't have a tool to tackle hard ice cream.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.597" offset="11705762">That was the negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.735" offset="11710360">And we say that the shipowner as the jury found is responsible for anything that flows from that, and they shouldn't be superimpose something else, the nebulous something and vested the most nebulous speculative concept that the shipowner must foresee that out of his breach, there's a possibility that harm may come over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.025" offset="11831463">We think it would be the ultimate confusion, overrides established decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2988.382" offset="12056952">The only question that is before the Court on this petition is whether or not the Court of Appeals was correct in its holding that the record shows no proof of faults on the part of the respondent for the injury to this petitioner who, although he was supplied with the customary implement which he admitted to be in good condition for serving ice cream to passengers on board the respondent's vessel, chose on his own initiative without knowledge, without consent of any of the superiors to take a butcher knife that he himself described as razor sharp that was used customarily by another member of the crew for another purpose and which the petitioner himself admitted was improper for his crew and to use that knife as a dagger to stab ice cream that he found to be hard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.853" offset="12342836">I should invite the attention of the Court to the fact at the outset that there's no question of unseaworthiness as Mr. Engelman has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.842" offset="12374706">This action has brought at law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.209" offset="12380244">It's brought for damages for personal injuries under the provisions of the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.840" offset="12402709">There has been no claim and there is now no claim that the respondent's vessel or appliances or equipment was in anyway unseaworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.626" offset="12445863">The Court is not now concerned with the application of any principle of absolute liability or liability without cause that attaches to cases of unseaworthiness under the rule in the Arseola.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.261" offset="12508453">Now, there may well be liability without cause imposed on a vessel owner under the doctrine of unseaworthiness for injuries caused by unsafe working conditions, but no case has been cited by the petitioner holding that liability maybe imposed under the Jones Act without full proof of negligence, and there is no case that so hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.497" offset="12625377">Those decisions under the Jones Act that place the vessel owner under the non-delegable duty to provide a seaman with a safe place to work go no further than to hold that the owner is responsible for the negligence of a third person to whom the owner has entrusted the duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.602" offset="12717746">The gist of this action is negligence and an order to establish a cause of action against this respondent under the Jones Act, the petitioner had the burden of proving substantial evidence of fault on the part of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.807" offset="12778559">Without that proof, there can be no recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.577" offset="12793710">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in De Zon against the American President Lines, made clear what is the status of the negligence proof required in a Jones Act case, a case that was incidentally affirmed in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.146" offset="12859956">The Court of Appeals said, “We must be mindful of the fact that although the Jones Act has given a cause of action to the seaman who has suffered personal injury for the negligence of his employer, still it does not make that negligence, which was not negligence before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.217" offset="12952221">It does not make the employer responsible for acts or things which do not constitute a breach of duty.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.341" offset="12992763">That same principle has been stated by this Court in two decisions that are referred to at page 9 of the respondent's brief, Jamison against Encarnacion and Jacob against the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.688" offset="13046157">That principle has also been recognized implicitly in the Socony-Vacuum Oil Company against Smith case that was referred to by Mr. Engelman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.435" offset="13085132">I would like to refer the Court now to page 14 of the petitioner's brief at which point there is a quotation from the Socony Oil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.329" offset="13132675">The Court there said -- I'm reading from the middle of the quotation on page 14, “There being no defense of assumption of risk where the seaman has without opportunity to use a safe appliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.085" offset="13183666">It seems plain that his choice of a defective instead of a safe one resulting in injury does not differ in either quality of the act or in its injurious consequences in any practical way from his correspondently negligent use of a safe or an unsafe appliance where its use has contributed to an injury resulting from a breach of duty by the owner.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.072" offset="13299649">Now, the petitioner appears to contend and states at point one of his brief that under the Jones Act, there is absolute liability imposed on a shipowner for unsafe working conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.724" offset="13362239">That conclusion directly contradicts the language of the Federal Employers' Liability Act which is set out at page 2 of the respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.411" offset="13401004">That language reads, “Every common carrier by a railroad while engaging in commerce shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce or such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents or employees of such carrier or by a reason of any defect or insufficiency due to its negligence in its cars, engines, appliances, machinery and so forth.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.615" offset="13561814">The conclusion that the petitioner points at point one of his brief is inconsistent with all case law on the point including the authorities that he himself cites apparently in support of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.179" offset="13624090">Now, this appears to be the petitioner's argument as contained at page 9 of his brief, the principal argument upon which the petitioner seems to rely in attempting to reach a conclusion as to the shipowner's absolute liability in Jones Act cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.666" offset="13698069">Petitioner says has the duty, referring to the vessel owner's duty to provide safe appliances and to provide for the seaman a safe place to work as the duty is non-delegable, not discharged by the exercise of due diligence and is a continuing one for the shipowner's actual knowledge or breach of the duty need not be proved for it is always imputed to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.588" offset="13821680">Therefore, the mere breach of the duty satisfies the negligence requirements of the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.351" offset="13860760">Mere breach, I go now to the last sentence of that paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.656" offset="13874030">"Mere breach of the similar duty to provide a safe place to work satisfies the negligence requirements of the Federal Employers' Liability Act where the injury was sustained on a property of another over which the railroad had neither knowledge nor control."</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.988" offset="13959293">I should like to discuss briefly the four decisions which the petitioner cites in that paragraph in apparent support of the argument that I've read.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.920" offset="14007045">First is Pacific American Fisheries against Hoof, petitioner cites that apparently in support of the proposition that shipowner's actual knowledge of the breach of duty need not be proved for it is always imputed to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.394" offset="14072978">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in its opinion in that case made it clear that its decision was based on the general common law principles of constructed knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.739" offset="14118327">The Court of Appeals said, “When the working place and appliances are unsafe, it is no answer to say that they were rendered unsafe at some previous time by the act of another servant."</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.950" offset="14179140">As already stated, the duty is a continuing one and the notice of defects and dangers will be imputed to the master where they could have been discovered by reasonable inspection and by the exercise of reasonable care.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.729" offset="14258239">This Court denied certiorari in the Pacific American Fisheries case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.973" offset="14283316">Second, Frey against the United States also cited by the petitioner in support of the points of that paragraph, in Frey against the United States --</text>

            <text syncTime="3607.728" offset="14534301">I refer to the Pacific American Fisheries case in the opinion of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, in that case as pointing out that the vessel owner is liable only where such defects or such dangers could have been discovered by a reasonable inspection and by the exercise of reasonable care.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.222" offset="14624266">In other words, the Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit refers back to the common law principles of negligence in order to hold a vessel unreliable under the Jones Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3691.982" offset="14871280">I don't know whether it's negligence which apparently from my reading on the briefs seems to be the case in not giving this second baker working on ice cream a bar tool to work with, a multiple-pronged ice pick as it were that he could use to chip off this ice cream that he's described as hard as a brickbat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.666" offset="14966053">And it was incidentally when he described it as hard as a brickbat which apparently nothing can penetrate that he took the knife which he himself described as razor sharp in an attempt to penetrate it.What the -- what the particular negligence is, I do not know, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.544" offset="15049540">Frey against the United States involved that injury to a seaman who slipped in a shower that was improperly constructed and there appear to be no question as to the fact of improper construction.</text>
