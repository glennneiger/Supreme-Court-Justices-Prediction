            <label>Mr. William French Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="11.500" offset="149400">If the Court please, I believe that when we concluded yesterday afternoon that I had stated that this, in our viewpoint, the issue before the Court was simply what is the meaning of the term “establishment” and that was quite divorced from any issue with respect to bigness or littleness, wholesale or retail, or humanitarian considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.552" offset="253576">It's just a very simple question.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.052" offset="259532">What does this one term mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="40.865" offset="266846">Our position, of course, as I stated, is that we feel there are many factors which bear upon this question not the least of which is the customary and ordinary business practice organization and function, and we feel that an establishment must contain at least some organizational, functional and business identity and significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.342" offset="356707">The position of the petitioner, here, is simply as we see it, nothing more that -- than that any separate physical location where work is done constitutes an establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.880" offset="406862">We feel that that is -- is an entirely impracticable test and could not realistically be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.451" offset="433194">And I would like, if I may, to go into that in some detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.428" offset="453047">Take for example a situation where a company may build a 15-story building in which it does its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.327" offset="488678">Another company, instead of having 15 stories, has 15 separate buildings ramps all located on one lot or perhaps gathered above the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.016" offset="523473">It doesn't make much difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.466" offset="529220">In each of those 15 buildings, there, is work being done and each one, of course, is a separate physical location.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.118" offset="555865">Under the position of the petitioner here, that would mean that one company, otherwise, identical would have one establishment under the petitioner's regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.532" offset="597452">The other would have 15 establishments, the sole and only difference being the separate physical location.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.185" offset="624097">Or take another example, we have a welder who has -- who does welding work and sparks why, therefore, we want to put him out in a shed behind the main building or in the next lot or down the street of ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.737" offset="674356">One employee in one shed, separate physical location, the work being done in that shed could have possibly be said that that employee was employed by that shed within the meaning of Section 13 (a) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="150.346" offset="704763">Could have possibly be said that that shed has annual dollar volumes of sales or services?</text>
            <text syncTime="163.076" offset="755649">We submit that Congress could never have intended any such result as that or we can complicate them out a little further to say that one employee works 49% of the time in the shed and 51% of the time in the main building.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.578" offset="809671">Does that affect the status of a shed being an establishment or we have more than one employee in that shed, three or four?Does the average amount of time determine whether or not the shed or the main building is the establishment?</text>
            <text syncTime="188.924" offset="859094">Or we could have a series of, let's say, cold storage warehouses, little places that are located about the city with one employee who goes around and makes daily visits to these various storage warehouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.849" offset="914787">In each case, we have a separate physical location and work being done there as each one a separate establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.961" offset="939238">If it is, to what establishment does that employee belong?</text>
            <text syncTime="212.718" offset="954284">We could carry these illustrations on and on, but I think they are very important because they show what the Courts are going to be faced with from hereon in if this is the kind of a test which is established.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.360" offset="1000782">In addition to Section 13 (a) (2) itself, as providing guideposts to determine this question, we also have some legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.807" offset="1034637">There's a good deal of legislative history, of course, that preceded the 1949 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.577" offset="1053654">There is some with respect to this particular problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.678" offset="1066088">And I would like just, if I may, to read because the quotations can express it a lot better than I can.</text>

            <label>Mr. William French Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="261.689" offset="1150098">24, respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.722" offset="1162219">The Congress used the terms “retail” and “service establishments” in their customary meaning, in their customary application as they were customarily understood in the various industries of the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.064" offset="1211643">That certainly shows that the type of business consideration that I am referring to here was in the minds of Congress when this amendment was passed because I think it would have had to have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.306" offset="1256573">In addition to that, there are indications that simple physical location is not to be a controlling test in the house manager statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.426" offset="1297115">There is an excerpt that which appears on the same page of this brief which says, since however, the exemption does apply to any employee employed by an exempt retail or service establishment, it is applicable to employees of an exempt retail or service establishment working in a warehouse, operated by and servicing such establishment exclusively, whether or not the warehouse operation is conducted in the same building as the selling or servicing activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.088" offset="1403695">Now, I submit that that doesn't require any context in determining its applicability to this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.048" offset="1439535">Even if it did, I don't believe that the context would, at all, change the basic meaning of that quotation.One other thing, which I think is of interest too, and that is that this Court in the Phillips case, in a footnote, referred to the legislative history, originally that is, where it was proposed of the term “industry” be substituted for the term “establishment” really as vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.492" offset="1533367">The original proposal was that instead of having a retail establishment, we have a retail industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.073" offset="1563669">That term was deleted and the establishment was substituted forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.611" offset="1581850">That was pointed out in some length in petitioner's brief before this Court in the Phillips case and as I say it was referred to by the Court in the -- its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.470" offset="1621243">Now, that shows certainly that Congress was thinking about the larger side of the term establishment, not the smaller side.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.862" offset="1654784">They were talking about some -- something, somewhere between industry and the term establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.985" offset="1675264">If Congress had been talking about a building or something as -- something as detailed and small, you might say is that, certainly, Congress would have found some other words to express themselves than it was done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.453" offset="1745168">I think it is also interesting to note that petitioner itself has taken a different position in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.278" offset="1780485">I have already referred to the case of Tobin versus Aibel, where the petitioner took the position of two separate locations constituted at one establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.270" offset="1828446">In that case, under their own order, issue of pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act, they had used the term that there was coverage where goods were partially or completely manufactured in the same establishment because that where the knitting process is performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.393" offset="1900962">There we had a one physical location where these hair nets, or whatever they were, were made another where they were distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.093" offset="1939728">They were two separate legal identities -- entities, I should say.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.181" offset="1952057">One was the corporation, the other, partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.736" offset="1962297">Petitioner, there, took the position that both of those two together should constitute one establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.175" offset="1984031">We agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.747" offset="1986330">That's our position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.901" offset="1990928">We think that in that case, petitioner would have been in a much stronger position to have urged that the one -- one separate physical location constituted the establishment rather than both.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.106" offset="2043800">We suggest that the position that they took there should be applied here.</text>

            <text syncTime="524.987" offset="2203355">And I think -- and I, as a matter of fact, I will very readily admit and be most happy, too, that the Congress during the time of the 1949 amendment were being considered, specifically approved the Phillips case.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.752" offset="2258422">And I think that this particular quotation here, which comes, first talks about regular chain store systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.858" offset="2286843">We make no contention that that quotation is erroneous in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.305" offset="2304606">In other words, we think that what -- what Congress was doing here was to say that what this Court said in Phillips was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.639" offset="2333968">In other words, where you do have a regular chain store situation and I understand the chain store situation to be where you have a series of outlets, retail outlets, but then, in addition to that, you have manufacturing, processing, and distribution functions which they're all funneled, of course, ultimately to those retail outlets.</text>

            <text syncTime="1613.587" offset="6557759">We have to get another building somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.562" offset="6565595">So, we get a building down the street of ways, a block, let's say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.323" offset="6584613">And we store things there and in the storeroom and as things are sold, we go back to the storeroom and to the building down the street, bring them back, put them on the shelves and sell them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.975" offset="6623274">That situation, petitioner does not contend and constitutes two -- two establishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.384" offset="6640933">They say that is one, the Burns case, a Federal District Court case held that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.240" offset="6656293">And as I understand it, both of the trial level and in the -- in their brief here, petitioner concedes that under those circumstances there is just one establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.691" offset="6690147">Now, the only difference between that situation and this situation is that instead of having a backroom and one subsidiary backroom down the street, we have four.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.279" offset="6736436">That is the only difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.677" offset="6742079">We don't have pails, bottles and cans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.788" offset="6750542">We don't have bedroom sets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.592" offset="6757752">And therefore, -- dining room sets and that sort of things was not too surprising that we would need four -- four or five times as much space as a -- as a -- an organization would -- that handles cans and bottles.</text>

            <text syncTime="2432.944" offset="9835186">I probably shouldn't have speculated to withstand.I didn't respect to whether or not at that time they were or not directly having customer contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.637" offset="9865906">I assume when Alameda was put up, that was the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.344" offset="9876773">But there is -- there is this difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.614" offset="9881788">There's a difference between having a building out here where we could take things, too, once we have our customer contacts with Figueroa and actually having a customer contact situation or a retail outlet at that warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.879" offset="9934869">Now, there has never been a retail outlet there while that warehouse has been in the East Los Angeles Division, you see.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.469" offset="9961200">It is just been nothing more than a physical location.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.119" offset="9971858">Now, I -- I suspect that in some cases, it's convenient to have the warehouse where it is, some cases, it's not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.065" offset="9999653">But in any case, we would be tickled to death to have everything just in one building, one place, one unit, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.743" offset="10038314">I think one thing I wanted to point out was the fact that the -- the petitioner in this case, in the Phillips case, the one case that they are -- they are relying upon took the position very strongly that the policy of the-- and -- and I'm quoting from a statement in their brief which appears in one form or another or rather frequently, “The policy of the Act as a whole strongly supports the accepted governmental and business meaning of the words.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.486" offset="10137266">Now, that was their position, their contention with respect to what an establishment meant and that was the position which was adopted by this Court in the Phillips case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.833" offset="10174673">And -- look at this Court in the Phillips case specifically stated Congress used the word establishment as it is normally used in business and in the Government-as meaning a distinct physical place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.978" offset="10231306">Now, it's that phrase which I think has caused the trouble, but that phrase has had its genesis in the regulations of the petitioner itself where they have stated to use their term physically separated unit or a branch in distinguishing a situation between the overall chain store system and its retail outlet.</text>
