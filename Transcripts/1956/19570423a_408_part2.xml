            <text syncTime="6.956" offset="131218">As I said before the recess, this was a suit by the railroad appellees to set aside the order of October 28th, 1955, of the Interstate Commerce Commission, which either itself extended the previously granted temporary authority or recognized that the section 9 (b) in itself acted upon the previously granted temporary authority to extend it.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.937" offset="239156">The position of the railroads was not that the Commission abused this discretion in granting this order of October 28 but that it lacks statutory authority to do the Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. David G. Macdonald</label>
            <text syncTime="156.228" offset="728273">That was the point I was going to make next that while we were the defendants below, because the Court indicated to is prior argument that if this was the same issue presented in the Stone's Express case, we could expect the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.834" offset="782712">We did get the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.238" offset="788355">We lost the case below but two of the three judges in a concurring opinion indicated that were the matter presented for the first time to that court rather than being bound by Stone's Express, they would have viewed it differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.604" offset="849795">As a consequence, we have no decision of -- no independent decision of the lower court in this case to look to for the reasoning supporting the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.447" offset="889187">We have to look to the earlier decision in the Stone's Express case which in effect was adopted by the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.677" offset="926072">The question -- the holding in the -- in the Stone's Express case was at section 9 (b), the third sentence that we're concerned with, did not authorize Interstate Commerce Commission to extend a temporary authority issued under section 210 (a) (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="225.110" offset="1003813">That is a similar but slightly different provision than the one we're dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.147" offset="1020008">Section 210 (a) (b) is a portion of the Motor Carrier Act which authorizes the -- the grant of temporary authority to one carrier to operate the properties of another to preserve those properties from eminent loss during the pendency of an acquisition proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.475" offset="1089285">It's one of the four sections in the Interstate Commerce Act which deal with temporary licenses and I believe it's generally conceded that the decision of this Court will determine the status of all four of those sections rather than just section 311 (a), since they all contain a 180-day limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.773" offset="1166503">The reasoning in -- of the Court in the Stone case was found in two different propositions.And they both have to do with the language of section 9 (b), which I referred you to at page 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.020" offset="1223450">The first point was that the Court found that for 9 (b) to be applicable, the person who was seeking to have a temporary license renewed, would have to have filed an application at the time that it was a licensee.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.616" offset="1313834">This is a very technical point.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.456" offset="1325223">In other words, they said that to get to this case that we have at bar, Pan-Atlantic file its application for temporary authority on or about May 8, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.399" offset="1364929">That on the same day, it filed an application for permanent authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.298" offset="1380603">The temporary authority application was granted on May 18th, 10 days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.424" offset="1401083">Therefore, the application for permanent authority was pending before it became a licensee by reason of receiving the temporary authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.502" offset="1437341">The Court in the Stone's Express case where the similar situation was presented, said that 9 (b) doesn't apply because you have to read it as of the time when the application for a new or renewal license was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.479" offset="1497318">I'll come back to that point in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.400" offset="1504946">The second reason of this Court in the Stone's Express case is more fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.658" offset="1526053">The Court held that section 9 (b) taken as a licensing authority grant to the Interstate Commerce Commission is in conflict with section 311 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="366.567" offset="1569625">And that repeal by implication is not favored.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.837" offset="1586761">In other words, the Court said -- 311 (a) says that you can grant these temporary licenses for a maximum of 180 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.638" offset="1621974">You say under 9 (b) that you've extended this license beyond 180 days, and that 9 (b) gives you authority to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.670" offset="1654053">This is a conflict in terms between these two sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.812" offset="1674637">The Administrative Procedure Act containing section 9 (b) was passed after section 311 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="399.508" offset="1701386">Therefore, we say we resolve the conflict in favor of the earlier statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.658" offset="1730017">Our position on these points, and these were the only two points which were the underlying reasons why the Court in the Stone's Express case held the way it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.923" offset="1771081">Is it a license holder -- the -- as to the first point, that the license holder must be a license holder not when the application for renewal or a new license is filed, but in accordance with agency rules, it must be one before the expiration of the license.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.282" offset="1840462">And our reasoning depends primarily just on the language of the section.</text>

            <text syncTime="464.359" offset="1960835">The -- the section 9 (b), under which the temporary authority was extended, provides that in any -- and I'm quoting, "In any case in which the licensee has, in accordance with agency rules, made timely and sufficient application for a renewal or a new license, no license with reference to any activity of a continuing nature shall expire until such application shall have been finally determined by the agency.”</text>
            <text syncTime="493.275" offset="2076505">The Court in the Stone's Express case, looking at that language said this, “The third sentence of section 9 (b), however, in using the words, “In any case in which the licensee has made timely and sufficient application for a renewal or a new license.”</text>
            <text syncTime="515.467" offset="2165217">Indicates that the statute presupposes at the time of the filing of the application the existence of the license."</text>

            <text syncTime="3018.941" offset="12179101">The United States supports the judgment of the District Court because it believes that section 9 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act does not supersede or repeal the time limit which is incorporated in Section 311 (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.661" offset="12257991">Now, 311 (a) is a part of the Water Carrier Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.006" offset="12275440">And its relation to the regulatory scheme of that Act is of some importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.023" offset="12311489">The Act makes it unlawful to operate as a common carrier by water unless the carrier has a certificate of public convenience in necessity issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.707" offset="12366242">As to operations which are -- were being carried on before the Act was passed, the Commission is directed to issue a certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.187" offset="12404172">But as to any certificate other than one covering these so-called grandfather rights, certain steps have to be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.058" offset="12443564">It's necessary to file a sworn application and give notice to interested parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.512" offset="12469373">There was then a hearing at which opponents may be heard, and present evidence, and argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.693" offset="12498108">Finally, the Commission may issue a certificate only if it finds on the text developed at the hearing that the proposed service is or will be required by public convenience or necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.068" offset="12559653">The certificate specifies that we had a routes to be operated and once the certificate is issued this is permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.380" offset="12592880">The Commission has not power to revoke it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.504" offset="12605419">That was held in the Seatrain case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.541" offset="12617540">Now, the statute, therefore, provides for exercise of control over entry into the business of coastal or inland water carrier operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.825" offset="12674696">This is a provision which safeguards against slicing the traffic quite too thin in particular areas of types of operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.049" offset="12727568">It also gives the Commission power to select the best qualified where there are several applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.152" offset="12755989">Now, the one circumstance in which a certificate is not required is where there is a grant of temporary operating authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.854" offset="12786813">And this is to be granted where service should be provided to meet an urgent and immediate need.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.522" offset="12829445">The Commission may grant this authority, if it meets the words of the section in its discretion and without hearings or other proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.312" offset="12864658">And the grant shall be valid for not more than 180 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.408" offset="12889004">Now, these temporary grants are breached in the scheme for control over entry into the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.042" offset="12923591">They do not have to meet the broad test of public convenience and necessity determined after hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.312" offset="12956609">They essentially provide for some reaction on an ex parte showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.414" offset="12976985">Now, it's true that the Commission gives notice to some carriers who may think are affected and they are permitted to file written statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.397" offset="13020975">But the action is essentially summary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.498" offset="13037380">Congress gave this open hand to the Commission in granting these authorities, but at the same time as the counterbalance, it fixed a definite time limit on their duration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.611" offset="13093804">And legislative history shows that this was not an over sight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.627" offset="13109896">That it was designed and purposeful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.229" offset="13128286">It has been mentioned that 311 (a) is derived from section 210 (a), which was added to the Motor Carrier Act in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.122" offset="13171858">In fact, the two sections are verbatim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.686" offset="13186069">The Commission recommended adoption of 210 (a) and alerted Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.581" offset="13217729">It took notice of the fact in this letter that the absolute discretion, which was being given to the Commission, would mean that care would have to used to protect the legitimate interest of other carriers and that power of this kind, it said, could be abused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.161" offset="13304038">It then says, "but in event the grant would be strictly limited in time", after suggesting that the Commission was not likely to use this power inappropriately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.358" offset="13360776">So, the strict time limitation was put before Congress as a factor which might mitigate against abuses possibly developing in administration of power which was entirely discretionary.</text>

            <text syncTime="5041.288" offset="20268492">At the outset, in our discussion of this matter, I should like to make sure that the Court and I have in mind the same basic facts in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5056.063" offset="20327633">There were two material applications filed before the administrative agency involved here, the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5065.486" offset="20365354">The first one was filed May 5th, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="5070.811" offset="20386565">It sought a so-called temporary authority from the Commission and was addressed to the Commission's power to grant such relief under section 311 (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5083.421" offset="20437034">It is useful and I respectfully suggest important to bear in mind the language of section 311 (a) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5091.558" offset="20469635">It empowers the Commission to grant such temporary authority without -- without hearings or other proceedings, in the event that there is an urgent and immediate need for the service thus to be rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="5107.884" offset="20534941">Approximately three days later, as Mr. Macdonald has advised the Court, although it is not a matter of record, I believe that it's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5116.617" offset="20569840">Approximately three days later on May 8th, Pan-Atlantic, the applicant carrier before the Commission filed another application for Commission relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5127.953" offset="20615189">This was for a so-called permanent intercoastal certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5133.322" offset="20636609">The same type of carriage sought to be authorized by the prior application for a temporary certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5141.433" offset="20669106">However, there was an important, a very important distinction between these two applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="5148.151" offset="20695960">The first one as I have said was addressed to the Commission's power under section 311 (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5157.425" offset="20733053">The second one was addressed to the Commission's power under section 309 of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5165.269" offset="20764400">Those sections differed in respects that are important to the decision now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5172.413" offset="20793031">Section 309 empowered the Interstate Commerce Commission to issue a license or a certificate which is permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5180.925" offset="20827094">It's permanent in the sense that this Court has held in the Seatrain case, Seatrain against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5187.471" offset="20853217">That it is, at least, in some circumstances, any way beyond the power of the Commission to revoke that certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5194.676" offset="20882056">It is, I think, true without a doubt in the whole wide world that the Commission has every power in the world to revoke a temporary certificate which is issuable entirely within the Commission's discretion under section 311 (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5211.614" offset="20949870">Therefore, the first important difference between these two applications and the two types of relief sought from the Commission to be noted is the permanent and the irrevocable nature of the second certificate sought on May 8th, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="5227.328" offset="21012668">And the temporary, and I contend, revocable nature of the certificate sought -- the license sought and granted by the application of May 5th.</text>

            <text syncTime="5303.574" offset="21317674">Now, the next event that occurred, which is of importance after the May 8th application for permanent certificate, was an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission granting the temporary certificate sought on -- on May 18th, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="5324.542" offset="21401579">Some 13 days -- some 13 days after the application for temporary authority had been filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="5344.950" offset="21483186">It was a grant of intercoastal authority for the six-month period contemplated by section 311 (a) of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="5766.940" offset="23171114">The Court will note that the Civil Aeronautics Board thinks of a renewal application to which section 9 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act is applicable to be an application for a subsequent exemption license under section 416 (b), I believe it is, of the Civil Aeronautics Act and does not think of the so-called renewal application as being an application for a permanent certificate under the Civil Aeronautics Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5795.988" offset="23287306">No more in the case at bar should section 9 (b) be, be thought of as relevant to an application for a permanent certificate.</text>

            <text syncTime="5963.211" offset="23956250">We do urge it because that is the only construction of Section 9 (b) which makes sense in the light of the practical realities of the situation concerning which the Chief Justice questioned counsel just now.</text>

            <text syncTime="5982.124" offset="24031901">The underlying statutory purpose which is involved here, it expressed not in section 9 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act or indeed in section 311 (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5996.605" offset="24089788">I suggest that it is to be found in section 309 of the Interstate Commerce Act, which includes the words, "No carrier shall engage in transportation subject to this part."</text>
            <text syncTime="6009.734" offset="24142346">Those are the words which are customarily used in beginning a licensing enabling statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6016.979" offset="24171290">In other words, the legislature creates an area of prohibition and then empowers an agency to lift that prohibition by granting a privilege to a licensee to act within that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6030.476" offset="24225311">Now, often the standards which are required of licensees in these licensing enabling situations are simply standards of fitness.</text>
            <text syncTime="6041.527" offset="24269511">You don't like an optometrist, or a doctor, or a dentist operating in your town if you -- if he isn't reasonably confident.</text>
            <text syncTime="6049.627" offset="24301902">That's not the sole standard required of a licensee under the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6058.310" offset="24336593">In order to understand this, at least let me tell the Court that in order for me to understand this, it was helpful for me to remember that the Interstate Commerce Act requires the transportation industry to depart from the principles, and functions, and effects at least partially, of the free market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6080.590" offset="24425723">The function of a free market with regard to any nterprise is to keep inefficient enterprises from entering into the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6089.506" offset="24461354">And to some extent to winnow out enterprises when they become inefficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="6094.997" offset="24483401">And finally to discourage anybody, inefficient or efficient, from entering into an overcrowded market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6103.524" offset="24517465">And this is, of course, a very good thing because it is wasteful of national income, should anybody enter into an overcrowded market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6112.003" offset="24551424">By an overcrowded market I mean, of course, a market where there are already more than -- than enough people to take care of all the business available.</text>
            <text syncTime="6121.330" offset="24588727">We have in this country with regard to the transportation industry, at least the rail motor carrier and water carrier transportation industry, departed from the regulatory function of that free market and we have assigned that regulatory function to the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="6138.387" offset="24656959">Section 309 posits another requirement besides fitness for a licensee to get a license, and that is, that the service sought to be provided be required by the public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="6152.425" offset="24713070">A clue to what is meant by public convenience and necessity can be found in a statement of the National Transportation Policy, which begins the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6162.669" offset="24754030">And if we were to take the time which is not, unfortunately, available to be anymore today to compare what I have just suggested are the functions of the free market and to compare the criteria set up for the Interstate Commerce Commission in exercising its licensing function, we would find a very, in my view anyway, happy coincidence between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="6183.627" offset="24837831">The Interstate Commerce Commission in short has the function of regulating the transportation industry market so that inefficient industries don't enter it.</text>

            <text syncTime="6213.129" offset="24955904">If the Interstate Commerce Commission is to perform this guiding function i lieu of the free market, it must obtain information concerning what the conditions are in the industry which it regulates.</text>

            <text syncTime="6235.081" offset="25043675">It must find out what the cost of capital is at a given time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6238.104" offset="25055796">It must find out how readily people already in the transportation market can expand their enterprises to meet new and growing needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="6246.070" offset="25087666">Therefore, when someone comes to the Interstate Commerce Commission and asks permission to violate the prohibition in section 309, namely, that no one shall engage in transportation subject to this part ask, therefore, privilege to enter into the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6261.639" offset="25149942">The Commission must find out what the conditions are in the market in order to make sure that its entry there will not create a great deal of damage.</text>

            <text syncTime="6818.079" offset="27375679">I'd like to answer a few of the questions that have been put by Members of the Court.First of all, Mr. Justice Black asked what are the practicalities of this situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="6827.157" offset="27412041">What is the effect of our decision one way or the other?</text>
            <text syncTime="6830.751" offset="27426356">I think it should be clear to the Court, now, that the real problem here or the real controversy is -- is a controversy between the railroads, which desire to have a freedom from competition by a water carrier line and the -- on the one hand, and on the other hand, the combined interests of the water carrier line and the public which it serves.</text>
            <text syncTime="6853.312" offset="27516635">I think it's an interesting commentary on that controversy to realize that in connection with these permanent authorities issued under section 309, referred to by Mr. Keenan, that the railroad opposition is a meaningless factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="6866.680" offset="27570134">I should like to call the Court's attention in the case of A.L.Mechling Barge Lines Inc., ext.Tampa, 285 I.C.C.743 and Weyerhaeusers Steamship Company, ext.Port Everglades, which is Doc.No.W417 sub.(1), dated November 15, 1956 not reported, which illustrate the principle that they are both from the Commission's decision in the latter case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6896.275" offset="27688521">However, notwithstanding, a service by rail, we have repeatedly found that shippers in communities are entitled to adequate transportation service by water with its inherent benefits and advantages upon proof of a need, therefore, as well as by a rail.</text>
            <text syncTime="6910.493" offset="27745364">In other words, this is an interest on the part of the railroads to take advantage of a technicality to cause a water carrier service to be discontinued.</text>
            <text syncTime="6920.648" offset="27786010">Now, what was the basis upon which it was initiated?</text>
            <text syncTime="6923.518" offset="27797400">311 (a) permits the Commission to initiate that service only on a finding that there's an urgent and immediate need and no other carrier services can meet them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6933.296" offset="27836583">And that includes rail service.</text>
            <text syncTime="6935.156" offset="27844002">It has to be another water carrier service before the Commission can deny that.</text>
