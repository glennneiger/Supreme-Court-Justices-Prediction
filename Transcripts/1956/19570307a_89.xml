            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 89, Automobile Club of Michigan, Petitioner, versus Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.454" offset="137174">Mr. Stull, you may proceed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_n_stull" startTime="17.451" stopTime="805.356">
            <label>Mr. John N. Stull</label>
            <text syncTime="17.451" offset="173223">If the Court please, I would like to take a moment to very briefly summarize the Government's position as presented yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.552" offset="205615">We are saying first with regard to this ruling question that there was not a retroactive revocation here that the taxpayer had noticed of the change in the revenue services position in the 1943 ruling and that owners of individual rulings cannot be expected in every occasion to have individual notification of a revocation of a ruling that has generally published.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.582" offset="325674">To do so, it would put too much of a burden on the administration of the revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.665" offset="346049">Furthermore in this case, it seems to us that the taxpayer is asking that others similarly situated whom revenue had the personnel to get around to prior to the time of getting around to this one had to pay back the 1943 as well as we're asking in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.271" offset="432462">We have not been able to see that they -- that this taxpayer is being discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.712" offset="454196">We have not been able to see that there is any detriment.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.364" offset="468825">No showing has been made by the taxpayer in this case of any detriment at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.074" offset="491708">Furthermore, we say that under the Internal Revenue Code, a retroactive revocation of a ruling is allowed that it is clear from the legislative history of the 1921 Act, that the reason for putting that provision in the statute was that the tax collector without it has no power to waive a tax and if he has made a mistake and subsequently retrofires that mistake, he has to go back and collect all taxes retroactively which are not barred by the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.525" offset="637471">And it was that particular situation which was met by the statutory provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.767" offset="674461">This Court has considered this particular section of the Internal Revenue Code on one prior occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.785" offset="702464">That was in the Reynolds Tobacco Company case.Bear under the very broad provisions of Section 22 (a) which you will recall defines income as gains, profits and income.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.264" offset="760456">The Commissioner issued a regulation that the sale and purchase of stock of its own stock by a corporation is a capital transaction and does not result in gain or loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.621" offset="825866">Subsequently, that regulation was amended to say that under certain circumstances, it would result in gain or loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.003" offset="863378">The tax -- the Commissioner attempted to apply that -- that ruling, the new regulation retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.368" offset="900890">This Court, in its decision, recognized the power of the Commissioner under the statute to correct erroneous regulations with retroactive effect unless there was good reason that such alteration must operate prospectively only.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.951" offset="979153">In that case, a good reason was found by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.474" offset="993259">They said that this regulation had been outstanding for a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.220" offset="1012276">Congress had passed successive Revenue Acts and was presumed to have given at the step of law and that the Commissioner did not have any discretion to revoke retroactively what it was in effect a provision of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.265" offset="1076433">We say that that does not apply in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.235" offset="1092315">In the first place, this taxpayer argues that it was acting under an individual unpublished ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.065" offset="1123662">We do not think that Congress can certainly be presumed to have known of the existence of this individual unpublished ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.008" offset="1159398">Furthermore, there are regulations outstanding under this particular section of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.606" offset="1189804">These regulations merely require that anyone who wants to -- who says that they're exempt should come in and try to prove to the Commissioner that they are exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.432" offset="1237138">If he -- if the taxpayer is able to prove exemption under the regulations, then the Commissioner isn't going to bother him anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.572" offset="1277680">There is a 1935 decision, the Board of Tax Appeals, in which an organization was held exempt even though it never went in and requested the Commissioner to give it a ruling with exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.158" offset="1332015">They said that the -- only, the worst that could happened for failure to comply with those regulations was that a litigation would result that the Commissioner could resist it.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.377" offset="1380916">The Commissioner acquiesced in that decision and has followed it ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.013" offset="1399411">Therefore, we don't believe that there is any outstanding regulation or rule which ever said that this taxpayer was exempt and that Congress knew about.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.695" offset="1462105">Now, this regulation does say in one part that if you comply with these particular rules, you don't have to file a return.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.717" offset="1502229">Well, the taxpayer may say, and that's the next point in the argument, that he relied on that and did not file a return.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.972" offset="1539218">Well, we don't see how that could be true in this case in view of the 1943 published ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.199" offset="1568162">After all, that was noticed generally published for all the world to see.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.488" offset="1589373">Now, taxpayer seems to hint rather darkly that the Commissioner cannot be trusted with discretion under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.823" offset="1626676">Well, that seems to be right in the face of the statute which Congress has enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.413" offset="1649037">It seems to us that if Congress was afraid that the Commissioner would abuse his discretion that it would have put the brakes on it but it hasn't done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.158" offset="1688012">It has in effect expanded that particular provision every time it's come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.234" offset="1720299">There is another question as to this retroactive revocation and that has to do with the running of the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.998" offset="1759378">The law says that the statute of -- that the Commissioner can assess the deficiency in tax within three years only, within three years from the time the return is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.194" offset="1812146">And another section of the Code says that if no return was filed, there is no statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.989" offset="1859375">The taxpayer here admits that he never filed a tax return, but he does say that the mere fact that he was excused from filing a tax return was enough to start the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.004" offset="1919352">His authority on this seems to be a decision of the Second Circuit, the Balkan National Insurance Company case, in which the -- all the books and records of a corporation was seized by the alien property custodian.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.553" offset="1973582">The alien property custodian did make some sort of a return but it wasn't signed and didn't really constitute a return.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.565" offset="2001586">An enterprising revenue agent, some years later, said that that wasn't a return and assessed the deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.248" offset="2036381">The Second Circuit held in that case that after all the Commissioner by his own action had prevented filing of a return of this taxpayer or rather the Government had and then another branch of the Government could not take advantage of such action.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.504" offset="2097403">Here, we say that that -- they were never presented from filing a return as in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.112" offset="2127809">There is one further point on this and that is that during the years in question, certain information returns were filed by the taxpayer in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.227" offset="2168247">These are Form 990 and do not, in anyway, represent or resemble the regular corporation income tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.177" offset="2208057">Now, in order to understand exactly what was the reason behind the requirement of filing this return, we have to go back to the legislative history of the 1943 Act when it was put in.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.275" offset="2252466">At that time, Congress was becoming very concerned about charities, which were operating business in competition with regular taxpaying organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.427" offset="2297083">They were also concerned with so-called theatre-corporations where they earn a spaghetti business or some other business and all their profits go to a charity because all their stock is owned by it and they say they're exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.675" offset="2346088">Congress in 1943 wanted to do something about that but they said that we are in possession of sufficient information to be able to act intelligently on this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.396" offset="2388929">So therefore, they directed the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to require organizations which have been given exemption to file certain information in order to allow a study of the problem to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.514" offset="2453400">This, in other words, was merely for information gathering purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.842" offset="2470745">It was not for tax collection purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.431" offset="2485060">I think possibly the distinction can be brought out by two decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.753" offset="2506376">The first one was in the Germantown Trust Company case.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.120" offset="2519855">There, the trust company put a lot of small trust funds together in order to make more efficient operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.079" offset="2551724">They filed a fiduciary income tax return on which they listed all the income, all the deductions and all the people who are interested in this fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.883" offset="2602924">They filed this fiduciary return and they later on a revenue agent came around and said, “You are taxable as a corporation not as a trust, therefore, you filed the wrong return and the statute has not started.”</text>
            <text syncTime="638.965" offset="2659244">This Court in that case said, “You, the Commissioner, were in possession of sufficient facts to know how to compute that tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.898" offset="2691009">What more do you want?”</text>
            <text syncTime="648.423" offset="2697070">And said that started the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.011" offset="2707414">Then, the Lane-Wells case came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.636" offset="2717968">In that case, Congress had levied a very steep surtax on personal holding companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.220" offset="2744299">The Commissioner said that on his regular Form 1120 corporation income tax return put a question, “Are you a personal holding company?”</text>
            <text syncTime="669.610" offset="2781811">If so, file Form 1120 (h) which requested further information.”</text>
            <text syncTime="675.956" offset="2807202">In the Lane-Wells case, taxpayer said no to that, he is not a personal holding company and did not file Form 1120 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="685.226" offset="2844296">After the three-year period had expired, the Commissioner assessed the deficiency for the personal holding company tax and this Court said that was correct that -- that return on 1120 had not started the statute of limitations running, that the Commissioner was perfectly within his rights in requiring that information on Form 1120 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="708.265" offset="2936456">And since he was not in possession of sufficient information to compute the tax, the statute of limitations had not started.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.242" offset="2976371">It was made -- the argument was made in the -- in the Lane-Wells case but this Court did not agree with it that the Commissioner could have required that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.341" offset="3020779">On the Form 1120 (h) and not necessarily require another return, but this Court said that availed him nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.905" offset="3050977">Now, on this Form 990, there is not sufficient information to compute the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.904" offset="3075009">For example, these are excess profits tax here that we're talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.789" offset="3094549">An excess profit tax depends upon and involved average base period net income credit or a historical invested capital credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.720" offset="3134255">There is no information as to any of that on these returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.581" offset="3149720">Furthermore, the Commissioner could not even have computed the income tax because under World War II excess profits tax, there was, what was known as the two-basket approach, that is that you had to compute income subject to excess profits tax first which was income done in a certain prescribed way minus the credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.386" offset="3236968">Then, that income was not subject to the income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.412" offset="3253060">In other words, you could not compute the income tax unless you knew the -- what the income subject to excess profits tax was.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.532" offset="3281481">We say that nowhere at no time were we in possession of sufficient information to start this to -- in order to compute that tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.342" offset="3324740">Now --</text>

            <text syncTime="978.752" offset="4018343">Well, I would hope that this Court would step in that situation, Your Honor, if Congress didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.714" offset="4058258">One final point on this business of the statute starting the other information returns starting the statute of limitations running, that is that in 1950, Congress as a result of these studies, which was started with the filing of the information returns in 1943, did enact very elaborate provisions as to taxing, what they call unrelated business and net income by these charities and business and also taxing theatre-organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.200" offset="4200155">In that particular year, they said that the information return would start the statute of limitations running for any organization which would be exempt or if not, for the fact that it was engaged in a business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.536" offset="4269537">In other words, they seem to recognize that that return was not going to start the statute and they also seem to say, “We're going to take care of this people but we're not going to take care of the rest of it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.511" offset="4313422">It wasn't until the 1954 Code that they were taken care of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.090" offset="4327737">Now, taxpayer here cannot come in under that 1950 amendment for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.800" offset="4350621">One is that he's not engaged in business and the other is that it applied -- it did not apply to -- as deficiencies which had been asserted prior to September 20, 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.258" offset="4400358">And the Commissioner had asserted the deficiency here sometime, I think, it was in January or February of 1950 and anyway -- and anyway, it was before that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.266" offset="4436407">So it seems to us that Congress has recognized this problem and if there's any equity in the situation, they had certainly rectified it in the 1954 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.883" offset="4482905">The final problem we have here is this problem with prepaid income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.214" offset="4520208">It's -- the old question which many phases of which had been before this Court on previous times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.144" offset="4551973">It's a question of tax accounting versus commercial accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.029" offset="4571512">The Commissioner says, “The taxpayer's particular method here is not allowed under the revenue laws.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.914" offset="4595022">The taxpayer said -- says that my method clearly reflects income, so therefore, it is allowed under the revenue laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.059" offset="4627623">If I may make an illustration of it, suppose the duties here are $12, an individual becomes a member of this organization on October 1, 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.059" offset="4679659">He pays his $12.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.703" offset="4686137">He is entitled to receive the services of the organization for the next 12 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.508" offset="4709439">Taxpayer says that actually the cost of those services is going to be incurred over the next 12 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.055" offset="4735561">So therefore, what he would do in the situation is to take $3 in the income for 1950, $1 for October, $1 for November and $1 for December.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.235" offset="4780283">That is all he paid the tax on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.880" offset="4786866">The rest of it would be apparently shown on the balance sheet as a differed liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.139" offset="4807973">Now, this is in the face of the fact that he has all this cash on hand, he has it in the bank account and he can use it for any purpose allowed by the charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.866" offset="4854888">The $9 that's left over, he says, is not taxable until the following year because that is the year in which the services will be rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.927" offset="4895117">I understand that the same -- almost the same thing to be accomplish by a reserve for estimated expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.601" offset="4921762">In other words, if they have a pretty good idea that if the $12 they take in, it will cost him $10 to service all this particular member.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.716" offset="4954258">They could deduct the reserve under commercial accounting system of $10 so that they would only be taxed on $2 in that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.874" offset="4990830">Reserves -- there were few reserves allowed by the revenue laws but such as reserve for depreciation, depletion, pay debts and so on but no reserve for estimated expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.045" offset="5043597">And I doubt that taxpayer would be here if he had handled it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.168" offset="5064077">Now, I don't want to get into a discussion of a proper method of handling this under commercial accounting because I do not think that we're concerned here with the computation of net profit under commercial accounting standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.625" offset="5129906">We are here concerned with the computation of net income under the Internal Revenue Code, but I do question whether even under a commercial accounting principles, this particular method clearly reflects income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.111" offset="5187793">Can you say when somebody comes in on October and pays his dues for the next 12 months that he is going to require one-twelfth of the services for which he is entitled each month?</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.868" offset="5242859">What if he goes to a hospital?</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.154" offset="5251950">It may be a small point and I'm sure there isn't very much involved but I am ought to know what they would do with the case of a life member.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.279" offset="5288521">For $250, you can become a life member in this organization and you're excused from paying dues for the rest of your life and you're entitled to services for the rest of your life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.860" offset="5326764">I suppose they would find some way of prorating that over your life expectancy in accordance with actuarial tables.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.243" offset="5356335">At any event, under the internal revenue laws, we are concerned mostly with an annual accounting period at the end of every annual accounting period you have to -- you have to compute your tax and find out what your income is, what your deductions are as of that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.652" offset="5433971">There are very few exceptions to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.988" offset="5443375">There, of course, is the net operating loss carry-forward and carry-back which is an exception to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.656" offset="5465945">There is an exception of completed contract basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.768" offset="5478484">There are other -- few other exceptions in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.092" offset="5491754">But nevertheless, outside of those few specific exceptions is an annual accounting period not a transactional basis as this taxpayer is contending.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.425" offset="5533027">Now, I think that our whole argument here stems from a decision of this Court in 1932, North American Oil Consolidated Company case, in which this Court said that if a taxpayer receives earnings under a claim of right without restriction as to disposition, he has received income even though in a later year, he may have to return it or it may have to be given back or spend it for some other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.703" offset="5654235">This here -- this income here or these earnings, these dues here are received with no restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.070" offset="5683702">There is no trust fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.167" offset="5688090">They were not segregated in the bank account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.434" offset="5697076">They could be used at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.247" offset="5704391">We think that this case falls exactly under the North American case which was reaffirmed in 1951 by this Court and the Lewis case in which they said that the claim of right interpretation of the tax laws has long been used to give finality to the accounting period that is now deeply rooted in the federal tax system, but this taxpayer in this -- in our particular case, we're in the accrual basis and it doesn't apply to us because we are in the accrual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.085" offset="5835734">I think that a reading of the North American Oil Consolidated case shows that in that case, the Board of Tax Appeals went off on an erroneous tangent in -- when it had the case before it and never did make a finding as to whether the taxpayer there was on the cash or the accrual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.025" offset="5915460">This Court in deciding the case said that regardless of what basis the taxpayer was on, if these earnings are received under a claim of right without restriction as to disposition, they are taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.312" offset="5992573">Now, I don't think that ordinarily under the -- these cases under the 1939 Code, we should pay any attention at all to the 1954 Code because we've been told by the Committee that we're not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.929" offset="6043042">But I think that it's interesting and important to know what the 1954 Code did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.106" offset="6067806">The 1954 Code had provisions in its Sections 452 and 462, one of which provided for deferral of prepaid income exactly what taxpayer is claiming here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.396" offset="6128933">The other section provided for a reserve for estimated expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.351" offset="6152756">The difficulty with those sections was that the transitional period would have been so expensive that it would have practically wreck the economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.064" offset="6195597">And when that was brought to the attention of the Congress by the Treasury, they realized that it couldn't be afforded, so they revote those two sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.089" offset="6239692">Now, those two sections provided very restrictive provisions as to deferral prepaid income and reserves for estimated expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.313" offset="6280652">They did not purport to (Inaudible) commercial accounting with tax accounting as taxpayer claims here should be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.242" offset="6320358">They realized that it just couldn't be done, so actually what it was, was sort of a compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.371" offset="6344808">For instance, if I saw a refrigerator for $200 and I give a ten-year guarantee with that refrigerator for which I charged $10, under the deferred income of the 1954 Code even though I had to do those -- do the repairs and so on over a period of ten years, you could not differ it for more than six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.353" offset="6448776">That was the longest that it could be differed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.246" offset="6456404">In other words, Congress knew that they weren't taking care of the entire problem but they were doing the best they could in a very restricted way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.944" offset="6491199">Now, what this taxpayer is asking this Court to do in this case is to put its blessing upon a method of handling prepaid income which will have none of those restrictions on, which Congress saw fit to put on them and thought were necessary in this -- since repealed legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.445" offset="6569148">In other words, I guess that would allow commercial accountants to go wild.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.036" offset="6595480">They would be able to use any of their rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.762" offset="6614392">I don't think that that is what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.718" offset="6626200">Now, what Congress did say when it repealed the law is that something should be done of that in this situation that it's just isn't fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.304" offset="6660577">And so they said, “We're going to study the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.634" offset="6669876">We're going to find a way around this particular question of transition which will cost the Government so much money, it can't be afforded and we're going to study it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.999" offset="6711359">Now, I understand that no subcommittee is studying at the moment, but I don't know of any legislation which they've been able to come up with at the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.022" offset="6743437">But we do think it's a problem entirely for legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1673.671" offset="6798085">The Congress come through with legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.908" offset="6806967">If they come through with legislation, that's retroactive to 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.371" offset="6820864">I doubt if it would be retroactive if it were passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.926" offset="6831104">If they passed it this year, we'll probably start for all years beginning at 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.468" offset="6865272">Now, taxpayer also relies on this -- in this case on a case called the Beacon Publishing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.181" offset="6904142">In that case, the Circuit Court put its blessing on this method of differing income and said that the North American Oil Consolidated case and subsequent decisions of this Court were distinguishable and the Beacon case also did something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.863" offset="6974777">That is they said that if a taxpayer who had been reporting on the basis of tax accounting under the North American Oil decision of this Court wish to change to this deferral method that he could do it in that case because said the Court that is merely the correction of an erroneous method of accounting of -- of an error made in his computation of taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.375" offset="7084910">It's not a change in method of accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.610" offset="7097762">Now, counsel for the taxpayer here said yesterday in oral argument that in the committee reports on the repeal of this 1954 Code amendment, that it was indicated that Beacon would be accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.970" offset="7167248">I don't think he could mean that because if it was indicated there that Beacon would be accepted on both counts, then they're saying the economy can't afford our particular methods of deferring income but we're putting our blessing on a case which does even worst, goes even further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.148" offset="7239973">So I don't think that there's any possibility of saying that Beacon was accepted and there's a letter of the Secretary of the Treasury which was -- well, which is placed in the committee report in connection with that repeal, in which it says that the repeal of Section 452, and this was an order to give assurance to the Committee, will not be considered by the Department, the Treasury Department, as either acceptance or rejection by Congress of Beacon or any other judicial decisions outstanding at this time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1830.494" offset="7425337">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.035" offset="7447489">I'm indebted to counsel before the Government in his very clear statement of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.874" offset="7470895">And if I may say so in his very clear statement of our position, I will take up to rebuttal in the order in which he has discussed the issues this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.595" offset="7529723">First, he says various power to revoke retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.635" offset="7561906">Mr. Justice Black in the bench yesterday asked me how a Commission having done wrong to be prevented from correcting his mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.959" offset="7615195">I interrupted to explain and I think the counsel for the Government had done a better job than I, that it is only when the Commissioner is wrong that the doctrine adopted by this Court in Reynolds has any conceivable application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.810" offset="7690637">If the Commissioner is right, we don't have to worry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.597" offset="7717804">Now, I respectfully call your attention to the second stock dividend case, United States against (Inaudible), in which Justice Jackson gives a most worded exposition of the power to revoke retroactively to change your mind retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.117" offset="7815816">And fortunately, he also gives a very detailed history of the section upon which the Government relies, Section 3971 (b), sustaining power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.490" offset="7885302">Justice Jackson says specifically, as I said yesterday, that that section gives no power to revoke retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.732" offset="7938278">The power must first exist before that section applies and the power in this case just as in length does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.825" offset="8010689">I think I need to discuss those cases no further beyond saying that in our opinion, there is no power anywhere found in the statute, in the regulations, and I trust in practice, under which the Commissioner can revoke retroactively in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.887" offset="8114970">Now, counsel for the Government makes a great point about this general counsel's memorandum published in 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.776" offset="8138480">I suspect if he was going to do that, then for your convenience, I put the general counsel's memorandum in the appendix to our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.533" offset="8169514">If you should read it, you will find not the slightest indication of the revocation of the ruling in -- in Individual Automobile Club case, you will find not the slightest indication as to retroactive revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.181" offset="8244120">I think counsel for the Government made a mistake when he said that general counsel's memorandum stated in 1943 that the Commissioner could go back at anytime to 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.036" offset="8315486">His argument is that the Commissioner by reason of the publication of that GCM could any grant in the future and go back to 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.716" offset="8358222">Now, the counsel for the Government, you'll find it somewhat from the record yesterday so I made inquiry of the record, he suggested that the Toy Automobile Club had notice by reason of the fact that whether the members was on the board or if it took place, the organization to which their GCM applied in 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.630" offset="8437844">I'm advised that they received no notice at all of the GCM or the possible application of the revocation of any ruling that we somewhat point up in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.355" offset="8488835">First, and we quote this in our reply brief, “The document itself in which their GCM is published says to the world, this GCM merely evidences the trend of administrative decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.330" offset="8572740">And bear in mind, it is only an opinion from the General Counsel of the Bureau to the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.444" offset="8597191">And any number of instances, day in, day out where the Commissioner does not follow the General Counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.505" offset="8637419">Second, I think perhaps you have at least accomplished two things in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.212" offset="8680260">In 1954, the Commissioner published a ruling stating that from now on general counsel's memorandum published in his bulletin will be noticed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.775" offset="8742431">There is nothing prior to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.562" offset="8753612">And as this Court knows, the only publication, which gives official notice is a better register.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.485" offset="8797288">And if you will read the 1954 revenue ruling, you will find also it says, I think the Commissioner is alarmed by this case, attempted to quiet the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.251" offset="8860400">He says, “It is the specific policy of the bureau except in extraordinary cases not to revoke a ruling retroactively.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.382" offset="8916929">Now, if Your Honors please, that has been the policy of the bureau for years and years and years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.106" offset="8931767">We rely on that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.128" offset="8939917">Taxpayers rely on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.255" offset="8948381">Practitioners rely on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.518" offset="8953396">Accountants rely on it and the Commissioner can well be proud of that policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2293.855" offset="9278777">While the cases, let me say since 1939 and since Reynolds, it is the established policy of the Bureau of Internal Revenue so far as I know never to revoke a ruling retroactively.</text>

            <text syncTime="2437.076" offset="9851695">So that it isn't quite so clear that this is merely a mistake in the interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.603" offset="9885759">Now, let me come to the statute of limitations very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.120" offset="9903835">The Government asked you to disregard the decisions of the Tenth Circuit, the Sixth Circuit, the Second Circuit, take back the Second Circuit and the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.310" offset="9948662">Involving, the Second Circuit held specifically that the action of the Government justified that they need a file to return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.381" offset="10000906">The Court of Appeals held specifically that the statement of a revenue agent that no return would be required to get tax purposes where sufficient justification for no gift tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.615" offset="10065795">They asked you to disregard those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.899" offset="10078960">And if I read the decision correctly, they asked you to overrule the Germantown Trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.562" offset="10101635">After all, if we're going to be accurate on this thing, Germantown Trust should have filed a corporation return but they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.601" offset="10141759">They filed a petition return just as we filed the 990 as required first by the regulations in 1951 and by the statute in 1953 -- 1941 to 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.817" offset="10218663">If Balkan is right and if the Court of Appeals of District of Columbia is right, the statute of limitations run from the due date on which the return was supposed to be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.136" offset="10279894">If Germantown is the one to follow, then the statute of limitations run from the date on which we filed the Form 990, which was the only return we were required to file.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.106" offset="10331826">And I will take the counsel for Government's statement where the decision was against the taxpayer in which he said the taxpayer could not benefit by information and say the same thing with respect to the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.808" offset="10406640">Now, let's find out the real truth of this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.295" offset="10424508">It is my humble opinion that the Commissioner just failed to protect the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.087" offset="10447705">He knew of Germantown Trust, decided, I think, in 1939, he knew of -- both the Insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.872" offset="10482813">He just failed to protect the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.763" offset="10498382">Now, why the statute of limitations?</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.709" offset="10510190">If the taxpayer is right, the statute makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.561" offset="10529625">The statute says we post cases right or wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.303" offset="10548537">It ends it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.265" offset="10556479">Justice Black, I think, will remember a considerable debate on the floor of the Senate back in 1926, where Senator Carter Glass insisted on cutting the statute from five years to three years and he was joined in -- by the event of Senator Black in order to settle these cases sooner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.372" offset="10644877">In our humble opinion, the statute of limitation is wrong and the Second Circuit and the Court of Appeals and this Court in Germantown were right.</text>

            <text syncTime="2710.581" offset="10945703">The issues I have been discussing now retroactive revocation and statute of limitations applied only to 1943 and 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.857" offset="10978826">The accounting question applies all the way through from 1943 down to the present time specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.351" offset="11020727">The Government realize as it must upon the decision is based and which the doctrine of claim of right is based.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.130" offset="11079868">The government counsel failed because it was utterly impossible to show the application of a document claim of right to any case in which there was an established method of accounting of longstanding which would pick the particular (Inaudible) in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.654" offset="11161997">Now, he says our commercial accounting method is no good.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.316" offset="11176626">We can't rely on it for tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.442" offset="11197106">May I point out to you that the method we follow is, first, the method followed by substantially all newspapers of this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="2790.690" offset="11266173">And if you then have any doubt about it, it is the method prescribed by the Civil Aeronautics Board for airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.569" offset="11301700">There's nothing strange or unusual about this system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.788" offset="11318523">It was adopted in -- according to the record in 1934, as a matter of fact, it was adopted 10 years before that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2839.277" offset="11460524">Why have you supposed the Commissioner of Internal Revenue changed the method of accounting?</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.987" offset="11483303">Why didn't he like our method?</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.595" offset="11493752">Certified to every year by an independent certified public accountant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.695" offset="11518203">The answer is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.761" offset="11530428">Had he used our method?</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.511" offset="11553416">There wouldn't have been practically no tax due.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.561" offset="11569612">Only by changing that method could he impose a tax upon us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.573" offset="11597615">Now, the Automobile Club is no better off no whistle regardless of the method of accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.358" offset="11616841">And I venture to say in my well-considered opinion that if I were to take the balance sheet and the profit law statements which the Commissioner required in this case to a bank for a loan, I would be accused of misrepresenting the financial position of the automobile property tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.086" offset="11703672">It doesn't -- anywhere as near represent the financial standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.816" offset="11726660">Now, as the counsel for the Government says, “But Section 41 gives the Commission a power.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.050" offset="11771591">If he doesn't like your system, it gives him power to adopt a new one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.147" offset="11811924">The Commissioner has been controlled in this matter exactly as he has been controlled in other actions.His system must be better than the taxpayer's system or it doesn't take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.893" offset="11886947">I won't read but I will tell you about the dissenting opinion of Judge Opper in the Tax Court in the California Grape Products case which is one of the three cases which ratifies and endorses this principle of accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.354" offset="11972838">He was writing a dissent for six on the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.947" offset="11991124">He says, “We are getting much too careless in upsetting taxpayer's accounting records.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.781" offset="12038457">If their accounting method year in and year out followed consistently consistent -- consistently even though in one particular year, it may be some strange thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.288" offset="12088508">If you follow it consistently, it's good.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.549" offset="12101569">And that is the principle which the courts have followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.466" offset="12113272">Now, government counsel in this respect asks you to overrule the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.109" offset="12167816">All three of those courts and -- and the only three cases that gotten up so far to the Court of Appeals as far as I know on this -- on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.762" offset="12206373">Every one of us went against the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.893" offset="12218911">Now, the counsel for the Government spends a little time on legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.234" offset="12248273">An anticipation of that, we give you the legislative history particularly the repeal of this Section 452 and 462.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.880" offset="12290905">In that repeal, the Senate Finance Committee said specifically, “We like the Beacon Publishing Company rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.865" offset="12330820">We like the California Grape Products Company rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.220" offset="12352240">We expected the Commissioner will make those rules generally applicable and if he doesn't and if the courts don't correct the Commissioner, then and only then, if I may differ with the counsel for the Government, then and only then, will it be legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.506" offset="12425383">Now, why didn't they make this retroactive?</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.319" offset="12436668">It's always difficult, but it was counsel legislative draftsman for many years and counsel in the Treasury for many years in legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.703" offset="12474180">It's always difficult to know when to make things retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.623" offset="12489853">There are group of cases in litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.775" offset="12502497">Congress almost invariably adopts the policy of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.364" offset="12516812">Let them point it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.292" offset="12520573">The courts can work it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.354" offset="12532799">Now, in conclusion, I would say that a victory for the Government in this case will be most costly as a matter of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.601" offset="12597791">If I, the tax practitioner, cannot rely on the rulings of the Treasury, of the Bureau, then I know the Treasury as other taxpayers and practitioner are going to do the same thing, the Treasury is going to lose money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.121" offset="12679816">The Commissioner is going to be embarrassed because the taxpayers will have lost confidence in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.258" offset="12704371">Who knows how he can control as counsel for the Government admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.423" offset="12725060">If you want to scrap the power to revoke in instances like this, you can go back to everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.473" offset="12745226">There is no stopping.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.416" offset="12765080">And it will be exceedingly bad for taxpayers because as Justice Frankfurter said yesterday, “The system is terrifically complicated.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.500" offset="12809383">And if I may say, it is getting more complicated every session of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.636" offset="12825893">Someone has to take the burden of responsibility of giving interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.004" offset="12843342">We will follow them as far as we can.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.139" offset="12855881">I have one policy in my office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.117" offset="12863822">I will pay every penny of tax the taxpayer owes no more no less.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.542" offset="12885556">Now, if I can't rely on rulings of the Treasury, what am I going to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.600" offset="12909798">It will be a costly decision for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.236" offset="12928293">And furthermore, if I understand this case, it will mean that this Court admits that there is no control over the actions of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, no control whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.128" offset="12979911">I have never seen anything so arbitrary, so inexcusable as this action in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.303" offset="13008541">Now, I will close by reading your statement which is peculiarly applicable to our accounting system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.738" offset="13050337">And to the policies back of all accounting systems for tax purposes for commercial purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.942" offset="13079176">There was philosopher much greater than I, who said, “Consistency, thou art a jewel.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.232" offset="13108328">And if Your Honors please, it is consistency in accounting principles upon which our tax system rest and not peculiarities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.686" offset="13154095">And this accounting system has been followed virtually forever.</text>
