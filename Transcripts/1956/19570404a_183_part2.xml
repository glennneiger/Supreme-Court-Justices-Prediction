            <label>Mr. John F. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="9.211" offset="140204">Chief Justice, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.536" offset="165491">I assume the Court understands the reason I'm back up here after the time that was given this morning is that in granting certiorari in this case, the Court's order separated two questions from the others and requested they be separately argued and assigned an hour to that time of which 30 minutes is mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.739" offset="250337">And therefore, these 30 minutes is, by the initial order of the Court, to be -- to be spent on what are called question seven and 11 which I've quoted at page 6 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.230" offset="332257">Before going into my argument, I'd like to comment on Mr. Singer's comment with respect to the instructions to the jury referring to the printed transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.031" offset="387532">He read to the Court from the top of page 748, a paragraph in which the Court said that if you find any witness has willfully testified falsely, you may disregard his entire testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.727" offset="454301">And the impression I got from the statement was that this was supposed to apply to what followed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.078" offset="487633">Actually, if we turn back to the preceding page, we find that the Court had been talking about the coconspirators and their testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.833" offset="530683">They were Government witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.629" offset="537893">Their testimony in the case and the fact that the jury had to take this -- this testimony by coconspirators who had consistently lied that they had to consider that in the determination, so I think it follows naturally from precedes rather than from what follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.922" offset="631097">Question seven in the order -- as stated in the order of the Court says, does it constitute due process to subpoena a person to testify before a grand jury in an investigation of which he is a primary target and thereby, permit an examination before trial of a de facto defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.053" offset="751574">Now, on this question as stated, the state courts have split right down in the middle, we cite some of the holdings on pages 92 and 93 of -- of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.749" offset="806327">This Court has not passed upon the issue, although Counselman against Hitchcock has been cited by counsel as barring on it, I think, it has no barring on this question.</text>

            <text syncTime="280.275" offset="1224495">I think that the difficulty of the question is -- is partially demonstrated by the difficulty in -- in phrasing it properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.989" offset="1263365">On the facts that we have in this case, I would say there has been no split of authority anywhere that on the factual situation, which we have here, even though these courts which say that it is improper to call certain witnesses before the grand jury would not say that it was improper to call Mr. Halperin before the grand jury in Brooklyn.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.169" offset="1356048">We must remember that the Brooklyn grand jury has been in panel to examine into frauds in the administration of the Bureau of Internal Revenue in the Eastern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.451" offset="1413204">This appears from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.209" offset="1424175">Now, insofar as there was a primary target for this investigation, it was obviously to be found among employees of the Bureau of Internal Revenue.Halperin was a source of information with respect to such a primary target.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.545" offset="1489586">He was not himself, the final object to the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.948" offset="1511215">The conspirators themselves in talking before they went before the grand jury were in agreement that they were in no danger with respect to being indicted by the Brooklyn grand jury because none of the acts which had been disclosed took place within the jurisdiction of the Eastern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.118" offset="1603793">And in fact, the -- the grand jury did not bring any indictment against Halperin of its New York defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.646" offset="1637961">I was, for a long time, puzzled as to why -- why the grand jury in Eastern -- deprived this matter with -- brought in the Eastern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.423" offset="1689057">And my guess is, and this is a guess, but I think it -- it may be -- may be the reason Mr. Bolich who was later indicted by the Brooklyn grand jury for -- for his own tax evasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.947" offset="1763140">He was a resident of -- of Long Island and I think that the -- the matter was brought in the Eastern District because actually, they were -- they were shooting for the man in the Bureau of Internal Revenue whose residence was in the Eastern District.</text>
