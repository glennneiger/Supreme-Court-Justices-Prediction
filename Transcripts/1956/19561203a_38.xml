            <text syncTime="90.780" offset="466526">But the circumstances which impelled the Court to bring the case here and the circumstances which are disclosed by this record are circumstances which show what a wide gap there can be between the standards which this Court has laid down for the administration of the criminal law and the manner in which those standards are carried out in actual practice in some of the District Courts of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="256.071" offset="1127633">Well, the -- the case arose in the District of Minnesota, in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.789" offset="1162533">The offense alleged was an offense under Section 1702 of the Criminal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.228" offset="1192312">It was alleged and petitioner pleaded guilty to the allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.734" offset="1210284">It was alleged that petitioner had taken from the United States mails a check, a Treasury check before the delivery to the owner thereof.</text>

            <text syncTime="293.782" offset="1278516">The plea of guilty was entered before Judge Joyce of the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota in September of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.321" offset="1316655">And thereupon, the judge referred the case, in fact for a probation report.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.487" offset="1341315">Approximately three weeks later on October 3rd, 1952, the Court -- the Court called the case up for sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.873" offset="1382902">What happened at the sentencing proceeding on October 3rd, 1952 is vital to the issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.033" offset="1443506">When the case was called, the United States Attorney said that the matter was here for sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.677" offset="1482062">The judge had a colloquy with the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.716" offset="1494288">And in the course of that colloquy as the record shows on pages 4 to 6 and as I've set forth in my brief in full on pages 7 and 9, as the record shows, the judge asked the defendant some questions about his history.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.031" offset="1559489">It turned out the defendant at the time the case came up to sentencing was in the Minnesota State Prison and still was serving a sentence and he was shortly due to come out for a parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.506" offset="1605360">The judge ascertained as apparently he had ascertained from the probation report that the petitioner have had an alcoholic history and this particular episode of taking the check from the Government -- taking the government check from the mail had arisen during an alcoholic spree.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.853" offset="1690833">He called attention to the fact that the probation report showed that petitioner had voluntary brought this, the fact to this offense to the attention of Alcoholics Anonymous and then to the attention of the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.165" offset="1747989">The petitioner's record in the Minnesota state penitentiary was a good record and he indicated that he had licked the alcohol problem and he said this appeal to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.646" offset="1805981">He said to the defendant the -- that you ought to know the misery and the grief of continued drinking on your part and he gave him advice that the moment he got out of prison, he should go to Alcoholics Anonymous to do what they told them to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.199" offset="1872123">He said with your background and with your ability, I think that you can win this fight.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.040" offset="1899499">Then he said and I think this is the source of the great difference between myself and the Government in this case, then he said, “If you don't do those things and if you want to revert to drinking, you will be back here again because you will commit some federal offense and I won't be talking to you this way if you were ever before me again.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.993" offset="1987375">So, good luck to you and I hope the parole board will give you an opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.232" offset="2008273">That is all.”</text>
            <text syncTime="477.705" offset="2014229">And the defendant said, “Thank you very much, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="480.705" offset="2026141">And the defendant was taken in the courtroom and returned to the Minnesota state penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.530" offset="2049442">Several months later, he was paroled.</text>

            <text syncTime="492.539" offset="2073579">No, Mr. Justice Harlan, the construction that the -- we placed on this for petitioner is that the judge made a final disposition of the case but the judge decided under the circumstances which had been brought to a detention that although the man was guilty of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.636" offset="2141915">Nevertheless, it was a case where neither imprisonment nor probation should be imposed and that so far as the federal authorities were concerned, the petitioner should be allowed to go from the Court a freeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.451" offset="2193220">And I point out in this connection, Mr. Justice Harlan, that the statute under which this offense was committed and under which the information was filed is a statute which does not provide for any minimum level of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.468" offset="2249226">Unlike many other federal criminal statutes which say that a man shall be sentenced to not less than so many years in jail or fine not less than so many dollars this statute does not say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.820" offset="2298650">The statute says that the punishment shall be not more than five years in jail or not more than $2000 fine or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.643" offset="2333968">But it leaves completely to the discretion of the judge the question whether some punishment should be imposed and if so, how much.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.080" offset="2367718">And it was in the exercise of that discretion as we look at this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.661" offset="2386004">It was in the exercise of that discretion that the judge sent this man out of court without committing him to jail and without fining.</text>

            <text syncTime="1885.144" offset="7643930">I shall indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.257" offset="7652394">The Government says in its brief that if I'm wrong about what happened on October 3, 1952 and they think I am wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.687" offset="7690115">Then this case should be judged in the following light.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.451" offset="7709132">The case should be looked at as if nothing really happened on October 3, 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.972" offset="7731284">The order added was nullity and the case was just left hanging in suspense for two years until Mr. Pollard was brought back in for violation of probation and then a sentence of two years imprisonment was imposed upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.762" offset="7806412">Now, among the ways in which the petitioner deals with that question has been to say that a delay otherwise unjustifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.270" offset="7860433">A delay of two years, approximately two full years, from the time of plea of guilty to the time of imposition of sentence, it's wholly unreasonable and goes beyond the limits permitted either by the federal rules which required that sentence shall be imposed without unreasonable delay or by the Speedy Trial Clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.450" offset="7969207">In order to make the latter argument which is a constitutional argument, it's necessary to come to the conclusion that the sentencing portion of the criminal proceeding is in fact part of a trial within the meaning of the speedy trial guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.531" offset="8037543">And we say in the brief that our position on that is (Inaudible) by two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.686" offset="8062098">First, what we know about the great purpose of the speedy trial provision which is largely to protect defendants from being subjected to vexatious and oppressive delays by what an old decision calls the Ministers of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.227" offset="8136286">So, we say the purpose is in favor of that instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.067" offset="8151646">In addition, we say that the text is in favor of that instruction and the example that I've used in the brief is this, the phrase in the Constitution is a phrase referring to speedy and public trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.754" offset="8210369">We say that the word trial when interpreted with reference to the word speedy, obviously must have the same meaning as the word trial when interpreted with reference with the word public, since the two adjectives both immediately proceed the same noun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.564" offset="8277661">We say that if a judge, if a federal judge were to sentence a man in a secret session, even though the trial had been held in open session that that secret sentencing would violate the public trial provision of the Constitution and that it would violate it because the word trial textually includes the sentencing portion of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.792" offset="8394585">For the same reason, we say that the word speedy when we are using the word -- the phrase speedy trial, we say that the word speedy trial include the sentencing portion of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.751" offset="8458428">And as to the one case the Government relies on to the -- apparently which the Government looks to or held in the other direction, namely, Miller and Aderhold, I think in 288 U.S., we say that there were several distinguishing circumstances that make it inapplicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.596" offset="8533765">One is that the length of time involved was considerably shorter, namely, the lapse of time between the time of sentence -- between the time of conviction and the time of sentence was only six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.825" offset="8598653">Two, we say also that in that case and possibly for the very reason I have just given, no question was raised by the defendant as to the Speedy Trial Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.422" offset="8645047">Now obviously, these are matters of degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.179" offset="8660093">Some period of time would not be long enough to get into a problem under the Speedy Trial Clause or this will be certainly long enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.450" offset="8693217">And we say that the two years for the last year when the fault was wholly resting upon both the Government and the U.S. Attorney and not upon petitioner, we say that those two years made it too long and that the just disposition of the case when petitioner was brought back to court on September of 1954 would have been to enter the order we asked to be entered now, namely, an order that the Court should not have made any sentence imposed any sentence in September of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.353" offset="8820799">And that that order is important to petitioner because as this Court has held in the Morgan and Fiswick cases, future civil rights may be affected and subsequent punishments in the event with a future crime may be lengthier if this sentencing order is to stand even though petitioner has now served the sentence.</text>
