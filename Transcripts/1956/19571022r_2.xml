            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">Number 2, Oleta O'Connor Yates versus United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.884" offset="59455">Mr. Branton.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leo_branton_jr" startTime="16.001" stopTime="284.486">
            <label>Mr. Leo Branton, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="16.001" offset="63948">May it please the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="20.620" offset="82442">This, like the case of yesterday, is a case involving the power of the court to punish for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.431" offset="121626">However, unlike the case of yesterday, it involves a different kind of a contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.889" offset="147540">This is a contempt which grew out of the Los Angeles Smith Act trial, also known as Yates versus the United States, which was argued last term before this Court and which this Court reversed on June the 17th of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.171" offset="224653">At the Los Angeles Smith Act trial in 1952, at the end of the prosecution's case, ten of defendants rested their case without putting on any evidence and four did not rest their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.865" offset="287451">The petitioner in this case Mrs. Yates was one of those four.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.221" offset="308872">She also is the only defendant to have testified in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.531" offset="338024">Now there were three different contempts arising out of her testimony and I'm going to take some time, if I might, to briefly summarize each of these contempt cases even though there is only one of the contempt cases which is before this Court on petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.584" offset="410331">And the reason that I'm going to do is because I believe that you will agree with me after I've given these facts that these contempts are so closely interrelated that one must know what happened in each of the other contempt cases in order to properly decide this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.601" offset="482325">Mrs. Yates testified on direct examination for nine days during the course of which time she answered fully and completely every question concerning herself, when she had become a communist, why she had become a communist, the things that she believed in as a communist, the things that she had fought for during all of her life.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.194" offset="560692">On cross-examination, she likewise answered fully and completely all questions concerning herself and her own activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.859" offset="591412">However, there came an area of questions which she refused to answer, and this came on the first day of cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.542" offset="622132">She was asked four different questions, each of which she refused to answer and she gave the reason for refusing to answer these questions as a desire not to become an informer because the answer to each of these questions would necessarily name someone else, someone else other than herself as a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.086" offset="724323">And she believed that in the present times when there was so much anticommunist hysteria that to identify other people as members of the Communist Party was subject to bring some harm to that person or to that person's family and perhaps visit physical violence upon that person or that person's family and she could not in good conscience bring herself to be that kind of a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.496" offset="825887">This in essence was the basis of her refusal which she spelled clearly to the court on the first day that she refused to answer these four particular questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.574" offset="866220">At that time the court told her that he appreciated the fact that she just didn't want to become an informer, that perhaps the jury might agree with her, the jury might understand what it is to be an informer, however, the orders of that Court had to be carried out and consequently he directed her to answer, upon her refusal to answer, he ordered to jail, to remain there until she did answer the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.229" offset="972904">So that she remained in jail for the rest of the trial which was some 43 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.009" offset="999967">He held that that was civil contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.157" offset="1012611">Then the cross-examination proceeded for another three days during which time she again answered all questions concerning herself until on the third day as she was getting – as the prosecutor was nearing the end of the day, the trial judge turned to the prosecutor and said, “Mr. Nucum you ought to be getting pretty close to the end of your cross-examination now” and the prosecutor said, “Well, I intend to go all day tomorrow,” whereupon the trial judge said, “You are just waiting time now, come on get along with the case.”</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="284.486" offset="1137894">What was the time interval between the first episode and the one you are talking about?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leo_branton_jr" startTime="289.056" stopTime="289.892">
            <label>Mr. Leo Branton, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="289.056" offset="1156180">Three days.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="289.892" stopTime="291.948">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="289.892" offset="1159523">Three days.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leo_branton_jr" startTime="291.948" stopTime="628.375">
            <label>Mr. Leo Branton, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="291.948" offset="1167778">Whereupon -- whereupon the prosecutor immediately without further ado began to put other questions to her which said questions necessary called for her identification of other people as members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.731" offset="1234860">He put eleven separate questions to her, which she refused to answer and said, “I repeat these – this is the same kind of a question you asked me the other day and no matter how many times you ask me to identify these people as members of the Communist Party, I can't bring myself to do so.”</text>
            <text syncTime="323.422" offset="1293688">The court at that time held that he treated the eleven contempts of that day as criminal contempt and he treated them as separate contempts from those of the third of cross-examination, from those which had jailed her civilly and on the first day of cross-examination, and he postponed a sentence upon that until the end of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.567" offset="1374250">Now this was on June the 26th.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.964" offset="1387833">Then on August 6th the jury found all defendants guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.926" offset="1407687">The next day the trial judge sentenced each defendant to $10000 fine and five years in jail, the maximum allowed under the Smith Act at that time and on the same day or the next day, I don't recall which, the court sentenced the defendant Yates to one year in jail for the contempt of the third day of cross-examination to which the eleven questions which he had ruled was criminal contempt rather than civil contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.325" offset="1525238">Now all of the defendants applied for bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.789" offset="1543105">Bail was refused by the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.701" offset="1554704">We went to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals which held that there was a substantial question and ordered the Trial Court to set bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.328" offset="1581244">The Trial Court still refused to set bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.930" offset="1591693">We went back to the Ninth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit itself set bail at the sum of $20,000 as to each defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.203" offset="1616771">However, the marshal refused the release the defendant Yates even though the $20,000 bail was deposited because he said he was still holding the defendant Yates in jail pursuant to a certificate of civil contempt, which the Court had ordered on the first day of a cross-examination and consequently until the Court ordered her release, she was in jail or still should be in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.892" offset="1707468">Now Judge Mathes, the trial judge, was not in the jurisdiction at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.452" offset="1721783">Mrs. Yates was taken before another judge who ordered her release upon the stipulation that she would present herself a couple of days later before Judge Mathes to see what his ruling would be concerning the civil contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.438" offset="1765669">So two days later the defendant appeared before Judge Mathes, at which time Judge Mathes ruled -- asked her if she was still willing to answer the questions which she had refused to answer on the first day and for which he had jailed her for 43 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.387" offset="1829512">She said, “My position is still the same Your Honor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="460.332" offset="1841319">The judge held that the prosection was still entitled to those answers in spite of our argument that she could no longer purge of contempt the trial being over and he ordered her back to jail where she was remain until she answered the questions which would have in affect been -- may have been a life time sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.229" offset="1920836">We asked for bail for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.813" offset="1927210">The trial judge denied bail, we went to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals who then fixed bail to the sum of $1000 on this contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.118" offset="1960438">She got out on bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.820" offset="1967229">After she got out on bail, the trial judge summoned her before the court a third time, this was 30 days after the trial was over, at which time he told her that because of her refusal to answer the questions of the first day for which she had – she had already spent 43 days in jail and for he held she would have to stay in jail until she answered and for which we had just got her out on appeal, he said he was now going to treat that as criminal contempt and he sentenced her to three years in jail for that contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.979" offset="2103902">All three of those of cases of contempt went to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.269" offset="2125009">The Ninth Circuit reversed the contempt which called for her staying in jail until she answered the questions on the obvious ground that the trial being over, she could no longer purge herself and that since that was civil contempt, the government was no longer entitled to those answers and ordered a reversal of that contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.852" offset="2211318">The Ninth Circuit also reversed the three-year sentence of contempt on the grounds that it was a denial of due process to the defendant Yates to first punish her in civil contempt and send her to jail for 43 days incidentally by the time she – all of these, she was jailed after each one of those contempt citations and it took us some time for the machinery of bail to get her out, by this time she had spent in excess of 70 days in jail because of these contempts rather than the 43 days which she spent prior to the time of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.913" offset="2347572">At any rate, this three-year sentence was likewise reversed by the Ninth Circuit on the grounds that it was a denial of due process for the Court to first punish her civilly and then without giving her any warning or any notice that was willing to punish her again, after the trial was over to punish her criminally for that same contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.349" offset="2425313">The court affirmed, however, the one-year sentence of contempt and to repeat myself perhaps but in order that we might get the complete picture, this was the sentence wherein she had refused to answer questions on the third day of cross-examination and which the court at the time said that it was going to treat differently from the contempt of the first day of cross-examination.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leo Branton, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="633.095" offset="2532310">That is the appeal that is before us today.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.336" offset="2549342">Now that brings us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.517" offset="2561985">When the Ninth Circuit reversed, I'm sorry, affirmed the one-year sentence it stated that the contempt of June 20th to with the third day of cross-examination were different and separate contempts of the 26th of June, the first day of cross examination but it gave no reason for holding that these contempts were separate and distinct and this brings us to the first point which we argue here on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.506" offset="2717989">Our first point which we believe calls for a reversal by this Court is the fact that the contempt of June 30th, if it was a contempt at all, and I say ‘if it was a contempt' because on an argument which I will make later I think that I have a very valid argument that there was not even a contempt permitted on June 30th but for purposes of this first point, I want to assume for a moment that there was a contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.980" offset="2819866">If there was a contempt at all it was not a contempt committed on June 30th but the only contempt in this case was committed on June 26th at which time the witness said, “I will answer all questions excepting questions which will call for my identification of other people as members of the Communist Party.”</text>
            <text syncTime="732.022" offset="2928013">At that time her contempt was tolled and thereafter the prosecution could not multiply the contempts in this case, if the prosecution asked her to identify 5 people, 11 people or 5000 people, this is the holding of the Costello case.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.758" offset="2998962">The government agrees with the Costello case.</text>

            <text syncTime="754.558" offset="3018188">Even though they were different people.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.840" offset="3023308">In the Costello case, Mr. Costello Your Honor had refused and stated, “I'm not going to answer any questions at all” and thereafter he was asked three different questions, one question did he know one person, one question did he know (Inaudible) and one other person, all of which questions he refused to answer and the – he was held in separate contempts for those refusals and the court said that once he had said he was going to answer no questions, the court could not multiply the contempt by holding – answering questions which called for different people, and consequently there was only one contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.729" offset="3174818">Now the Court – as I said the government accepts that case, but yet it claims that that the Yates case is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.243" offset="3216927">I don't really know why other than what they argue in their brief but in a moment I'll attempt to show you that in my opinion that has no merit –</text>

            <text syncTime="841.278" offset="3365094">The trial judge in the case mistakenly considered each separate refusal as a separate contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.255" offset="3400934">The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals treated the contempts of June 26 as different from the contempts of June 30th, but it does not say why.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.334" offset="3445238">The government argues two possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.019" offset="3456000">It argues that the contempt of June 30th was different because it concerned different individuals, the Costello case is a complete answer to that argument I believe, but it also argues that the contempts took place on a separate day.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.963" offset="3535830">I have been unable to find any cases of contempt which say that a contempt committed -- a question which is answered or which a witness refuses to answer on one day makes it any different than a question which she had refused, the witness refused to answer on the day before because if you follow that logic I think you can get into an absurdity.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.852" offset="3627363">Here our two witnesses who testifying before a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.314" offset="3645231">One witness refuses to answer a question after having stated his position, “There are certain kinds of questions I will not answer.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1077.259" offset="4308950">Then it is true that on the 30th she did add to her answer the fact she would identify people as communist wherein the answer to that question would not hurt anyone.</text>

            <text syncTime="1114.577" offset="4458266">The trial judge could not tell, neither could the prosecutor tell, whether or not the answer to a question would hurt anyone or not, but in my opinion it is not necessary for there to be an objective by which the trial judge or the prosecutor can know whether or not an answer to a question will hurt someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.648" offset="4554501">The fact is once the question is put and once the answer makes that question fall into the category of the refusal that the witness had carved out for herself, it becomes a part of the original contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.880" offset="4619494">Now let me give you what I mean, and let me tell you why that should be the policy of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.239" offset="4652931">A witness like Mr. Costello who says I won't answer any questions can only be in contempt one time no matter how many questions are put, but here is a witness who says in the beginning, “I'm not going to answer any questions that will hurt anybody” or rather “I'm not going to answer any questions that will identify anybody as a member of the Communist Party” and then she narrows this a little bit by saying, “Well, I will answer questions of people who can't be hurt by this.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.318" offset="4773198">In my opinion that witness is showing her complete good faith in narrowing it because if she had refused to identify people for example like William Z. Foster, who was the acknowledged head of the Communist Party, who was publically a communist, which question she did answer incidentally Mr. Justice Whittaker, she did answer questions about some people and she answered a question about a fellow by the name of Mike Quinn, because in her opinion, she said Mike Quinn is dead and Mike Quinn can't be hurt anymore, so I have -- I will name Mike Quinn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.379" offset="4921469">I think the policy of the law should be to encourage as much testimony from a witness as possible rather than to discourage that witness from testifying because what that witness was doing when answered some of those questions, and I think without weaving her position was showing her complete good faith because in the beginning she said I'm not going to identify anybody who can be hurt, so that if she had refused to identify Mike Quinn, then this Court could have said why you aren't even in good faith, because you can't hurt Mike Quinn, Mike Quinn is dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.056" offset="5056157">So she did name Mike Quinn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.193" offset="5064725">In my opinion, the policy of the law should be not to punish her by holding her in contempt many times because of the fact that she did identify some people who she could not hurt, because if that's going to be the policy of the law that the safest thing for this witness to have done on cross examination was to say I'm just not going to answer any questions at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.188" offset="5160751">And so for that reason, I think the fact that she did answer those particular questions is of no significance whatsoever and should not be under the law and could be justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.399" offset="5201502">Now the second point and I think that this point gets us to the point which was raised by Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.312" offset="5241208">We say that in this case, while the judge treated this attempt as criminal, and he labelled it as criminal, actually it was civil contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.371" offset="5297424">And it was civil contempt because of the way the judge treated it for the purpose of the punishment here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.370" offset="5321456">I need not remind this Court of the difference between civil contempt and criminal contempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="1342.653" offset="5370567">Mr. Justice Frankfurter suffice it to say that the purpose of civil contempt is coercing to get the answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.383" offset="5417482">Well the benefit of the parties seeking those answers, while on the other hand, the purpose of criminal contempt is not coercive at all, but it is impunity, it is to vindicate the authority of the court in order to deter any possible future contention and it's not to coerce the answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.506" offset="5485923">Now let's examine what happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.988" offset="5495850">As I said it's not the label which makes it criminal attempt, but it's the character and the purpose of the punishment which controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.973" offset="5527824">This was held by (Inaudible) and by several other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.485" offset="5545900">We can only tell what the essential purpose of the court was in this case by examining what the court said and what the court did at the time of the sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.144" offset="5584562">Now at the time of the first contempt which is unquestionably civil, nobody disputes that, this was the language that court used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.194" offset="5620715">To borrow language from some of the cases, you carry the key to your jail in your own purse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.398" offset="5645584">You may purge yourself at anytime and be discharged from custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.710" offset="5666795">This is typical language of civil contempt, carrying the keys to the jail in your own pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.498" offset="5689992">I think it was quoted from some case, the name of which I cannot recall at this point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.863" offset="5711412">Also the court at the time of ordering her back to jail under civil contempt stating isn't the government entitled to those answers which she according to the orders of the court should have given, and in case there is another trial of the case, if she should elect to take the stand, the government should have those answers, again this signifies that they treated this as civil contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.601" offset="5806393">Now what did the court say at the time of the second contempt, and this is the contempt that is now before this Court, the contempt which he labeled as criminal, but which we say was actually civil and he had no power to give a punitive sentence because of the fact that he treated it as civil, the court said this and this language appears at page of the transcript of the record and it's also in the record of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals which is 13541, which we also filed with the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1488.908" offset="5955605">The court said I had hoped by this time that Mrs. Yates might be willing to purge herself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.885" offset="5987474">That she might be prompted to do so and again at page 36 and 37, the court said I hope Mrs. Yates will yet purge herself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.231" offset="6032823">I am not interested in imprisoning Mrs. Yates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.460" offset="6049750">This is the language of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.363" offset="6057378">Well why isn't the court interested in imprisoning Mrs. Yates because imprisonment would be punitive and the court wasn't interested in any punitive imprisonment here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.460" offset="6109832">He wasn't interested in vindicating the authority of a court, the reasons was that he wanted the answers, because if he was going to punish her criminally, she couldn't purge herself from criminal contempt as he says here, and he wouldn't have used this language about being interested in having the answers if the purpose of his sentence was punitive rather than civil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.546" offset="6206171">Now did the court say at the time of the third contempt, now this was 30 days after the case was over?</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.022" offset="6228010">The court said, do you wish to answer the questions at this time Mrs. Yates, this was even after the case was over, you could end it all, there is simply Mrs. Yates by answering the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.762" offset="6282971">If you disposed to purge yourself of this contempt and obey all lawful orders of the court I will entertain a motion to modify any one, not only this sentence, but any other of these sentences heretofore invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.193" offset="6332709">And then at the time of his written judgment, he said if and when at any time prior to defendant release from custody following execution of the concurrent three-year sentences, the defendant shall purge herself of contempt by answering under oath the questions, then the concurrent three-year term of imprisonment herein shall ipso facto cease and terminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.173" offset="6416614">Now the government says that if is any different contempt proceeding and has no bearing upon the contempt which is before this Court, but we say that it does, because if the court 30 days after a trial is over, when it is no longer possible to recall the jury in that case, is still interested in getting the answers and tells her he hopes that -- does she still want to answer the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.997" offset="6519954">And he hopes that she would purge herself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.165" offset="6528627">In my opinion it has very distinct bearing upon the question which was asked, rather has distinct bearing upon how the court felt at the time of the first sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.991" offset="6591948">Now to get specifically to the question which Mr. Justice Harlan asked?</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.047" offset="6636147">The court – the government argues that even if it was one contempt, the court could treat the contempt both civilly and permanently, because it maybe a continuing attempt, and it cites the United Mine Workers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.072" offset="6748264">I believe that the answer to that is, that in the first place, the contempt was not continuing, that the questions which she refused to answer on June 30th was not a contempt, but was only a reiteration of the position which she had stated on June the 26th and that no contempt was committed at that time, and if there was a contempt, the contempt was committed on June the 26th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.937" offset="6863726">And if you can say that the court has the power to punish both civilly and criminally for one contempt, the court did attempt to do so in this case because the court attempted to treat the civil contempt as criminal by giving a three-year sentence, so that if there is only contempt, the court has held her in jail for the 43 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.214" offset="6956826">It has given her a three-year sentence for the same contempt, which sentence was reversed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and which sentence is now final, the government did not appeal from that, and that is the law of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1936.766" offset="7746978">The prosecutor has no way of knowing who belongs to that family and he starts putting names, Joe Jones, Joe Smith and so forth and so forth and she gets to some question she answers some question and she refuses answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.762" offset="7795043">The prosecutor cannot then say well I didn't know that Joe Jones was a member of your family, so I think the fact that she spells out the area is the only thing that is important, and as long as the refusal to answer specific questions thereafter falls within the area which she has spelled out for herself, and it is a question of good faith and here I don't think there is -- undoubtedly there was good faith and all of the people whom she refused to answer, I think then that there is only one contempt committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.660" offset="7906638">Now I get to my third point, this is that the sentence in this case was arbitrarily imposed and was a gross use of discretion and constituted a cruel and inhuman punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.199" offset="7952718">And now I come to a part of my argument which I said from the beginning what I argued, point one I said for purposes of that argument I was going to assume that, that was a contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.474" offset="7997858">Here I am going to argue and I think with much validity, that there was no punishable contempt in this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.708" offset="8030772">Now we have to remember that we are dealing with a summary contempt power of the court, a power which offers tremendous possibilities of abuse, and that Congress and the courts have recognized this, beginning with the first Judiciary Act of 1789 and then following the famous impeachment of Judge Peck, we had the Act of March 2, 1831; and finally what we know is 18 U.S.C 401.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.617" offset="8138397">This does not involve a question of the power of the court to punish for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.487" offset="8153861">Of course a court has the power to punish for contempt, but I say that, that power is strictly construed by Section 401 of 18 U.S.C and by the cases which have drastically curtailed the power of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.724" offset="8226795">And the reason the court had been so zealous in guarding the rights of individuals in this kind of contempt because it is summary contempt, where we don't have the protection of the Bill of Rights, we don't have that kind of indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.473" offset="8269845">We don't have that confrontation of witness, the right of cross examination, and the right to be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, but here the judge acts as -- he acts as the person bringing the indictment, the prosecutor and the sentencing judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.809" offset="8331180">Whey then, we ask this extraordinary power?</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.119" offset="8344451">The only reason this extraordinary power was given to the court is in order to prevent an obstruction to the performance of the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.514" offset="8381962">And the cases of Henry Hudgins and the Michael's case which I've cited in my brief make clear that obstruction of the judicial process is a necessary element which must be found in every summary contempt case before the court has a new power to punish for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.171" offset="8448627">If the conduct did not obstruct, then the use of the contempt power is not justified.</text>

            <text syncTime="3690.214" offset="14760856">This, this witness was on cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.261" offset="14772976">Under it she had testified that she had never conspired with anyone to advocate the violent overthrow of the government and that to the best of her knowledge and belief, the Communist Party of the United States did not so teach or advocate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.115" offset="14832431">Now that goes to the heart of what this case was about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.608" offset="14846328">The indictment charged the defendants with having conspired to advocate the violent overthrow of the government and to organize as the Communist Party of the United States a group of persons who so advocate and teach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.742" offset="14906932">The Communist Party under the government's theory was the instrumentality, the vehicle of this conspiracy and this Court recognized it in the Yates' opinion last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.570" offset="14946220">Therefore when the -- Mrs. Yates made what was referred to in the record as the bold, bold denial that she knew, that she ever advocated the violent overthrow of the government or that the Communist Party had ever so thought, it became relevant for the prosecution to test, to test the veracity, the credibility et cetera of that direct testimony by inquiring -- by asking her these questions as to whether not she knew these various persons who have played such a prominent part in the government's case whether she knew they had been communists or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.629" offset="15110478">The issue was -- I mean I think the purpose of these questions was not to get her to inform on anyone, the government, the government's testimony clearly established that these persons were communists, but as on page 5 to 6 of the record, the point of these questions I think becomes clearer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.005" offset="15195951">In specification 4, “Is it not true that Ida Rothstein has for the last five or six years at least been a club chairman or the leader of one or more of the clubs of the Communist Party situated in the City of San Francisco?”</text>

            <text syncTime="4741.731" offset="18966883">In the Penfield case she was first -- the witness was first subjected to a criminal fine of $50.</text>

            <text syncTime="4751.784" offset="19007112">And the government appealed from that on the ground that the proceeding -- that the judge had in effect abused his discretion by fining the witnesses $50 and it should have subjected him to a civil sentence of imprisonment until the witness agreed to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4777.039" offset="19108153">The government argued that in the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals agreed and this Court upheld the Court of Appeals, but there the, it was just a reverse of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4790.296" offset="19161130">There the criminal sentence came first and the civil sentence was there after imposed by the appellate court but at two different times.</text>
            <text syncTime="4798.719" offset="19194776">Now here it was just the other way around.</text>
            <text syncTime="4800.184" offset="19200731">Here the civil sentence came first and a criminal sentence came thereafter, but I think that the principle will be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="4809.010" offset="19235944">Now, it is the government's position that there were as many contempts committed as there were persons who were the subject matters of the questions in over this two-day period with one qualification, which I shall mention in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4829.914" offset="19319641">In other words, in these, in this two-day period there were a total of 10 persons concerning whom Mrs. Yates was questioned, two on the first day and eight on the second day and -- Now we agree that if the purpose of these questions was to ask Mr. Yates whether or not she knew any communists at all that all these questions were really in effect a single question, but that was not the purpose of these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.631" offset="19442521">Each of these, each of these questions insofar as they are related to a different person had value in itself and therefore there were as many contempts as there were persons who were the objects of the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4871.893" offset="19487556">Now with this one qualification, five of these questions dealt with codefendants of Mrs. Yates who had rested their cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.634" offset="19530501">Now Mrs. Yates said from the beginning and consistently maintained throughout the two-day period that she would not identify any of her codefendants who had not rested their cases as communists.</text>
            <text syncTime="4895.646" offset="19582537">Now in view of the fact that she was consistent in that position, we believe at least we shall assume for argument that the multiple questions dealing with these several codefendants were in effect one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4911.139" offset="19644500">But there were also these other people about whom she was questioned, who were not codefendants and she answered these questions on a person by person basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4925.173" offset="19700611">Some of the persons she answered about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4927.638" offset="19710537">She answered about a peson named Mike Quinn.</text>
            <text syncTime="4930.605" offset="19722344">She answered about a person named Carl Winter who was one of the – her -- one of the named but unindicted coconspirators.</text>
            <text syncTime="4942.586" offset="19770305">He was one of the Smith Act defendant – the Dennis defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4945.704" offset="19782740">She named William Z Foster.</text>
            <text syncTime="4948.099" offset="19792353">She named a person named Sam Darcy who was a former communist who had been expelled and the rationalization that she presented to the court and to the prosecutor as to why she was asking, why should answer some of these questions and not others was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.932" offset="19863719">“I will answer any questions that you ask me as long as in my opinion, my identification of him as a member of the party cannot hurt him or any member of his family.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4977.280" offset="19909068">It was specifically pointed out to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="4979.856" offset="19919412">“How Mrs. Yates can you hurt someone who is employed by the party.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.576" offset="19934250">And she acknowledged, “You know, well it's true I can't hurt him, but I might hurt some members of his family.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4989.618" offset="19958387">And then in the case of Mike Quinn she said, “Well, I will answer about Mike Quinn.</text>
            <text syncTime="4992.932" offset="19971657">He is dead.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4994.148" offset="19976568">But how about members of, how about members of Mike Quinn's family, well she didn't go into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4999.025" offset="19996003">The net effect to that was she was in the words of the (Inaudible) case, she was arrogating onto herself the function of a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="5007.631" offset="20030485">She was going to decide or at least with respect to these questions on cross-examination, she was going to decide on a person by person basis which person she would answer about and which ones she would not answer about.</text>
            <text syncTime="5018.625" offset="20074475">Now for that reason the government is of the view that each question insofar as it dealt with a different person, with the exception that I mentioned a moment ago about codefendants, forms a basis of a separate contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5033.014" offset="20132049">Now by the basis -- by the use of a little arithmetic that would come down to six contempts, two committed on the first day and four additional ones on the second day.</text>
            <text syncTime="5042.219" offset="20168829">Now since petitioner admits that all you need is two to establish the basis -- to make the criminal sentence valid, that if my reasoning is sound that proves that the criminal contempt sentence was valid on the independent grounds than the one I first mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5071.407" offset="20285544">Now I shall like to come to the petitioner's second point namely that the criminal contempt sentence was misconceived because the purpose of a sentence was not punish Mrs. Yates, but really to coerce her and to give an answer, into giving answers for the benefit of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5095.417" offset="20381571">We think that it is clear from reading the record and the record is very short and particularly the colloquy between the judge and Mrs. Yates and her counsel that his purpose in opposing this second sentence, this criminal sentence of June 30th was to vindicate the authority of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5114.933" offset="20459729">He used that expression at least five times during that colloquy and that is the characteristic purpose of a criminal sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5122.236" offset="20488882">Now it is true that he does speak in terms of I had hope, he said, “I had hoped Mrs. Yates would have purged herself by now.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5131.304" offset="20525140">But it is clear from the context in which he uses that expression that he was using it in the sense of I had hoped that she would by now have bound to the authority of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5143.403" offset="20573518">In other words he was saying that he had, he hoped that by now she would have exhibited some repentance and contrition for her refusal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5155.416" offset="20621584">And he said that if she had done that, he would take that into consideration in reducing the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5162.987" offset="20651886">He referred specifically to Rule 35(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure which authorizes a court within 60 days after the imposition of a criminal sentence to reduce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5173.798" offset="20695144">He referred to that specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="5177.052" offset="20708206">So I think it is clear that the judge's attitude and point of view was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5181.678" offset="20726700">This is a criminal sentence but you have it within your power by answering these questions and thereby exhibiting a repentance and contrition that you bow to the authority of the court and I will take that into consideration in reducing your sentence, possibly suspending, possibly suspending it's execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5200.413" offset="20801620">And for that reason we think that there was no merit to the petitioner's view, contention that the judge really didn't know what he was doing here, that he was really that -- they admit that the sentence would inform a criminal, it was to a definite period which is the hallmark of a criminal sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5221.777" offset="20887092">But they say that the judge didn't really know what he was doing, what he really had in mind was trying to coerce her into giving these answers for the benefit of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5231.831" offset="20927321">In the colloquy it was pointed out to him that it was too late to give these answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5235.774" offset="20942994">The trial was over and he recognized that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5238.030" offset="20952085">He said -- he said I recognize the fact that it's too late for the trial but she can still answer the questions and thereby bow to the authority of the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="5499.712" offset="21998759">Well I think there are either one of two possibilities; one because that original Smith act sentence has been washed out at least as of now, it could be that she will be required to serve the sentence in this case immediately assuming that is affirmed by this Court because the sentence under which it was added just no longer is as of now.</text>
            <text syncTime="5523.255" offset="22093009">Om the other hand a possibly resonable reading of that would be that the judge will because it was with intent to make that sentence run after the Smith Act sentence, he might decide to wait and see what happens at the second trial and if she is again convicted then make this one run consecutively to that future, possibly future sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5548.983" offset="22195931">But in no case, I am sure in no case, would a reasonable reading of that sentence means that it might be washed out entirely.</text>

            <text syncTime="6191.372" offset="24765440">The question of whether or not -- I mean the difference between the Costello Case and this case really has relevance to how many offenses, how many contempts were committed, but it does not follow that because a person only committed one contempt and not five or six; that, that one contempt was less serious than the five or six, but my final point is this, that --</text>

            <text syncTime="6218.617" offset="24874423">Two, one on each day, but you know remember the facts of the Costello Case, he was a witness on two separate days and on each day he refused to answer questions under different circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="6231.275" offset="24925100">There was something about the doctor's certificates and there was -- in anyway it was undisputed that there were at least two offences, but the Court said only two.</text>
            <text syncTime="6240.881" offset="24963448">The offense of each day could not be proliferated by continuing to answer Costello questions and we except that principle, I think that's sound, but that's not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6249.843" offset="24999288">But my final point is that Mrs. Yates by picking and choosing the questions that she would answer, in the words of the (Inaudible) case, she determined what testimony to give and what to withhold, and thereby she transferred from the court to the witness, the management of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6272.741" offset="25090926">I think that, that is an important factor for this Court to keep in mind in determining whether or not one year was too long.</text>
            <text syncTime="6279.951" offset="25119765">In Gompers against Bucks Stove &amp; Range Company, this Court said through Mr. Justice Lamar speaking for unanimous court, if a party can make himself a judge of the validity of orders which have been issued and by his own act of disobedience set them aside, then are the courts impotent and what the constitution now fittingly calls the judicial power of the United States would be a mere mockery.</text>
            <text syncTime="6304.934" offset="25219657">For all these reasons the government submits the sentences are valid and that the one year sentence while reducible by this Court, in its opinion it is too long, was within the range of a sound judicial discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="6338.203" offset="25352777">The Chief Justice asked a question of my opponent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6345.009" offset="25379944">If there -- he had been able to find any cases where a judge attempted to punish both civilly and criminally on whether these cases said that it must happen at the same time (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="6359.325" offset="25437205">The Yates decision, the reversal of the three year sentence in this case which is reported at 227 F.2d 848 says just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6367.966" offset="25471791">The judge had put her in jail civilly where she remained for 43 days and at the conclusion of the trial he said I now treat this as criminal and I'm going to sentence you the three years and the court reversed on the exact basis, that it was a denial of due process for the court to punish civilly and then without giving her warning at that time, that he still held it within his power, he still intended to do something criminally about it, because and this is logical, because if a witness knew at the time that he was being committed civilly, that there was a possibility of a criminal sentence for the same offence it might make an awful deal of difference as to whether or not that witness was going to answer that question or not at that time, and so the Court held that in this case, this very case, that it was the denial of due process to wait until the trial was over.</text>
            <text syncTime="6417.010" offset="25668023">So I say that in this case says, when he first committed her for a civil contempt, assuming that there was only contempt, it was then a denial of due process for having to attempt to sentence her again and the government cannot now come back and say well he could have sentenced her both civilly and criminally and we can't go back and retry what the judge might have done, because he tried to do just that and the court reversed it.</text>

            <text syncTime="6445.453" offset="25781812">Yes and that was the question which I understood the Chief Justice to put to my opponent, whether or not they had to be given notice of that time and the case held that because she wasn't told at that time that she might be punished criminally for the same offense, it was a denial of due process and she was entitled to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6461.725" offset="25846805">And in my final minute let me say this that I think that there is no question about the court having the power to do something about the sentence in this case if it feels that the sentence was excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="6473.207" offset="25892780">In arguing excessiveness of the sentence, I do not waive for one more, my honest and sincere and (Inaudible) belief that there are committed in this case which requires a complete reversal of this conviction without regard to the excessiveness, but failing of that argument I think that in on the basis of precedent, the fact that 30 days and 60 days has been sufficient in every other case of this kind, to vindicate the authority of the court that it was certainly a very great abuse of discretion and it is shocking to the conscience that the court would give a year in this case after she had already spent more that 70 days in jail.</text>

            <text syncTime="6527.949" offset="26111791">It maybe that the business of sentence is purely an administrative process and that the case could go back to the Trial Court for a correction of the sentence from the standpoint of when it is to permit because it maybe that you can argument that this is purely an administrative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="6547.723" offset="26190890">On the other hand it maybe that this is such an integral part of the judgment, that because of the fact that there was reversal in the main case, that the contempt case falls with the main case, I am not prepared to say which of those alternatives is the correct one.</text>
