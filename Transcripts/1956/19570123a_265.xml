            <text syncTime="21.793" offset="190568">This case comes here on a direct appeal from a judgment entered in the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.845" offset="230797">Judge Newman sitting, dismissing an information, charging a violation of 18 U.S.C. 835, a provision of the Criminal Code which relates generally to the safe transportation of explosives by common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.909" offset="322957">I shall come back to the specific language of that statute in a few moments.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.291" offset="348557">The sole ground of the dismissal is stated in a two-sentence memorandum opinion which appears at record 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.818" offset="426611">The -- the ground there stated in brief is that a partnership cannot be held criminally liable.</text>

            <text syncTime="97.984" offset="495261">I think it's fair to state that the decision does not rest on a construction of the particular statutes involved because Judge Newman states, Your Honors will note, that regardless of the wording of the relevant statutes which he cites and despite various cases which he says were cited by the Government dealing with criminal responsibility attaching to unincorporated associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.671" offset="638098">And I'm quoting directly now.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer</label>
            <text syncTime="158.528" offset="737468">Well, he certainly is stating that he is deciding for purposes of this case that there is no jurisdiction, but I think his language that regardless of the wording of the statutes, there is no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.212" offset="792221">Implies that he was troubled by common law of concepts of partnership, which of course are to the effect that a partnership is only an aggregated individuals and has no status as an entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.481" offset="877275">On the question of their power of Congress to provide that a partnership shall be for particular regulatory purposes treated as a person or as an entity, we feel that that is clearly settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.265" offset="948433">We think that Congress were purposes of regulatory statutes may do and has time and again done it in many regulatory statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.317" offset="996603">It may do what some states have done for particular purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.087" offset="1011754">That is to provide that an entity, concept of partnership shall be the prevailing rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.043" offset="1051564">That's most federal regulatory statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.510" offset="1065462">I think it's fair to say contained definition sections which provide that for purposes of the particular regulatory scheme of the word “person” shall include partnership, corporation, association and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.327" offset="1140694">On the question of the power of Congress to do that, the reason that we feel that might as well settled is that this Court, more than 40 years ago, had substantially the same problem before it in the case of United States against Adams Express.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.049" offset="1223555">In that case, the defendant, the Adams Express Company was an unincorporated association.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.494" offset="1253334">It was tried in a criminal proceeding for a misdemeanor, also one relating to transportation, namely, that it had departed from its tariffs on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.187" offset="1324074">Adams' defense in that case was that it was not suable, that it was an association, not -- not a corporation, not an actual person and not reachable sued qua company.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.749" offset="1398366">Justice Holmes, speaking for a unanimous court said that it was inconceivable to the Court that the Interstate Commerce Act was intended in its requirements to reach only common carriers' organized incorporate form and not to reach carriers organized in other form.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.726" offset="1498258">We've quoted from the language of that opinion at page 8 of our opening brief and I'd like to advert to a single sentence of it in which Justice Holmes states, "That the constitutionality of the statute as against corporations is established," citing the Court's earlier New York Central decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.723" offset="1586239">And no reason is suggested why Congress has no equal power to charge the partnership assets with a liability and to personify the company, so far as to collect a fine by proceeding against it by the company name.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.773" offset="1674428">With that background then, let me turn if I may to the particular statutes which are the basis of the indictment or rather the information in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="557.846" offset="2334804">Now, that language which shall be binding upon all carriers is in expressed terms what Justice Holmes was inferring when he stated that Congress certainly must have intended the Interstate Commerce Act to be binding upon all types of carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.443" offset="2425187">The word, "whoever," in the next paragraph where Congress says, “Whoever knowingly violates shall be punished as follows,” is not defined in 18 U.S.C. 835 itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="737.264" offset="3052440">Now, as a matter of enforcement policy, the Government frequently deems it important to proceed against the business because as we conceive it under these regulatory statutes, the primary responsibility for appointing employees with requirements seeing that they observed requirements, supervising, training, policing must necessarily rest upon the heads of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.721" offset="3158288">And as we also think, the very purpose in these regulatory statutes of defining a person to include partnership, association, corporation and so forth is to make the business as such, the heads of the business, responsible for implementing as best as they can, the many regulatory requirements which the regulatory statute may impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.040" offset="3271555">But we state quite frankly to this Court as we did below that we were preceding against the partnership because we didn't think that we could prove a case against the individual partners, but thought that the sanction should run against the business in the event that this -- that this charged violations of state deregulation were approved to have taken place.</text>

            <text syncTime="968.613" offset="3977801">Now, I think it is also relevant in dealing with the question whether Congress meant as we think its language quite clearly imports to create a partnership as a responsible entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.682" offset="4054079">It's relevant to look at what the Interstate Commerce Act generally provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.162" offset="4076022">It is I think a historical accident that this particular provision relating to the transportation of explosives appears in the Criminal Code rather than in the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.754" offset="4130356">The reason for it is that Congress, as early as 1866, first became concerned about the transportation of explosives and attached the statute in that year relating to the carriage of T.N.T. by vessels which also carry passengers for hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.015" offset="4207470">So, Congress dealt with this subject long before there was an Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.089" offset="4227741">And the successor statutes relating to the same subject of transportation by -- of explosives by common carriers have all followed the manner and the mold of the first statute, though the more reason statutes delegate the matter of prescribing the standards to the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.550" offset="4325543">Now, of course, the Interstate Commerce Act imposes a multitude of requirements upon carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.401" offset="4353024">For many of -- many of these requirements have penalties attached in the event of violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.763" offset="4378415">In addition, the Commerce Act provides for criminal penalties in the event of a failure to obey any lawful regulation of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.042" offset="4427525">Now, all of those offenses, all of those criminal offenses under the Interstate Commerce Act similarly used the words "knowingly" and "willfully."</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.769" offset="4466500">Moreover, the Interstate Commerce Act and its prohibitions run against any person subject to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.253" offset="4500355">Finally, the Interstate Commerce Act defines a person and it defines a person in precisely the same way that 1 U.S.C. 1 does or at least substantially so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.190" offset="4552182">The language of the Commerce Act, the motor carrier provision is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.100" offset="4595754">Person includes any individual, firm, co-partnership, company, association or joint stock association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.769" offset="4630444">Now, as the result of this, the Government has regularly proceeded in cases involving other interstate commerce regulations against all types of carriers however they may be happening and however they may be organized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.576" offset="4693661">We've cited in a reply brief, a very large number of unreported cases involving both prosecutions under the Interstate Commerce Act and under many other regulatory statutes in which the Government has successfully proceeded against partnership entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.948" offset="4767117">There is only one case that we know of in which the precise question raised here was presented and resulted in the writing of an opinion on the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.092" offset="4811734">That was an opinion by the Ninth Circuit in a case called Evans Packing Company against United States which -- from which we've quoted in our replied brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.543" offset="4849560">That too supports the position we are urging.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.845" offset="4866800">In that case, the Government had charged violations of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and it had preceded both against to the partnership and against certain name of partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.172" offset="4924061">The District Court imposed fines on the partnership and upon the individual partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.045" offset="4951542">On appeal, it was urged that this was duplication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.067" offset="4967633">The Court of Appeals said that since the statute in question made the partnership a separate person that the partnership as such was subject to a fine irrespective of whether a fine was imposed upon any individual partner or partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.991" offset="5051329">Not uncommonly, the Government does proceed against a partnership and an individual partner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.234" offset="5084348">The typical case is the situation we have in enforcing the Food and Drug Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.911" offset="5115068">If the violator is a retail drug partnership, invariably, the Government names the partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.593" offset="5149759">It is also the Government's regular practice to name the individual performance test who is implicated in the particular Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.972" offset="5191241">If he happens to be a partner as he's not in frequently the case, he is individually named.</text>

            <text syncTime="1423.038" offset="5795506">Well, of course the -- the regulatory purpose we think that Congress has in mind when in characteristically defines person to include partnerships for purposes of a particular Act is to enable the Government to impose sanctions upon the business as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.332" offset="5864678">We think the philosophy of it is that here is a business affected with a particular public interest and regulation and the impact of regulation should not depend upon a particular form in which the company has organized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.958" offset="5935208">Our concern is to be able to proceed against the business assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.733" offset="5954330">Now, whether a fine upon a business could be collected against the individual that the business assets were not sufficient to satisfy, may be a naughty question but as I say, it's one that perhaps fortunately has not yet arisen.</text>

            <text syncTime="1542.312" offset="6272606">Well, the heart of this statute, 18 U.S.C. 835, a statute which is part of the Criminal Code is certainly to impose penalties and Congress has said in that very statute and this is the context now that it shall be binding upon all common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.101" offset="6339793">Now, I think it's also fair to consider as context, the whole scheme of regulation of carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.999" offset="6363408">And in that connection, I've tried to point out that all of the statutory requirements, all of the regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission, all of those are for knowing unwillful violation in terms and then the Interstate Commerce Act began.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.245" offset="6432371">Congress has defined a person to include partnerships as well as other forms of business organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.895" offset="6466957">Now, appellee argues that the notion of vicarious criminal liability is one not favored, and we certainly agree where the true crime case is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.939" offset="6523173">But the purpose of regulatory Acts like these is not to single out that individual and to say, “This is inherently criminal conduct for which society must punish and correct.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.011" offset="6583463">The purpose of statutes like this is certainly to safeguard the public and we think -- in order to do that effectively, it is reasonable for Congress to say that the sanction shall be imposed upon the business and may be imposed upon the business as well as against particular individual violators, employees of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.792" offset="6698506">Professor Sayer has -- and discussed this entire problem of criminal responsibility for Acts of another in a noted treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.334" offset="6748662">And he stated at his conclusion, a sentence which is the heart of our position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.138" offset="6779904">“As long as courts,” he says “are careful not to commit respondeat superior to creep into the true crime cases, masters and principles should be held criminally liable for the petty misdemeanors of their servants and agents, which involved no moral delinquency or severe punishment and which are committed in the course of the master's business.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.279" offset="6876453">Now, of course we're an entity as the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.386" offset="6884916">The punishment is necessarily limited to a fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.137" offset="6903933">In some, the consequence of te view we urge is that some sanction may be imposed upon those who are in charge of a business which is affected with the public interest, those who are in the best position to prevent violations before they occur.</text>

            <label>Mr. Attorney General</label>
            <text syncTime="1732.861" offset="7034859">If the Court pleases, the Government originally filed a criminal information against Foreman and Wrestler doing business as American Freightways Company, a New York partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.615" offset="7137782">Now I'm expressing the way New York had because it becomes important in consideration of this particular case with a violation of central regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission pertaining to the transportation of a corrosive liquid not explosive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.780" offset="7222523">And I emphasize the way corrosive liquid because it was caustic pottage and that comes into consideration in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.909" offset="7274977">It was a single shipment on March 3rd, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.594" offset="7301726">And if that happened as the Government contends it happened, it would have been a violation under the Criminal Code, which was titled 18 U.S.C., Section 835.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.644" offset="7377899">When this matter came to trial before Judge Bicks in the Southern District of New York, he permitted the Government to read into the record in the nature of a proper approved, a bill of particulars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.601" offset="7489808">In this bill of particulars, the Government outlined its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.640" offset="7517915">It set forth the names of its witnesses, what each one would prove, what each one would testify to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.539" offset="7561488">And at the end of that, the Government stated that they would not attempt to prove that the partners had knowledge of this particular shipment, but that they would rely upon the sum knowledge of the employees and imputes that knowledge to the partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.655" offset="7669948">It appeared to counsel for the defendants at that time that if the statement of the Government was accepted, that at the most that the Government could establish was some negligence on the part of an employee and nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.732" offset="7770258">And so, a motion was made to dismiss the original information upon various grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.568" offset="7801605">One, that the information was pleaded not as required by the statute which was knowing violation of the statute, but it pleaded a public welfare or malum prohibitum statute which was not before the Court, wherein probable intent or knowledge was not part of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.598" offset="7921768">Secondly, that knowledge could not be imputed to the individuals and before any discussion could be held upon the various points, that the Court picked up immediately, this point of imputing knowledge to the individuals and based solely upon that particular point, dismissed the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.837" offset="8050709">Now, in dismissing that information, the Court passed upon -- discussed two cases, the first one was Boyce Motor Lines against the United States, which is a report in 342 U.S. in which this Court had before it, this very statute under consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.995" offset="8131375">And the Court there indicated that knowledge on the part of a defendant is an essential element of the crime under Section 835 because the statute punishes only those who knowingly violate the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.706" offset="8210160">And then, the Court referred to a second decision and that was Gordon against the United States, which was on all force with the case before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.848" offset="8262719">In that case also, there was involved the -- the knowing violation of a regulation under the War Production Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.204" offset="8332204">And the Court, the District Court charged that the individual -- that the partners that knowledge of the agent may be imputed to the individual partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.237" offset="8412348">In that statute, Your Honor, Your Honors, there was even a definition directly in the statute which stated that pacing shall include individuals, corporations, partners, associations, their agents, their representative, their successors and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.417" offset="8497089">And despite that definition, this Court in 347 U.S. ultimately revised the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals and held that it cannot impute knowledge to these individuals, even in these regulatory statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.610" offset="8593847">And so, the Government filed a notice of appeal and while that appeal was pending and by the way, that appeal has never been withdrawn and it is still pending, they handed down another information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.611" offset="8673782">This time, by the mere juxtaposition of the names, they created a new information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.237" offset="8716309">Now, instead of it being directed again to two individuals doing business as the co-partnership, they now have the partnership consisting of the two individuals, the two partners that comprise it so that the partners as well as the partnership entity if they -- as they refer to it are before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.584" offset="8841697">And at this point, I'd like to emphasize the fact that if this partnership, if -- if there was conviction in this case, these individuals would be indelibly stamped with the conviction as though they were named separately and distinctly from those of the partnership, from that of the partnership without having the benefits of a trial or the right to come before the Court and testify that they had no knowledge of the act of these -- of an agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.783" offset="8978474">But when this second information was handed down, we then made a motion in the District Court before the case came to trial, to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.801" offset="9034585">At this time, upon the ground that the information was insufficient to law and that there was double jeopardy, that there was an appeal pending and that a partnership and criminal law cannot be considered as a separate entity as distinct from the partners that comprise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.594" offset="9141791">Now, the Government in this affidavit submitted in our position to this particular motion, stated in a -- stated that it would be willing to submit an all bill of particulars exactly the same as the bill of particulars that it had submitted in connection with the information directed against the individual partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.136" offset="9239907">They raise the same question of 1 U.S.C. 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.033" offset="9255476">They introduced these cases involving unincorporated associations and they relied most heavily on the Adams Express Company case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.549" offset="9305527">The subject was brief and argued before Judge Newman and Judge Newman held -- dismissed the information and held that a partnership is not a separate entity for the purposes of criminal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.751" offset="9386402">That the partners themselves are the one that may be punished for the crimes that they commit or that -- or committed by the partnership with their knowledge or consent or approval.</text>

            <text syncTime="2352.790" offset="9514506">Now, what does the -- the Government then filed a notice of appeal from that decision to the Circuit Court of Appeals and while that appeal was pending, they filed a third notice of appeal to this Court and this Court noted probable jurisdiction because under Section 3731, there is a question of an interpretation of Section 835 of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.243" offset="9620355">Now, what is the Government trying to establish here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.847" offset="9634774">They're trying to have this Court phase rule in connection with this New York partnership that the -- in criminal law, a partnership is a separate entity, separate -- a distinct entity separate and apart from the partners that comprise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.213" offset="9700185">Number two, they say to Your Honors, we -- we say under this case impute knowledge to the partners or -- I withdraw that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.522" offset="9765491">They like to apply the principle which is only -- which has only been applied up to now to corporations of vicarious liabilities to that other partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.698" offset="9818154">That's where they stopped, but this Court can't stop there because they still have another consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.489" offset="9849292">The statute here says, “Whoever knowingly shall violate,” so that this Court must go further and fine that even though the statute says, “whoever knowingly violates,” that you can still impute criminal liability, knowledge and whole pacing is criminally liable even though they do not have knowledge of a particular violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.269" offset="9980426">That's if the Court agrees with the Government on the first two propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.307" offset="10004564">And in that respect, I have very great doubts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.005" offset="10019401">Now, under the -- I'd like to take, to consider first the first proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.757" offset="10058376">Is a partnership a separate entity for the purposes of criminal liability?</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.369" offset="10088887">Now, the Government in its briefs have mentioned some federal rules, civil procedure and a section of the Bankruptcy Act and cited some cases on unincorporated associations on the Adams Express Company case to support their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.455" offset="10185226">Now, if the Court pleases, the common law of theory, the common law is based upon the aggregate rather than the entity theory of the nature of a partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.359" offset="10252831">The uniform partnership law of the State of New York is based upon the common law theory and the -- this statute -- this -- the -- the uniform partnership law has come under consideration before various courts, including the Court of Appeals of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.491" offset="10357321">And the Court of Appeals of the State of New York in the case of Kaplan against Kaplan stated that a partnership is not like a corporation, an artificial person created by law and existing independent of the persons who created and control it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.531" offset="10457527">A partnership merely has a name by which individuals conduct a joint business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.888" offset="10502875">In law, it is not a separate entity even if it appears to have some attributes of a separate entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.698" offset="10542164">It carries on business as co-owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.218" offset="10572257">And in the most recent case, Williams against Hartshorn reported in 296 New York at page 49, the Court -- the Court of Appeals of the State of New York in referring to a partnership also said that a partnership is not to be regarded as a separate entity distinct from the persons who composed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.677" offset="10682075">Now, even the federal courts have considered this statute, this New York statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.223" offset="10708302">And on one case, Helvering against Smith, Judge Learned Hand in discussing the Uniform Partnership Act of the State of New York said that a partnership is not an independent juristic entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.172" offset="10780087">Well, there came a time when the -- when the State of New York, the legislature said that a partnership may be sued in the partnership made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.375" offset="10824913">And the Rule 17 (b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, I think it was patterned after that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.330" offset="10864724">And thereto, they committed a partnership to be sued in the partnership name.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.082" offset="10895653">And the question is to whether or not that affected the partnership theory or that the aggregate partnership's theory and change it into a separate entity.</text>
