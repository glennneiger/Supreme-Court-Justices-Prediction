            <text syncTime="46.872" offset="290879">During the argument by Mr. Levy yesterday, there were some pertinent questions asked by embers of the Court in regard to the procedure used in Kansas, an imminent domain proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.349" offset="360782">Mr. Levy of New York apparently is not too well acquainted with our condemnation law in Kansas and so I would like to briefly outline to the Court the manner in which we have for the last 40 or more years condemned property in Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.057" offset="459630">The statute which is under consideration now was enacted in 1913 and although it may not be horrid by Eastern standards, it, at least is venerable by our Kansas standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.791" offset="526503">There -- this statute has been used by, not only cities but by counties, by townships, by school boards, by the State of Kansas, in other words, by any governmental unit that condemns land in Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.491" offset="601318">I would not estimate how many pieces of property have been condemned for public purposes under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.355" offset="636844">Greatly, this is the way it works.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.205" offset="652204">The procedural statute requires that the city passed a resolution finding that it is necessary to condemn certain land for public purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.073" offset="695672">In this case, it was for the purpose of widening a street.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.350" offset="716779">This resolution directs the city engineer to prepare the description of the land and a survey of the same that is necessary for this condemnation and present the same to the City Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.254" offset="776338">This resolution is published in the official city paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.987" offset="795355">At the following meeting, we incidentally have a meeting every Friday morning, as required by law, at the following meeting, this description from the engineer of the land necessary to be -- be condemned as presented to the City Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.847" offset="862751">The City Commission then instructs me as city attorney to prepare an ordinance declaring it necessary to condemn this land for public purpose, which I had been due and this ordinance is read twice as required by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.336" offset="916668">It's been on first reading at one meeting and passed at the following meeting assuming that the Commission desires to pass it.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.097" offset="951777">The ordinance is then published on the official city paper as required by law and this ordinance passed by as the land to be condemned and the purpose for which it is condemned that specifies the voids that has been read from the street that is going to be condemned.</text>
