            <label>Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal</label>
            <text syncTime="18.038" offset="175522">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.372" offset="184822">This case is hereon writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.210" offset="208227">The single issue presented is whether a federal per diem employees and federal -- a per diem employee is one whose rate of compensation is fixed on a piece-work, daily or hourly basis, rather than on an annual basis, are entitled to an extra day's compensation as a gratuity for work on holidays during World War II which were regular workdays for all federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.339" offset="340720">The background of this litigation comes down to this, by two presidential directives during 1943, all normally observed peace-time holidays with the exemption of Christmas were designated as regular workdays for the balance of the war in the interest of obtaining maximum output in governmental activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.392" offset="444897">For the duration of the law, therefore, all federal employees, per annum workers and per diem workers alike, worked on these days just as on other days in the work week.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.798" offset="502575">For this work, per annum employees receive no additional compensation and per diem employees receive their regular rate of pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.035" offset="547506">Now, the respondent in this case, Mr. Bergh, was one of these per diem workers, an employee of the Department of the Navy at the shipyard at Portsmouth, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.107" offset="595780">Pursuant to the previously mentioned directives, respondent and common with all federal employees worked on New Year's Day, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day and July 4 in the year 1945 just as on other days in the work week.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.654" offset="681984">For this work, and we think it's important to note this, the respondent was paid his regular wages plus any overtime or night differential that he was entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.723" offset="730258">By this action, filed some seven years after his work was performed, the respondent seeks an additional day's pay as a gratuity for working on these days which we emphasized again were regular workdays for all federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.142" offset="807894">His claim is that while concededly the largest class of government employee, the per annum worker, was not entitled to the gratuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.947" offset="851153">The class of which he is a representative, the per diem worker, is entitled to this gratuity which the General Accounting Office estimates will aggregate somewhere perhaps in the neighborhood of $750 million.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal</label>
            <text syncTime="248.998" offset="1099316">That's right because the respondent in this case was in the service from 1946 to 1948 and under the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act, the limitation period did not run while he was in service.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.934" offset="1147068">There's no question about this suit being tardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.926" offset="1159084">Now, at the very outset, we think it's important to note that the payment of a gratuity, and that's what this is, this claim, to a federal employee must have its roots in a federal statute which either expressly provides for the gratuity in the particular circumstances or in the alternative confers permissive discretion upon the employing agency to pay the gratuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.677" offset="1274128">Now, here, we can, at the very outset, lay aside the matter of permissive discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.190" offset="1300146">It may be that under the Act of July 16, 1862, set forth in the Government's brief at page 3, conferring authority upon the Secretary of the Navy to promulgate rates of wages, it may be that under that Act, the Secretary of the Navy had the discretion to award gratuity pay to these employees for working on these days which at the time were normal wok days.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.289" offset="1404531">But the plain fact is that if he had that discretion, he did not exercise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.504" offset="1425429">This respondent's employment was governed by a schedule of wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.496" offset="1441311">The schedule of wages is explicit on the matter of its compensation for holiday work.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.017" offset="1463463">It provides that for that work, he is to receive his regular rate of pay, plus of course overtime or night differential allowances.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.600" offset="1497736">The schedule of wages provides that he is to get gratuity pay only if he is unable to work on the particular holiday, relieved or prevented from working on the holiday and thus cannot earn his normal day's pay.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal</label>
            <text syncTime="366.853" offset="1570774">It says that he can't get it then but it says that with respect to the days upon which he -- he works, he is to be allowed his regular pay plus a premium of 50% if the holiday falls without his normal work week.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.341" offset="1624691">Now, these holidays fell within this employee's normal work week.</text>

          <turn speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="388.102" stopTime="648.420">
            <label>Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal</label>
            <text syncTime="388.102" offset="1655829">That's -- that's right but the -- but the -- the schedule of wages did not specifically authorize this and the respondent has not contended at any point in this case that the schedule of wages here conferred an entitlement upon the respondent to this gratuity for holiday work.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.085" offset="1735764">So that the question comes down to whether in 1943 -- or in 1945 rather, there was a mandatory statutory requirement that per diem employees were to be given a gratuity above and beyond their normal compensation for working on days which were for all federal employees regular workdays as to this matter that we now turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.757" offset="1846418">The history of legislation on the subject of holiday gratuity pay for per diem workers goes back to 1880.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.621" offset="1877870">Prior to that time, the per diem worker was not paid on days in which no work was performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.653" offset="1905977">As a consequence, when a holiday intervened and the employee was prevented from work, his paycheck was reduced accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.817" offset="1946624">This was not so to the per annum worker, his salary has traditionally been regarded as payment for everyday of the year whether a workday or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.011" offset="1979434">Consequently, when he was excused from work, this had no effect at all upon his paycheck.He received the same amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.803" offset="2010572">Now, by a Resolution of 1880, limited in its application to the Government Printing Office and the Resolution of January 6, 1885, which had general applicability to per diem employees, Congress had vested itself to this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.974" offset="2071280">It allowed, by these Resolutions, certain specified days as holidays with the same pay as on other days.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.737" offset="2110360">And as the legislative history of these Resolutions show, which is set forth in 18 and 19 of the Government's brief, the single purpose of these Resolutions was to equate the position of the per diem and per annum worker that, henceforth, the occurrence of a holiday with non-occasional reduction in the per diem workers paycheck anymore than did in the per annum worker's paycheck.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.930" offset="2203042">Now, despite the fact that this was the sole purpose of this Resolution insofar as the legislative history reflects, the 1885 Resolution was administratively interpreted by the Comptroller of the of the Treasury and then by the Comptroller General as meaning that when the per diem worker worked on the holiday and thus was able to obtain his regular wages, he nevertheless was entitled to this gratuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.530" offset="2313488">In short, under this interpretation, the per diem employee was placed in this preferential position, the per annum worker worked in the holiday, no additional compensation, the per diem worker worked on the holiday, he got his regular wages, he got his gratuity as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.896" offset="2374928">Now, this situation, which as I say, resulted from his interpretation of the accounting officials of the Government lasted until the 1930s.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.754" offset="2410350">On December 7, 1937, the President issued an Executive Order closing down the Government establishment from the day before Christmas, December 24th, and excusing all employees from work.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.932" offset="2459146">Now, this Executive Order had no effect at all upon the per annum worker unless he's paid.But December 24th wasn't one of the days specified in the 1885 Resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.163" offset="2503973">Accordingly, the per diem worker was excused from work and couldn't work because his establishment was closed, received no additional compensation, received no compensation, as a matter of fact, at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.568" offset="2549635">Accordingly, a resolution was introduced into the House of Representatives which would have had the effect of allowing compensation to those per diem workers by way of a gratuity, to those per diem workers who had been -- who had lost wages by the result of this Executive Order, in other words, who hadn't worked on December 24th.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.660" offset="2634062">There was nothing in this Resolution to the effect that if the per diem worker had worked on December 24th and thus had been able to obtain his regular wages, he was to get additional day's pay as a gratuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.023" offset="2691427">Now, this Resolution was referred --</text>

            <text syncTime="1204.760" offset="4922389">It wasn't until 1943, at least, and maybe later, that this problem, this claim, the double compensation for holiday work arose, and then, of course, only because of this presidential directives declaring these days regular working days for all federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.568" offset="5001592">And we must stress again that what the respondent has here is no more than this administrative interpretation of the 1885 Resolution by the Comptroller General and in placing total alliance upon that administrative interpretation, he, at the same time, says that the interpretation of the Comptroller General of the 1938 Resolution has eliminated this administrative practice is all wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="1421.683" offset="5790072">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.548" offset="5801566">The 1885 Resolution of Congress, which is the basis for the respondent's claim in this case, has as this Court observed in Kelly when the matter was first before it then applied and construe it for over 40 years prior to the 1938 Resolution on which the Government relies to require a holiday allowance for per diem governmental employees, the per diem employees, roughly, the blue collar employees of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.262" offset="5920371">Now, this -- this holiday allowance has no relation to whether the individual actually worked or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.346" offset="5944717">It's -- it is a gratuity, as the Government claim, payable on the occurrence of the holiday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.496" offset="5977318">If the individual happens to work on a holiday, he is to be paid at his regular compensation which was done here, straight time and of course no claim is being made for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.701" offset="6018173">The reason for the allowance of a holiday gratuity by the Congress had been explained somewhat by counsel for the Government in the case of where the employee does not work on the holiday, for the per diem employee who does not work on a holiday, it was to equalize him with the per annum -- per annum employee who was paid even though he did not work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.911" offset="6106990">In the case where the employee did work on a holiday, it would to compensate him for the extra burden he was put to in giving up his -- a day usually devoted to either religious devotions or patriotic observance or recreation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.682" offset="6174072">Now, the sole question in -- in this case is whether that 1885 Resolution on which we rely entirely has been repealed by the 1938 Resolution insofar as the 1885 Resolution does allow the holiday gratuity and has about four years prior to the 1938 Resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.065" offset="6263620">The entire question has been submitted and argued twice before the Court of Claims and twice the issue has been resolved against the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.092" offset="6299773">It was here in Kelly, but in Kelly, this Court decided the case on a different basis, namely, the particular contract involved there between the Government employee, the Printing Office employee and the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.008" offset="6351391">Here, we have no such contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.947" offset="6359124">We rely solely on the 1885 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.621" offset="6377827">Now, one would suppose that if Congress really intended to overturn or repeal so deeply embedded a -- in longstanding, a practice of holiday allowances, it would have done so in response to complaints or criticism of the practice or it was made of some study or consideration of the questions involved and certainly, that have -- would have used very clear and precise language in repealing that long -- low established practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.952" offset="6499140">Yet, exactly, the opposite is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.287" offset="6512515">The congressional history, as I will show shortly in little more detail, contains that solely with no complaints of criticism, no suggestions that the -- the holiday allowance to the per diem -- per diem employee was in anyway unjust or inequitable or too expensive or for any reason whatsoever should be abolished and there was no discussion of the problem in that entire history and there is no language of repeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2912.819" offset="11754663">The per annum employee has other benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.439" offset="11765112">Many of the benefits, we set forth some of them in our brief which the per diem employee does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.218" offset="11784234">He doesn't have the hazards of employment principle that the per diem blue collar worker does.</text>

            <text syncTime="2927.802" offset="11814536">His job stopped when the work is ended, when the picker's job is unresolved, sort of differences between the two classes testifying a difference in that particular respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.972" offset="11851212">And as I said, no complaint ever was made or no objection raised because of that differential between per annum and governmental.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.572" offset="11881618">But getting back to this legislative history for just a minute, as I said before there is no mention of whatsoever in that legislative history in the report or in any discussion on the floor that anyone was complaining on the side that they're making any objection to this practice of paying a per diem employee a holiday allowance in addition to his regular work when he did work on -- actually work on a holiday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.998" offset="11991333">There is not a word of complaint about that practice which the Government claims has been repealed and which Congress intended to repeal in 1938, not a word on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.711" offset="12030203">The only word that -- a complaint that we do find is in respect to this business of calling or -- or paying a per diem employee for a holiday -- on a holiday when he wasn't called to work, when he wouldn't been -- been called to work in any event because that was a Saturday or a Sunday or some other day of nonworking day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.022" offset="12107421">There was a complaint about that in the -- in a letter written by the Comptroller or in a -- in a letter written by the Comptroller which was given to the House Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.804" offset="12150575">But that is the only practice of which there was any complaint at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.230" offset="12168338">Now, it doesn't seem -- it doesn't seem reasonable that Congress would actually had intended -- actually had or was intending to repeal all aspects of holiday pay as contended for by the Government except the single situation of where an employee is prevented from working solely because of the occurrence of the holiday without some discussions in Congress or complaints being made or -- or objection was being made for the other practices without a little more of studies and was given to that problem and certainly without very express and explicit language to that effect but the manner on which -- which the Government reads the 1938 Resolution would incorporate the word "only" into that Resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.328" offset="12380662">In other words, that a holiday allowance is payable only in as one situation covered by the 1938 Resolution, yet the word "only" that it nowhere -- does not anywhere appear in the 1938 Resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.254" offset="12428413">In other words, if Congress actually intended to repeal that 40 years practice of paying a per diem employee, a holiday allowance and a holiday work, it could very easily have done so by expressed clear language yet such language is utterly liking in -- in the 1938 Resolution and even repeal or cause doesn't repeal the 1885 law in so many words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.675" offset="12530082">I've mentioned the analogies that would -- results where the -- where the Government's contentions followed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.087" offset="12559757">One final point, the Government argues that the 1938 Resolution should be considered -- considered in the light of the fact that in 1943, the President had said that federal employees work on all of the holidays except Christmas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.117" offset="12627884">Well, I don't -- I don't see what possible relevance -- what the President did in 1943, five years after the 1938 Resolution was before Congress, can have in throwing light of the -- the intent of Congress was five years earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.465" offset="12685249">It has, to my mind, absolutely nothing to do with this case which -- to which we're trying to file what the intent of Congress was in 1938.In the wartime, policies in 1943 or 1945, in six or seven years later, have no relevance or give us no help at all on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.385" offset="12764871">As a matter of fact, the -- the wartime policy resolution of the President did not say the employee should not be paid whatever he was actually should be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.991" offset="12803323">I merely said that the holidays was to be considered a working day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.309" offset="12820564">And as stated by the court below, if the Government required the assistance of the per diem employees, it should pay up the rate set forth by the statutes, just as in private industry, employees were paid premium pays or paid for work on holidays even during the wartime.</text>

            <text syncTime="3373.961" offset="13599222">Now, certainly, there is at least an inconsistency between these two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.391" offset="13616985">The 1885 Resolution, as interpreted administratively, required double compensation that the employee worked on a holiday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.383" offset="13648854">The 1938 Resolution, in terms, requires gratuity pay, only if the employee is relieved or prevented from working on the holiday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.569" offset="13685635">Now, with respect to the -- the matter of the Kelly case, we see absolutely no inconsistency between our position here and the course holding in Kelly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.940" offset="13731088">We have never suggested that the 1938 Resolution constituted an absolute bar against contracts providing for gratuity pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.583" offset="13769749">Indeed, at the very outset of my argument, I attempted to make it clear that our position is, that there must be either a statute creating a permissive discretion upon the agency which there was in the -- in the Kelly case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.450" offset="13821158">It was the statute of 1924 which gave authority to the public printer to enter into these contracts, or else, there must be a statute which actually requires it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.182" offset="13864103">Now, in this case, there's no aspect to permissive discretion at all, but this claim is based upon as a must-be upon our being a statute granting absolute entitlement to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.340" offset="13904750">Now, we again call this Court's attention to the fact that after the 1938 Resolution was enacted, it was uniformly construed until this wartime situation arose as eliminating this practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.473" offset="13957308">It was construed by the same official, the Comptroller General, who had set out this administrative practice which forms the sole basis for the respondents' claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.922" offset="13999104">Now, with respect to the absurdity of paying a man the same amount whether he works or whether he doesn't work, as was pointed out by the Court, this is a situation as pertained with the per annum worker and until 1945 Congress did not see that to make any change.</text>

            <text syncTime="3507.391" offset="14132955">None of them applied to the employee who had worked on that specific day.</text>

            <text syncTime="3559.865" offset="14342875">The Congress in 1938 has its attention called to that Resolution and to these preferences and discriminations that arose thereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.941" offset="14379133">And then, they came forth with this 1938 Resolution which provides that gratuity pay when the employee is relieved or prevented from working on that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.041" offset="14411525">And then in Section 2 they say to the extent, inconsistent or in conflict, the 1885 Resolution rather and all other resolutions are hereby repealed.</text>
