            <label>Mr. Daniel H. Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="28.145" offset="215960">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.208" offset="244172">This Court is granted certiorari in a criminal case from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.511" offset="281370">Once again, we are confronted with the problem to the law of conspiracy, a federal criminal conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.669" offset="318046">The petitioner, Orlando Delli Paoli, and somewhere along the line, his name was shorten by certain references to the -- to Paoli but his last name is Delli Paoli, it's a double name.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.477" offset="377292">He was indicted together with four codefendants on a charge as to him of conspiracy to violate the alcohol tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.691" offset="426088">Two of the codefendants were charged in substantive counts, alleging possession or purchasing transportation of illicit alcohol.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.961" offset="487215">The facts of the case show that commencing in December 1949, the activities of the defendants with the exemption of the defendants King and Whitley who were determined only to be purchases of illicit alcohol, the activities of the other three defendants, namely, Delli Paoli, a man named Pierro, and another man named Margiasso, were under surveillance by agents of the Alcohol Tax Unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.401" offset="629008">The evidence in the record discloses that over two-year period, the activities of these defendants were under intermittent observation by the agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.433" offset="681148">Now, actually, I've gone to through the record and I've counted 10 specific dates under which the activities of these men were being observed.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.315" offset="728586">It was a surreptitious observation in the type that it is to be expected when a case of this kind is being made.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.312" offset="776652">The facts disclosed that Pierro purchased a house in the section of the Bronx, New York, in the name of his sister.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.353" offset="828792">First, he went to look at this house and that his two close friends, Delli Paoli and Margiasso, who were his constant companions went with him, they looked at the house, they discussed it with the owner, although, there's nothing to show that anyone except Pierro ever had any of the negotiations for the purchase of the house or ever participated, and at least, Delli Paoli did not participate in negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.788" offset="942477">They saw this house and had a garage next to it, and subsequently, the house was purchased.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.149" offset="971943">And then, intermittently, during the next year and a half, the house was purchased in the spring of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.966" offset="1003186">The agents would, at no particular time, come around and watch these people, watch their comings and goings.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.161" offset="1039966">They observed that the repairs were made to the garage there.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.497" offset="1057311">That glass windows were taken out of the doors and substituted with blank wooden boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.773" offset="1090435">They observed that they bought some trucks and that the trucks were painted, and subsequently, it was determined on the trial that these trucks were registered in fictitious names.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.838" offset="1138709">At various times, it was observed that these people had meetings at various places.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.868" offset="1162846">Nothing conclusive was ever established about any of these meetings or about any of these comings and goings by these different people.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.947" offset="1211120">Finally, in the fall of 1951, the surveillance became intensified and we have testimony of an increase in activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.178" offset="1264097">All neighbors also testify that the -- they heard activity at night in the vicinity of this house and -- and truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.576" offset="1301713">I will say that a woman who lived at the house was introduced to a neighbor who testified on the trial as a cousin of Delli Paoli.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.992" offset="1339329">A relative of Pierro has also lived at this house after some time.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.959" offset="1367228">I will say that all of this evidence that went before the jury is laying a foundation for what ultimately happened on December 28, 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.430" offset="1413099">Now, starting with about the fourth day of December, I'm going to advert, for a moment or two, to some of the kind of observation which were held in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.175" offset="1464090">And all of this, to me, is important because it has background for what ultimately developed on the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.663" offset="1490004">On December 4, 1951, Agent Silvers of the Alcohol Tax Unit testified to the effect that he was observing the garage.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.579" offset="1533680">The garage were ultimately 153 cans of illicit alcohol was found and as Delli Paoli came to the garage and opened the doors, and this was in broad daylight, at that precise moment, the agent seized these observations and left the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.717" offset="1606196">No reason was attributed for why this course of conduct in the part of the agent happened but he was looking into the garage, ostensibly, he saw nothing because he related nothing as to what happened once the garage doors were opened and then immediately, he departed the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.992" offset="1675368">On December 18th, at the other important location in this case, a service station which the Government characterizes as a "switch point" for the transfer of the illicit alcohol which was being delivered to the purchases that a -- a car which is characterized as being heavily laden was driven away by two unknown men.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.582" offset="1769723">I suppose the inferences that this car contained illicit alcohol, but we will never know because the car was never apprehended and is never stopped, this is some sort of the type of evidence which went before this jury during a trial which lasted eight full trial days.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.891" offset="1862928">Finally, we come --</text>
