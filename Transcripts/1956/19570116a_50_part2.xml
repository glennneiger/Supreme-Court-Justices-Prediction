            <label>Mr. Charles P. Scully</label>
            <text syncTime="37.100" offset="251800">-- if -- if I say if I may then, I -- I perhaps should go back to the argument that I thought we had concluded with respect to the no man's land and attempt to point out that with respect, for example, with the State of California where we have no statutory provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.925" offset="339048">We have a court coming in to apply a federal statute without any administrative procedures of any kind and with a very serious question existing as to whether or not the federal law could compel the State as part of this judicial operation in that field to apply administrative procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.337" offset="420760">And then they would apply in that field a law which is consistent neither with the state law nor with the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.064" offset="479587">And so we submit that instead of their being a no man's land because of a declination and a refusal of the States to enter sure of a -- session agreement that it will create just the opposite result and we think the Garmon case is classic for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.498" offset="549386">Namely, that the considered judgment of Congress in enacting the Taft-Hartley law and its predecessor was to have a national uniform policy in which public rights would be enforced and in which the entrée by means of private suits for injunctions would be eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.829" offset="646666">To ensure that, they established the mean for an expert Board with extensive procedures to handle administratively what a court would neither have the -- the time nor the staff to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.829" offset="714689">And in order to have a uniform national standard, it is our argument under 10 (a) that they said to the state agencies, “We will cover the field of industrial relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.645" offset="777906">We invite you to participate, but we invite you to participate on conditions which will ensure that the application at the state level will be substantially identical with that at the national level.”</text>
            <text syncTime="183.988" offset="839346">And if you do not adopt that construction of 10 (a), then as this Court has previously indicated instead of having a no man's land when the Board declines jurisdiction but at least not having a multiplicity of applications in 48 different states, you will have the exact result which occurred in the Garmon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.038" offset="923564">In the Garmon case, as I stressed in the statement of facts, there was no time when the Board had presented to it, the alleged conduct going to the question of secondary boycott, but at that very same time, that conduct was presented to a trial court in San Diego.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.867" offset="1010813">Now, it's our contention that if that information had been submitted to the Board initially rather than through the Superior Court and only a representation petition having been filed with the National Board, that on the record in this case when the Board had investigated that case, they would have found that there was jurisdiction under their yardsticks based upon the secondary boycott aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.370" offset="1124812">And we submit they would have found that the picketing which was peaceful in all respects was for organizational purposes and occurred only after the union representatives while at the invitation of the employer spoke to the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.201" offset="1192208">The man said we want to join the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.503" offset="1201403">The union representative then went into the employer's place of business and asked him to sign a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.879" offset="1222928">There was no question of representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.360" offset="1232854">The question according to the union's contention on the record was his ability to pay the wage demanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.202" offset="1256155">And yet, in spite of the fact that the employer will not follow up on that procedure and the union then strikes, we submit that we have the intervention at the state level of injunctive relief which is aimed at conduct which is guaranteed to the union under Section 7 of the Act, namely, a pure organizational picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.248" offset="1340374">But on the contrary, you have a determination by an initial trial court followed by an appellate court which specifically finds the item that there is an unfair labor practice under 8 (b) (2) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.759" offset="1406412">The very thing that Congress thought at the national level was so complex and -- and complicated that you needed an expert Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.267" offset="1440475">And it's our argument accordingly that on the point which you have posed the question, that instead of the contention that there is a no man's land, that there is an area where the Board's can come in but the area has to -- the state boards can come in but they have to come in so that it will be operated in a mannequin system with the National Board.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="355.123" offset="1523858">As I understand your argument that you within the state courts and courts enforced (Inaudible) system or authority that they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.632" offset="1605883">Would that petition in other words to say the board -- the state board governed by state law and they -- or they do apply it, they can only apply it, is consistent with the federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="393.641" offset="1677981">No, that's why I think the Garmon case is an excellent example because to -- to create, it must be consistent with the National Act whereby just (Inaudible) pleading as they did in our case, they alleged their -- the industry affecting interstate commerce, they alleged an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.900" offset="1751019">The Board never had that information to determine it with respect to the unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.157" offset="1772022">You can allege facts sufficient in the State such as ours so that you can remove yourself from the application of the local law which renders the conduct legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.323" offset="1808697">You can fail to apply to the Board which you've been exercising.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.928" offset="1823117">The administrative remedies would have protected the conduct and by going down the middle with respect to the area where the Board declines and where the State does not have and under its basic local jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.555" offset="1869615">You will have the third remedy device whereby you can obtain private injunctive relief in direct violation of the underlying theory of the Labor Management Relations Act solely by failing to disclose fully to the Board, the information that it can review.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.086" offset="1935757">And so, the Board will never be in a position and contrary to the statement by this Court in the Garner case.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.720" offset="1958222">This Court in the first instance will have the primary power and duty to review and decide that determination rather than the Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="502.107" offset="2111822">With respect to the second portion of your question if I understood it correctly, Mr. Justice, it appears to go to the question that the Board argues that by the mere declination of power, there is a revitalization of a reserve power in the State to take jurisdiction over the area that Congress has originally vested in the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.382" offset="2212864">Our position on that contention is that when Congress exercised its legislative authority, it went to the full scope of its authority as indicated in the (Inaudible) decision that discretion with respect to permitting the occupancy by the States of the area which Congress gave to the Board, the discretion that was to be exercised was the discretion of the Board, but that it was hand hemmed in with the conditional requirements set forth in Section 10 (a) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.255" offset="2352358">And that accordingly, the mere declination would not be sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="576.068" offset="2407633">The outset I'd like to state briefly, the issue as I view it in our case and that is simply this that may a state court enjoin concerted union activity tortious under our state law and likewise, violative of the federal laws where the Regional Director of the NLRB has conducted an investigation and declined to take jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.251" offset="2548381">I want to emphasize that I said that the active days of the union here were tortious under our California state law contrary to Mr. Scully's contention that they were lawful activities and I will come to that in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.700" offset="2622151">I also want to emphasize the fact that I indicated that the matter was investigated by the National Labor Relations Board by a field examiner and it is so recorded in the records in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.436" offset="2689128">Perhaps, the inadvertent misstatements of Mr. Scully in respect to the activities of the unions rises out of the fact that neither he nor any person appearing on the union's brief in this Court participated in the trial of this case in the lower court or appeared in the appellate courts of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.492" offset="2785364">A study of the record however will indicate conclusively that the nature of the activities were unlawful under California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.164" offset="2840012">The plaintiff employers here are engaged in the retail lumber business at the little town of Escondido.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.073" offset="2871672">They employed eight men.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.064" offset="2883584">The representatives of the two unions and this Building Trades Council called upon them and asked them to sign a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.574" offset="2929664">They were afforded an opportunity to discuss their proposals with the eight employees on two separate occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.230" offset="2968325">The men did not indicate at any time a desire to join the union or any interest in it contrary to what Mr. Scully stated here a few moments ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.289" offset="3016495">The examination of the findings and of the opinion of the Court, the majority opinion indicate that without any uncertainty that --</text>

            <text syncTime="770.098" offset="3183783">The reason I asked that is because the dissenting opinion on page 54 says, "Before discussing those points, it should be observed that under our law, defendant's activity is lawful and hence neither damages nor injunctive relief is proper.</text>

            <text syncTime="883.643" offset="3637896">Now, what I have come to, sir, is this that in those two cases, Park-Tilford and that Lillefloren case, California recognized for the first time, although I must confess it was not too great clarity, the difference between recognition or picketing and organizational picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.680" offset="3718144">In the Park-Tilford case, they dissolved a portion of an existing injunction on the ground that -- that portion of it would prohibit organizational picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.715" offset="3766209">They upheld that portion of the injunction, excuse me, that supported a demand for the immediate signature of a contract holding that that was unlawful under California law long prior to it being unlawful under the Taft-Hartley amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.276" offset="3852518">So California as of Park-Tilford case recognized that recognitional picketing, a demand that an employer places men in the union prior to there being any indication that the employees as such have designated the union to be their bargaining agent or a majority was unlawful and contrary to the policy of the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.165" offset="3960038">Now by strange coincidence, the Lillefloren case cited there, subsequently, the 31 California case was an opinion written by Mr. Justice Carter who wrote the dissent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.933" offset="4023150">And in that case, he dissolved then in or that he on behalf of the five other justices of our Supreme Court comprised of seven, pointed out that a demand for a closed shop would be unlawful citing at Park &amp; Tilford case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.517" offset="4121475">And he restates that the order should have restrained only the unlawful demand for the close shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.588" offset="4153762">On this question of the California law on recognitional picketing as distinguished from organizational picketing, I would like to direct Your Honor's attention to a very authoritative article that has appeared in the December issue of the Stanford University Laws Journal, law review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.002" offset="4251355">Stanford Law Review, December 1956, it was published subsequently to the printing of these briefs with its very authoritative and it draws this distinction which I am endearing to draw for you that California now recognizes a difference at least at times it recognizes a difference between recognitional picketing and organizational picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.910" offset="4358980">And the Court here found that it's -- this fell in the former category as being an unlawful demand for a closed shop violative of both the federal and the state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1104.862" offset="4522820">The findings in this case that I started to mention when Judge Warren asked me a question to indicate contrary to Mr. Scully that the -- the fourth finding found on page 14 that said employees have indicated they do not desire to join or be represented by any of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.644" offset="4645909">And then at the top of page 15, the Court found that the unions did not intend to induce the employees or plaintiff to join the said union or to educate them as to the advantages of benefits of unionization, so that it was strictly a recognitional picket line that confronted us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.717" offset="4742248">Now, we sought aid of NLRB on May 7th as Mr. Scully indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.906" offset="4786970">And on May 21, the field examiner advised us in writing, "On the basis of the information submitted in your letter of May 20th, it is impossible for this office to process further your petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.859" offset="4854784">The amount of business done by Valley Lumber Company, the name of the co-partnership of the Garmon, is insufficient for the Board to assert jurisdiction on the basis of previous Board decisions."</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.050" offset="4907551">Then on May 29, after the field examiner had made his report to the Regional Director, the Regional Director, Mr. Howard F. Laverne wrote to the Valley Lumber Company at Escondido and the -- and the second paragraph of his letter reads as follow, "As a result of the investigation, it appears that in the view of the scope of the business operation involved, it would not effectuate the purposes of the National Labor Relations Act to institute further proceedings at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.422" offset="5057076">And I am therefore dismissing the petition in this matter."</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.480" offset="5081318">Now, I have read that to Your Honor because in the opinion of the majority at page 49, excerpts from those two letters are quoted in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.996" offset="5163342">Unfortunately in the second quote, they omitted the language where there are some asterisks there before the close of the quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.648" offset="5217991">They left this language out, "And I am therefore dismissing the petition in this matter."</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.768" offset="5258428">I think it is of importance in view of some of the questions that have been asked to counsel today regarding these budgetary and other considerations, administrative considerations that in our declination here, they used the language, it would not effectuate the purposes of the National Labor Relations Act to institute further proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.066" offset="5363649">So at that point, we appeal to the Court and obtain our -- our injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.930" offset="5403042">Now, the -- some question was raised in the briefs as to the fact that we had -- did not ask for an unfair labor practice charge or sought that relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.400" offset="5456959">There is a discussion of that in the record in this case and the testimony of Mr. Waddell that he discussed that with Mr. Laverne's office on the telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.995" offset="5503352">And as a result of that, he concluded not to endeavor to file one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.643" offset="5525922">We did not take the position that the union's activities constituted an unfair labor practice.</text>
