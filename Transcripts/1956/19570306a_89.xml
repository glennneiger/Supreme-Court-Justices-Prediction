            <label>Mr. Ellsworth C. Alvord</label>
            <text syncTime="20.796" offset="186598">We are here on certiorari to the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.525" offset="209481">The facts are stipulated and there are three issues in the case, almost three different cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.005" offset="247411">I will attempt to cover the first two issues in the order in which they appear in the Government brief and Mr. Berry will cover the third issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.092" offset="287744">The first issue does the Commissioner have power to revoke retroactively a ruling of some nine-year standing, eleven-year standing, granting tax exemption to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.334" offset="360678">The second issue is, did he act within the applicable statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.098" offset="391816">The third issue which Mr. Berry will cover is, did the Commissioner have power to compel the petitioner to change his long standing, consistent methods of accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.238" offset="448345">These are the facts that were stipulated and relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.742" offset="466317">The petitioner is an automobile service organization, organized under the nonprofit laws of Michigan having no stockholders, only members governed by the Board of Directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.146" offset="519920">Like in other, certificate of incorporations and by-laws, all of which are in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.030" offset="543535">Its principal purpose is exactly what we all know an Automobile Association is to give its members emergency service.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.608" offset="581778">If your car doesn't start in the morning, you get stuck on the road, you may call and service is sent.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.899" offset="615006">The Club pays the cost of the service under contracts of various service garages.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.073" offset="643636">That is its principal function.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.095" offset="655757">It also supplies road service to its members, and less, rising where the roads are good and where they're bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.416" offset="693060">It also gives a magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.879" offset="706853">Its membership is on annual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.752" offset="726392">It has never paid a dividend and could not pay a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.017" offset="759411">Early in 1934, it was concerned about the application of Section 215 of the National Recovery Act which imposed a capital stock tax upon corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.168" offset="812074">And as a result of its inquiry the Commissioner wrote a letter and said, "Please send me the facts" and imposed the question there which call for a very detailed facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.415" offset="857004">In June of 1934, the Commissioner by letter advised the petitioner, that was exempt from tax under what is now known as Section 101 (9), the same Section under which golf clubs, private golf clubs are exempted, the Metropolitan Club and the Press Club, and all recreations, social subject exempt a value of the petitioner that was exempt under 101(9).</text>
            <text syncTime="217.281" offset="972466">And that it need not file income tax returns, either for the past or for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.579" offset="1025651">Somewhat later in 1937 the Commissioner in accordance with his practice have attempted to check on tax exempt organizations or organizations which have been ruled tax exempt as for another questionnaire with a copy filled in and returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.491" offset="1101302">A second letter came out a few months later saying, "We affirm our prior ruling that you are not -- that you're exempt and you were not called upon to prior corporate income tax returns".</text>
            <text syncTime="265.545" offset="1165563">And there the matter stood.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.818" offset="1178624">Until my point of view, 1945 but there's an intervening factor of no consequence although the Government pays a great deal of weight to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.223" offset="1244244">A General Counsel Memorandum which has nothing but the opinion of the General Counsel of the Bureau of Internal Revenue given to the Commission of Internal Revenue for his guidance which he may follow or my not.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.706" offset="1302235">He often does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.229" offset="1312266">It was published in the internal revenue bulletin.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.086" offset="1331702">That memorandum was addressed to the 3 A's, which is the Washington organization which is a federation of all the various local clubs such as the Michigan Club.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.795" offset="1378513">Now so you won't be confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.084" offset="1387708">In the district, the 3 A's also has a separate division which operates like the Michigan Club did, but that's not the principal function of the 3 A's.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.591" offset="1425742">In fact GCM said, "You 3 A's are not exempt despite our prior ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.349" offset="1460746">And in my point of view, that's all that happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.760" offset="1482376">In 1945, the Commissioner writes the petitioner a letter saying that in the light of this GCM, we are reconsidering whether automobile clubs and you specifically are to be exempt under 101 (9).</text>
            <text syncTime="365.115" offset="1563878">Please send this information and the information was presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.549" offset="1585612">It was considered by the Commissioner and on July 11th, 1945 I think it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.902" offset="1630960">He wrote to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.724" offset="1646320">Wrote a long letter, it's in the record saying "We have given thorough consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.096" offset="1675786">We have now changed our views about clubs under Section 101 (9).</text>
            <text syncTime="399.255" offset="1700342">We think that there must be some friendship, some social -- social purposes involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.452" offset="1729181">And we rule that you have no social friendship purposes, no association together,” and he was right in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.704" offset="1766170">“And therefore we rule that you were not exempt from taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.094" offset="1791770">From that moment on, we do not dispute, Mr. (Inaudible) that anytime he could say "Gentlemen as to the future, I've changed my mind.”</text>
            <text syncTime="433.128" offset="1835865">But the letter goes on to say, his letter is in 1945, says that you must now file returns for 1943 and 1944 for the two years preceding, two years and six in one case plus six months preceding with the specific revocation ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.073" offset="1939623">Returns were filed under protest and statements on the returns were made, prior returns of income and excess, profits, taxes had not been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.207" offset="1984240">Because of reliance upon the tax exempt rulings which have been enforced to some 10 to 11 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="483.118" offset="2035858">There is nothing in the statute anywhere which gives the Commissioner that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.683" offset="2058115">The regulations under which he was acted, Regulation 111 which we cite to you, in my opinion denied them both.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.838" offset="2106702">The regulation says that when the Commissioner determines that an organization is exempt, not quite in those words it says when an organization establishes its right to exemption, which means when the Commissioner agrees with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.039" offset="2167515">From that time on, no returns are required for income tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.147" offset="2191966">And there is nothing in the regulation which gives the Commissioner the power to change his mind retroactively.</text>

            <text syncTime="2251.334" offset="9108668">Of the two questions before the Court here, I'd like to start off with the ruling question and then later come back to the accounting question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.916" offset="9150986">As regard to this ruling, there seems to be some intimation here, the certain lack of integrity on the part of the tax collectors in a so-called retroactive revocation of a ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.851" offset="9202813">And taxpayers are asking this Court to come to their rescue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.973" offset="9219218">I think it is pertinent in this case to remember, as Mr. Alvord pointed out, that they have conceded on this oral argument before the tax court that this outset is not exempt after 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.545" offset="9289540">This to us means that it never was exempt under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.605" offset="9305840">Therefore, we have an organization which since 1916 until 1943 did not bear its fair share of the tax burden which Congress meant to place upon organizations of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.190" offset="9364146">And now, this Court is being asked to help it to escape its fair share taxes for two additional years, 1916 to 1943 apparently wasn't enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.627" offset="9417853">Now in pointing up our approach to this case, I would like to briefly summarize the facts of this case, discuss the statute under which the Commissioner is operating and finally try to analyze just what it is that the taxpayer is complaining about in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.715" offset="9498206">Taxpayer was organized in 1916.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.696" offset="9510118">No ruling was requested as far as we know no tax returns were ever filed until 1945, and no tax was ever paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.600" offset="9549824">It is possible that it thought it was exempt on the basis of an office decision of the Internal Revenue Service issued in 1920 with regard to an automobile club.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.277" offset="9600502">As Mr. Alvord has pointed out in 1934, the Commissioner or Internal Revenue issued a ruling which we say is erroneous and has been shown by the courts to be erroneous to this club stating that it was exempt from income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.342" offset="9664763">And said you don't have to file returns all the way back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.948" offset="9679182">You won't have to file any returns in the future unless you change your method of operation, organization, or purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.213" offset="9708231">In 1938, a letter of erroneous ruling was issued to the same taxpayer reaffirming the 1934 ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.961" offset="9755251">Now, during all this time, the Commissioner was far from title in this field.</text>

            <text syncTime="2533.168" offset="10236008">Now, Mr. Alvord has been somewhat disparaging of a General Counsel's Memorandum and although it doesn't appear on the record, I can tell the Court that a General Counsel's Memorandum being an opinion of the General Counsel, when it is published in the Internal Revenue Board the way this way for general circulation to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.951" offset="10319182">It is approved by the Commissioner's office, therefore, it is a ruling of the revenue service and not merely just an opinion of the General Counsel of the Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.197" offset="10368188">This ruling was published in the Internal Revenue Board in 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.966" offset="10391280">It stated that it was reconsidering the status and all these automobile clubs or rather the status of an association of automobile clubs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.721" offset="10426284">And it was obviously directed and it's been admitted that it was directed at the American Automobile Association not at a local club.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.075" offset="10463692">This ruling also revoked both of those two 1928 published GCMs, one of which had to do with an Association of Automobile Club, the other of which had to do with a local automobile club.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.054" offset="10523564">As a result of the publication of this General Counsel's Memorandum in 1943, the Commissioner started looking into all the status of all of these clubs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.103" offset="10571734">He did not want to revoke without giving anybody a chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.569" offset="10589602">So he started going through his records and looking for those who had never filed for an exemption anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.119" offset="10611858">He got around to a great many of them in 1943, but Government being what it is, he didn't get around to this particular club until 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.284" offset="10652505">And at that time, he wrote a letter and said in the light of the 1943 published GCM were reconsidering the problem of your exemption, will you please submit information so that we can find out whether you are distinguishable from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.377" offset="10720841">As a result of the information that was submitted, a ruling was issued to the taxpayer, which stated that it was no longer exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.858" offset="10758771">It said, "You are not required to file income tax returns for periods commencing before January 1, 1943."</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.532" offset="10809448">That was because the GCM was published for everybody to see in 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.153" offset="10835989">But you will be required and are required to file income and excess products tax returns for years beginning after, I think it was December 31, 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.520" offset="10885413">At any rate, these taxpayers are on a calendar year basis and he was required to file and did file in 1945 income and excess profit tax returns covering the years 1943 and 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.047" offset="10951555">The assessment or rather the notice of deficiency finally after a great many negotiations between revenue and the taxpayer was issued in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.166" offset="11000038">Now, if the statute of limitations and that is a question on this case began to run as we think it did when those returns were filed in 1945 at the request of the Commissioner and not at some time back in 1943 or 1944, then there's no question in this case that the notice of deficiency was timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.359" offset="11096795">Now the taxpayer here seems to be saying, first, that this revocation of its ruling in 1945, and direction to file in 1943 was a retroactive revocation and furthermore, it was unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.257" offset="11176417">Now I think that if it is analyzed that this 1943 ruling was issued to the American Automobile Club, it was published in the Internal Revenue Board for everyone to see.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.715" offset="11270248">The taxpayer here is associated with the American Automobile Club.</text>

            <text syncTime="2910.611" offset="11745782">Now, the complaint seems to be that we did not get around to this ruling and revoke it or revenue didn't when it should.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.505" offset="11789354">Therefore they say that until our individual ruling is revoked, we are still -- we still continue to be exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.895" offset="11826970">And the revenue service in the course of the year issues hundreds of rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.788" offset="11842539">Over the course of the years, they've issued thousands of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.660" offset="11858004">And we think that it would be a very serious detriment to the orderly and collection and administration of the revenue if every individual ruling had to be reconsidered everytime there's a reconsideration of policy in the light of a change of policy or a court decision or something by the revenue service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.494" offset="11941386">And we think that a publication in the Internal Revenue Board which is just for this purpose is sufficient notice to taxpayers to come in and ask to have their or at least know that their individual ruling may no longer be considered finding by the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.767" offset="12030412">Now this taxpayer apparently gets that fact and said, “Well I'll sit around and wait until they come and get me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.417" offset="12069073">They're trying to enjoy this way a position which was not enjoyed by mostly other taxpayers because as Mr. Alvord pointed out in all the cases which were litigated, revenue did get around to it in 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.611" offset="12129782">Now they also say that there is an unfairness here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.581" offset="12145664">The unfairness is a little hard for me to see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.548" offset="12157576">In the first place, this organization can't show any hardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.328" offset="12172727">Perhaps if we had revoked back in 1916 or 1938 and take away all their assets or something like that, put them out of business, it certainly would have been hardship.</text>

            <text syncTime="3056.504" offset="12329357">In fact, the only detriment that they've been able to show on the brief is that had they known that there they were not exempt, they would have setup a reserve to pay the income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.933" offset="12375124">Well it seems to us that any prudent accounting knowing that the General Counsel of the Treasury had just published a memorandum that these clubs are not exempt, would have setup a reserve in case they were finally determined that they weren't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.288" offset="12444505">We also think that the Commissioner was not only being fair in applying this ruling to all taxpayers similarly situated as of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.385" offset="12488913">And there's one point here, and of course we can't break-up taxable years, so there's one taxpayer here who got away with an extra six months because he was on a fiscal year and the ruling was made retroactive only to fiscal years beginning on and after January 31, 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.400" offset="12556936">So beyond on August to June 30 of fiscal year, you get away with a little bit there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.282" offset="12576475">But that was something that we couldn't help.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.656" offset="12589955">It seems to us that this 1943 ruling applied to the taxpayer and that he knew it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.478" offset="12617331">And furthermore, that there was nothing unfair or indiscrete or on the action of the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.133" offset="12651917">Now if we assume that this was a retroactive revocation of a ruling and we certainly don't admit it, then we have to look at the statute to see just what the Commissioner's power to revoke rulings retroactively is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.128" offset="12727881">Under Section 3791 (b) of the 1939 Code, it is stated in effect and that's quoted on page 30 of our brief, "That the Commissioner may prescribe the extent, if any, to which any ruling, regulation, or Treasury decision, relating to the internal revenue laws, shall be applied without retroactive effect."</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.968" offset="12827251">In other words the discretion of the Commissioner is to issue in certain cases, rulings prospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.226" offset="12856299">And it is certainly recognized in there and clear on its face that the Commissioner has the power to revoke rulings, regulations, Treasury decisions retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.983" offset="12907290">If there's any question about that, going back to the 1921 Act when this -- the predecessor of this section first came in, it was put in the law by the Committee to take care of the situation where the Attorney General, in 1919 had revoked an excised tax ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.030" offset="12999450">And it was recognized and stated in the committee report that it was understood that no administrative officer had the power to forgive or to weigh collection of a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.743" offset="13054307">Therefore, the Commissioner was under a duty to apply this ruling of the Attorney General revoking another ruling retroactively to the years 1917 and 1918.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.731" offset="13106343">And it was stated that this would help the administration of the revenue to -- and prevent the opening of literally thousands of cases everytime there was a change in the views of the -- those administering the revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.266" offset="13192443">Far from restricting this power, it has been extended from year to year since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.199" offset="13212191">There have been a couple of extensions that first started of by saying that it could be this, the discretion in the Commissioner could be applied only where a court decision did not require that the ruling be revoked retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.118" offset="13279796">Later on, that was taken out of the law and although the first one just said, "A Treasury decision or a regulation".</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.513" offset="13313442">It was finally extended to the retroactive revocation of a ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.646" offset="13349909">Now in this particular section of the law has been under consideration once before by this Court in the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.616" offset="13397870">In that case, under the broad provision of 22 (a) which it used to define income in the vague words of gains, profits, and income, the Commissioner had come out with a regulation and had -- which had stated that the purchase and sale of stock by a corporation is a capital transaction that doesn't give rise to gain or loss.</text>
