            <text syncTime="14.048" offset="159535">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.869" offset="170820">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, Mr. Belcher.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.816" offset="194644">This case arise before this Court by reason of the action of the Committee of Bar Examiners in the State of California in denying the petitioner admission to the Bar of California by reason of his alleged views, opinions and associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.838" offset="286699">Under the State Bar Act of California, the Committee of Bar Examiners is empowered to certify to the Supreme Court applicants who fulfill certain requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.124" offset="343855">There is no dispute that the petitioner here fulfilled all of the educational, age, residence and other requirements of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.286" offset="384502">There are in addition, two other requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.494" offset="397354">One is that the applicant be a person of good moral character, and the second is that the legislature in California has said that no person who advocates the overthrow of the Government by force and violence or other unconstitutional means shall be certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.138" offset="467884">Now, shortly before the time that the petitioner here took the bar examination in the State of California, he was called in before the Committee of Bar Examiners and asked certain questions relative to his qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.843" offset="526712">He thereafter, with the consent of the Committee took the bar examination and passed it so that there are no impediments other than the position of the Committee of Bar Examiners that the petitioner here has not sustained his burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.678" offset="590033">That he is a person of good moral character, and they state he has not sustained his burden of proof that he does not believe in the overthrow of the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.474" offset="637262">Now, over a period of time, there were four hearings held before the Committee of Bar Examiners.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.647" offset="661922">Three, before this other in subsection and then a final hearing in effect that de novo hearing before the full committee of these bar examiners for the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.933" offset="707062">In the course of these hearings, the following facts were basically established.First of all, the petitioner himself, the background of the petitioner, a graduate of Ohio State University in 1931, later getting a master's degree in Social Work, taught History and English Literature in the Cleveland High School.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.254" offset="788355">He was a supervisor in the Department of Health here in Washington, D.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.317" offset="804655">He was a Research Director of the Council of Social Agencies in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.364" offset="820851">He was a supervisor for the State Relief Administration in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.075" offset="835688">He was a Director of Social Services in the City of Hope Sanitarium in Duarte, California.Subsequently, in the -- during the war, he became a captain and he -- and was in charge of information and education for some 400,000 soldiers in Germany in the Seventh Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.269" offset="916459">And three times, he was a candidate for public office in Los Angeles, twice for the Board of Education and once for the State Assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.269" offset="948433">The record contains no single fact other than those which I shall refer to in a moment, indicating anything about his work record, his personal record, his life in the community of Los Angeles other than the very highest recommendation as to his character.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.323" offset="1020635">In addition, the petitioner brought before the Committee of Bar Examiners some 40 letters from every single stage of his life as a social worker in the hospitals, in the army, everything, in -- in the university.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.899" offset="1078941">He brought letters from persons like Right Reverend Monsignor Dwyer, from Rabbi Jed Cohen, community leaders all indicating that he had an impeccable personal record in his community.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.482" offset="1137351">Now, at the hearings, the Committee commenced by introducing and showing to the petitioner a series of articles which he had written during a brief period of employment with a Los Angeles newspaper known as the California Eagle.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.994" offset="1211329">This is a newspaper of weekly circulation and primarily -- primary circulation is in the Negro community of Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.733" offset="1250304">These articles were vigorous, pungent, strong, challenging political articles but all dealing with the political -- were all commentaries on the political affairs of the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.631" offset="1317909">These articles were introduced and shown to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.232" offset="1328253">He acknowledged that he had written them over a period of about a year and he was asked at various times.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.064" offset="1363675">“Do you still believe the things that are in these articles?</text>
            <text syncTime="318.623" offset="1377886">Would you write the same articles today?”</text>
            <text syncTime="321.229" offset="1388335">And a number of questions of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.149" offset="1399933">Now, he further introduced testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.273" offset="1412472">There was further introduced certain testimony that in one point he had appeared before a -- the California Senate Investigating Committee, commonly known as the Tenney Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.896" offset="1455000">And he was asked whether the testimony that he had given at that time before that Committee would be his opinion at this time, and he was shown a written statement that he had introduced at that time and asked whether he still believe these things to be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.187" offset="1512155">Now, he was also asked whether or not he was a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.345" offset="1536711">There was introduced a witness who came before the Committee who testified that sometime in 1941 or 1942, the petitioner had been a member of a small group in the Communist Party with this -- with this witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.197" offset="1600136">She was asked on cross-examination whether or not what was said at the meetings, she recalled nothing that was said in any of the meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.314" offset="1628662">She was asked whether there was any discussion of advocacy of force and violence, she said, she didn't remember anything that anybody said including this petitioner at any of those meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.373" offset="1668890">So that there was no evidence presented at the hearings other than the -- their testimony that he -- that this witness who incidentally went under cross-examination, when asked how she knew this petitioner she said, “Well, he's the only face in the room that's familiar to me, so he must be Konigsberg.”</text>
            <text syncTime="409.867" offset="1742869">But assuming that the -- that there was some element of identification, the only testimony that there was, was the bare testimony that he may have been a member of the Communist Party in 1940 or 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.938" offset="1799084">Now, he was asked questions regarding an advocacy of force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.997" offset="1815385">He answered, responded to every such question and not once but about six times during the course of the hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.017" offset="1847463">He said specifically, “I do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.057" offset="1855613">I never have.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.130" offset="1859897">I never will.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.533" offset="1865540">My entire record, my entire background is contrary to any belief in doctrines of force and violence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="448.365" offset="1896782">He did on one occasion respond to a question, “Are you a Communist?”</text>
            <text syncTime="454.546" offset="1921546">And he answered to this question, “no,” if you mean by that, a philosophical Communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.800" offset="1946624">There was some colloquy between the Committee and the petitioner at this point in which he indicated that what he was trying to distinguish was between his belief in Jeffersonian Democracy which did not mean advocacy of force and violence and their interpretation apparently of Communist Party membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.831" offset="2026663">So that he specifically denied that he was a Communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.887" offset="2038888">He declined to answer repeatedly saying that this is solely on the basis of high moral principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.815" offset="2066683">He said that this is not self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.625" offset="2077863">I am not relying on the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.606" offset="2085804">I'm relying solely on the First Amendment and my -- my deep abiding feeling that you have no right to inquire into this area.</text>

            <text syncTime="516.231" offset="2168247">But I think a -- a careful examination of each of the references that he made would indicate that the basic reference was that on the basis of the First Amendment they had no right to inquire.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.692" offset="2218088">He did make such comments.</text>

            <text syncTime="2850.371" offset="11504828">Let me give an example and by a specific thing that we have in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.723" offset="11522278">A respondent in this record apparently recognizing that simple membership alone would not have been sufficient and they -- they go back and forth on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.578" offset="11561671">On one place, they say yes, another place they say no, have decided that they must in some way and this record show that he really does believe in force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.005" offset="11599391">So, in order to establish this, they seek through these articles that they've introduced and they've read them through and called them through.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.352" offset="11636799">And what did they come up with in order to prove that this petitioner believes in force and violence, they come up with a statement that reads substantially like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.099" offset="11671803">They say petitioner wrote in this article that everyone should militantly defend the principles of the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.891" offset="11710986">And then they put in quite parenthetically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.640" offset="11717883">They say, “Militant means forceful, warlike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.411" offset="11733034">Therefore, he believes in force and violence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.978" offset="11747244">Now, this is what happens as soon -- and by ways of specific examples -- this is exactly what is going to happen as soon as we penetrate into this area of “what do you think” and “what does this article mean” and “who were your associations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.663" offset="11810043">We'll come up with this kind of -- of article which they have said now in this record before this Court this proves that this man or it -- they don't say proofs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.970" offset="11855287">I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.314" offset="11856645">They say this indicates that perhaps he really does believe in force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.774" offset="11874513">And this is exactly what happens not only in the articles, but it's also going to happen as soon as we start intruding into and I -- I hope I'm not being too general, but into the area of what a person thinks in the political area, in the realm of -- of political ideas where what this generation says is correct and true and -- and right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.466" offset="11973256">Perhaps, 10 years from now, someone else will say no and this petitioner can't wait 10 years to be admitted to the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.522" offset="11997497">It seems to me that in the case of the -- of the applicant for admission to the Bar, he has established on this record his good moral character by every standard which we have known in the past, save the one that they -- that the respondent here is endeavoring to bring in and that is he has refused to answer these couple of questions, these few questions and sometime in the past without more, he was, they alleged a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.041" offset="12111496">So that -- it seems to me that what we are dealing with this is -- is an entire record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.985" offset="12135320">Maybe this case would be different if we had a 23-year old boy asked some of these questions, I think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.296" offset="12160606">But we have a record here which is overwhelming in its proof of this man's good moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.847" offset="12190804">Every sign in this record points to his good moral character, except these intrusions into this -- this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.703" offset="12226226">And it submit -- it seems to me that given this record to hold that this man on the basis of this -- his failure to answer these few questions and this -- the other points that they have raised, it becomes an arbitrary determination and contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.214" offset="12300204">Now, I had hoped to hold a few minutes, I think I have about five and I would like at this time to -- to reserve that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3086.966" offset="12451192">Paraphrasing these questions, the first were, were petitioners constitutional claims raised before the Supreme Court of California?</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.740" offset="12490376">The second question was, was the Supreme Court of California's denial of the petition for a writ of review, a final judgment within the meaning of 28 U.S. Code 1257?</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.131" offset="12543875">And the third question was, if a final question, was it a rejection of petitioner's claims under the Fourteenth Amendment?</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.627" offset="12577834">Answering those questions, I would say that in my judgment, the answer to the second question is yes, that the rejection by the Supreme Court of California of this petition for a writ of review was a final judgment sufficient for the purpose of giving this Court jurisdiction in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.133" offset="12659858">Answering however the first and the third questions, my answer to this Court is no to each of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3847.866" offset="15494875">Now, it is true that for many years, the Court out there entertained very informal petitions that did not have to be much more than a letter simply stating if we want the Court to review this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3860.386" offset="15544926">But I have known of no relaxation in the requirements of that Court so far as the briefing is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.426" offset="15581080">I place that Court -- that points simply before the Court because we were directed to argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.743" offset="15606366">Now, the petitioner in his briefs and in his arguments before this Court here has sought to show that this petitioner was denied admission or certification for admission in California because of his political, economic and social beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.910" offset="15663000">I say to this Court with all the conviction that I can muster that I think there is no foundation for that statement at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3898.076" offset="15695705">That the petitioner in this case was denied certification to the Supreme Court because he failed to establish his good moral character and because he left some considerable doubt as to how he stood on the matter of the use of force and violence in the overthrow of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3916.727" offset="15770311">Now, we have a specific statute on that score that no one maybe certified for evasion to practice law who advocates the overthrow of either the Federal or the State Government by force and violence or other constitutional means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.337" offset="15828720">That is the way the matter became a subject of inquiry before our Board of Bar Examiners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.546" offset="15857560">Now, the Board of Bar Examiners made two findings and one of them was that this petitioner had not sustained the burden of proof as to his good moral character and that he had not let the statutory test -- test of being one who could not advocate the overthrow of -- the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3958.334" offset="15936658">And there was no finding that he was denied admission because of any of his social, economic or political beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.516" offset="15965393">Now, by statute, it became the duty of the Board of Bar Governors to make inquiry into these things, and that is exactly what they did in discharge of their duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.233" offset="16008338">Now, the report passes of evidence in all which were introduced into that hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3981.664" offset="16030072">The first one had to deal with a transcript of a hearing in which this petitioner appeared before the so-called Tenney Committee which was a legislative Un-American Activities Committee in the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.554" offset="16085556">Now, at the time he appeared before that Committee as shown by transcript of the proceedings, he was asked and I quote.</text>

            <text syncTime="4096.448" offset="16489200">But in the course of her testimony, she testified that it is implicit in the fact that one who is a Communist that one expected a forceful overthrow of the Government at some time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.118" offset="16531832">Now, this respondent was present when Mrs. Bennett testified, and later on, when he was on the stand he was asked by a member of the Committee as follows and I'm now referring to page 117 of the brief of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4120.455" offset="16585226">“Who?</text>

            <text syncTime="4138.774" offset="16658474">And again, he said, “The Committee is not empowered to ask with regard to political affiliations of that type.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4145.973" offset="16687313">And in short, he may -- he declined to make any more specific answer but no place, even no given repeated opportunities so to do that he ever denied one word of what Mrs. Bennett had testified to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.477" offset="16745305">Now, in addition to that, they were introduced into the record here as counsel for petitioner has indicated some 27 articles which the petitioner had written for this newspaper called, The Eagle.</text>
            <text syncTime="4172.412" offset="16793057">The petitioner himself later put in some 51 articles which as I recall included the 27, which the Committee had introduced.</text>

            <text syncTime="4261.671" offset="17150098">The second trend in these articles which he wrote shows his extreme sympathy with everyone who has some leaning towards the Communist doctrine and particularly with the Soviet Union and things that they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4276.300" offset="17208613">For instance, he wrote, “On freedom side or such good people as a Hollywood Ten, the (Inaudible), the Members of Progressive Party, the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee, the Paul Robeson's and the Howard Fast's.</text>
            <text syncTime="4289.866" offset="17262843">On the other side are the giant corporations, the Mac Arthur's, the Truman's, the Mason's, the American Legion, the Chamber of Commerce and practically all press, radio and movies.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4300.427" offset="17305057">Again, he says, “A school system that is so deeply committed to the anti -- anti-democratic conspiracies being enjoyed by the economic loyalists to whom they have sold out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.795" offset="17354585">I criticize the Boards of Education, the Board of Supervisors, the Sheriff, the City Council.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4318.718" offset="17378200">He called our defense forces a scoff army and he spoke up and again I quote, “Sons slaughtered on foreign fields to ensure greater profits for the Morgan's and the Mac Arthur's.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4330.839" offset="17426683">He was severely critical of the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, called the President dishonest, spoke of him as Hydrogen Harry and referred to and again I quote, "His program for war and American fascism which Taft and his collaborators are helping Truman and his cronies to fasten on America."</text>
            <text syncTime="4350.519" offset="17505468">He wrote quote -- and quoting again, “The nationalist theory and terror over communism, manufactured by the Taft-Truman axis to divide and deceive the American people.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4361.250" offset="17548413">Again, he also wrote of the intellectual dishonesty of certain Senators and he spoke to the leaders of our land as and again I quote, "Men without principles, without morals and without hopes."</text>
            <text syncTime="4374.202" offset="17600136">He wrote of American imperialism and he also wrote and again I quote, "The obscene cry of fighting communism."</text>
            <text syncTime="4383.181" offset="17636080">He charged the United States of these articles with aggression in Korea.</text>
            <text syncTime="4387.804" offset="17654575">He demanded that we take our troops out of Korea.</text>
            <text syncTime="4390.997" offset="17667323">He advocated joining the Soviet Union in rebuilding a democratic United Nations and world peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="4397.728" offset="17694281">He wrote critically of the building of strings of bases around the Soviet Republic and he charged the United States of provoking China and with aggression in Korea.</text>
            <text syncTime="4408.493" offset="17737331">He charged the United States with war against the people of Korea and spoke of it as being a criminal war.</text>
            <text syncTime="4414.934" offset="17763140">He bemoaned and again I quote, “The jailing of the leaders of the Communist Party.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4419.935" offset="17783097">He charged our Government who are trying the outlaw peace but he praised the Soviets as being the true promoters of peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="4427.592" offset="17813713">He advocated the withdrawal of our forces from Korea, of canceling the martial plan, of withdrawing that from the North Atlantic Pact and he urged recognition and establishment of trade relations with Red China and with their admissions to the -- the United Nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4444.983" offset="17883303">He also charged the leaders of our land with and again I quote, "Treasonous betrayals of our political code."</text>
            <text syncTime="4452.591" offset="17913710">He charged the Supreme Court of the United States that sold out to its enemies and that again I quote, "Judges with impunity violate our constitutional rights."</text>
            <text syncTime="4463.022" offset="17955506">He even charged the Vatican and the Pope with duplicity and conspiring to help Hitler launch World War II and he blasted all persons who criticized Russia.</text>
            <text syncTime="4473.797" offset="17998555">He charged the American people with permitting the Government to make war on the people of Greece, China and Korea and predicted that in time, the Government might make war even upon its own people.</text>

            <text syncTime="4517.084" offset="18171695">Now, I want to again make it clear, exceedingly clear that I recognize the man's right to write and speak as he has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.396" offset="18212968">But I want to make it equally clear that I think that the Committee of Bar Examiners of California not only had the right but that they had the duty with those utterances coming from him to ask concerning some of his beliefs with reference to the forceful overthrow of the Government or the use of other unconstitutional means.</text>
            <text syncTime="4548.114" offset="18295829">Now, the Committee did attempt to question Mr. Konigsberg with respect to these articles but without much success.</text>
            <text syncTime="4555.519" offset="18325400">For example, when they asked him if certain statements written by him was a true statement, he replied in substance that when a person writes as a newspaperman, freedom of the press and freedom of the speech are involved, "regardless of truth or falsity.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4574.456" offset="18401155">And argued that by reason of the First Amendment, he was not required to answer as to whether he now took the same position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4581.367" offset="18428844">When asked again further as to some of his present beliefs, he answered and stated and again I quote him, "I believe that what I believe today has no bearing on my moral fitness to practice law."</text>
            <text syncTime="4595.449" offset="18485164">Now, he persisted in that position time and time again even though this Committee advised him that all it was trying to do was to test his veracity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4606.084" offset="18527692">Now, the following transport -- transpired in front of this Committee by Mr. Fuller, a member of the Committee, quote, "To return to the editorial entitled, Court of Last Resort, dated May the 11th of 1950, there is this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="4621.802" offset="18590595">When the Supreme Court of these benighted States can refuse to review the case of the Hollywood Ten, thus making that high tribunal an integral part of the Cold War machine directed against the American people, then the enemies of democracy have indeed won a major victory.</text>

            <text syncTime="4655.395" offset="18724968">He questioned, “You made that statement?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4657.610" offset="18733850">Mr. Konigsberg - “If that is a correct copy of what I wrote, I made the statement at that time, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4663.464" offset="18757256">Mr. Fuller - “And would you make that Statement today?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4667.040" offset="18771571">Mr. Konigsberg - “Again, I give you the answer that because of the guarantees of the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press under the First Amendment, the Committee has not empowered into -- to inquire into what I think or say today.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4682.540" offset="18833533">Mr. Fuller - “Have you any evidence to support your statement at the Supreme Court sold out to the enemy?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4688.445" offset="18857148">Mr. Konigsberg - “I think I covered that in what I said in answer to your previous question.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4694.107" offset="18879822">Mr. Fuller - “I don't believe it is in the evidence to support that statement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4698.120" offset="18895809">Mr. Konigsberg - “Are you asking me if I have any evidence now?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4701.947" offset="18911169">Mr. Fuller - “Did you have any evidence then?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4704.901" offset="18922977">Mr. Konigsberg - “I think the same answer applies.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4708.296" offset="18936560">Mr. Fuller - “What is the answer?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4710.071" offset="18943666">Mr. Konigsberg - “The Committee is not empowered to ask me questions relating to what I thought or opinions which I express.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4720.581" offset="18985671">Now, the Committee also asked this petitioner, quote, "Mr. Konigsberg, are you a Communist?"</text>
            <text syncTime="4727.689" offset="19014092">Now, his answer to that was long and in bulk but in substance it was that he did not advocate the overthrow of the Government by force or violence that whether he was or wasn't a Communist, the Committee would get a dozen informers who would say the opposite and that his right of political opinion is protected under the First Amendment, but he didn't answer the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.170" offset="19104057">Pages 37, 38 and 39 of the record, the same question was put to him and he took the same attitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.524" offset="19133419">When he was asked if he had knowingly participated in any organization which he believe was sympathetic to the Communist cause, his answer in substance was that it wouldn't have made any difference to him one way or the other, so long as the organization had other proper objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="4775.917" offset="19207084">And he declined again on page 40 of the record to say whether he was or was not a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.867" offset="19238849">On page 118 of the record, he was asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="4786.230" offset="19248253">“Are you a member of the Communist Party now?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.377" offset="19260897">To which he made this reply “The answer is the same I would give.</text>
            <text syncTime="4794.034" offset="19279496">The Committee is not empowered any more than they may inquire whether I'm an Elk, a Freemason, a Democrat or a Republican.</text>

            <text syncTime="4808.773" offset="19338428">Now, he was advised by this Committee that the Committee was interested in knowing whether or not he had any past or present affiliations with the Communist Party.</text>

            <text syncTime="5888.459" offset="23657200">"We think that a municipal employer is not disabled because it is an agency of the State from inquiring of its employees as to matters that may prove relevant to their fitness and suitability to public service.</text>

            <text syncTime="6441.017" offset="25867473">I also call to the Court's attention and this was -- is only a first step before the California court have they granted review, we would then have filed our actual briefs and arguments so that this was a preliminary step before the California court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6457.128" offset="25931839">But let me address myself just to the couple of points that counsel has mentioned here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6462.985" offset="25955349">First of all, he has said that we failed to meet our burden of proof and has placed everything on this burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="6471.097" offset="25987741">He has avoided saying that it was this -- it was the failure to answer questions or it was the Communist Party membership or it was the articles of the Tenney Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="6481.906" offset="26031000">He has simply lump them all together and said, “We haven't met our burden of proof.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6486.106" offset="26047822">Now, I want to submit to the Court that this -- on this record, the burden of proof within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, that is we have only -- we have not an unlimited burden of proof to meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="6500.673" offset="26106023">We have a reasonable burden of proof to meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="6503.534" offset="26117517">They cannot place upon us an unreasonable burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="6507.157" offset="26132041">Now, I submit that on this record, where we have shown affirmatively our good moral character beyond anything that any normal person could do any 23 or 24-year old could do while we've qualified educationally passed the Bar exam affirmatively in addition to simply in language established non-belief in force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6528.828" offset="26218663">And I call to Your Honors attention the one article that dealt with a relevant question under their theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="6534.686" offset="26242069">Force and violence was a complete declaration of that people should be punished to believe in force and violence.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>

            <text syncTime="6543.949" offset="26279163">That was one that seemed to have been omitted in their original offer which we subsequently in order to make the file clear did offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6553.496" offset="26317406">And we -- we have shown an affirmation of belief in democratic principles and the deviation on this -- this philosophical Communist question only came in the context of saying if you mean by a philosophical Communist, I am a believer in Jeffersonian democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6570.918" offset="26386996">And in that sense, certainly, I am not a philosophical Communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="6574.030" offset="26399535">This was the context in which this question was answered going directly to the force and violence question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6581.486" offset="26429315">Introduced letters from all walks of life and -- and just to -- to point out one of them from Professor Niverville of the University of Southern California, one of the people who knew him last and closest points out, “It was my impression that Mr. Konigsberg is a man with the courage of his convictions but not one who holds those convictions blindly or with any but the most honest motives.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6603.527" offset="26517504">He seems to hold the Constitution in high esteem and is a vigorous supporter of civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6608.389" offset="26536939">But it is interesting to note that despite his vigorous position, he showed a willingness to recognize the necessity from time to time of balancing the interest of the individual against the interest of society and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="6620.483" offset="26585318">So that when counsel says, “The letters did not go to the heart of the issue,” these letters did go to the heart of the issue and we offered to bring these people before the Committee and let them cross-examine them on the heart, but the Committee never availed itself of that opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="6635.454" offset="26645191">Now, --</text>

            <text syncTime="6659.288" offset="26740485">I would not -- the facts would not be that close, Your Honor that I would want to comment on it from that point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="6666.869" offset="26770892">I -- I would like to refer to the other cases of the counsel cited and the Adler case for instance where counsel used this to say and pointed out that it involved the right to work in a school system and I submit that right there, we've come to the crux of the difference and it is certainly not my position that there -- that there is such a great difference between education and the law and I don't want to be placed in that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="6696.478" offset="26889279">But nevertheless, this case was at least in part based upon the fact that here were employees, employees of a school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="6706.043" offset="26927522">But when we are dealing with the legal profession, we are not dealing with employees of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="6711.641" offset="26949987">The lawyer is not an employee of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="6713.815" offset="26958660">He is an independent person and the very independence of the lawyer is the reason why the kind of encroachment which the respondent here is endeavoring to make is going to destroy that very independence of the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="6728.229" offset="27016338">Because if they are entitled to ask this kind of a question, what would prevent for instance the Supreme Court of -- or the Committee of Bar Examiners say in Alabama from saying, “Are you a member of the NAACP,” knowing that so far Alabama is concerned, the NAACP believes in overthrowing the -- the kind of -- of status of the Government there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6751.935" offset="27111111">And I submit that you cannot make this kind of an encroachment in the case of a legal profession and still maintain the kind of standards and high moral principle that the legal profession includes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6764.119" offset="27159803">I would like to and I have not the time to do it now, call to the Court's attention the questionnaire which respondent themselves sent out to petitioners here and see whether they included themselves within that good moral character of these political questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6780.108" offset="27223855">They asked the -- every petitioner certain questions in a questionnaire which is included in the record here at page 262.</text>
            <text syncTime="6789.251" offset="27260426">And in this, they went directly to the type of thing which has always been good moral character in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="6796.298" offset="27288534">I submit, Your Honor, that what they have asked him to do, the petitioner here to do is to give up his good moral character, his principles in order to become a man of good moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="6808.344" offset="27336704">And I submit that this is improper and the petitioner should be allowed to be a member of the Bar.</text>
