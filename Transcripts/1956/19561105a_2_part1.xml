            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">Number 2 on the docket, Holophane Company, Incorporated, Appellant, versus United States of America.</text>

            <label>Mr. Attorney General</label>
            <text syncTime="16.163" offset="64575">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.177" offset="80666">This case is a civil antitrust case originating in the Southern District of Ohio and tried before His Honor Mell G. Underwood.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.027" offset="140016">It comes before this Court upon appeal under the Expediting Act of 1903 from an order or judgment in decree entered by Judge Underwood February 8, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.588" offset="222250">A seasonable motion for new trial and other relief after judgment was filed and overruled February 9th, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.833" offset="275331">Thereafter, proceedings were perfected in this Court and jurisdiction noted October 10th, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.072" offset="316186">The complaint charged a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act by a reason of agreements existing between the appellant, which was the sole party defendant in this litigation and two foreign corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.773" offset="434991">In other words, in general classification, this case is a cartel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.702" offset="470727">And yet I might say at the outset that if there ever was a case in which that word should not be endowed with talismanic qualities which preclude an examination under the rule of reason, this case is it.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.908" offset="555572">The appellant, Holophane Company, Inc. is a Delaware Corporation which has a factory in Newark, Ohio and its general offices in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.040" offset="644075">It manufactures prismatic glassware.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.739" offset="666854">That is glassware which is impressed with prismatic contours either in linear or circular form so arranged as to conduce to the projection of light patterns.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.673" offset="762671">I think on some of the exhibits Your Honors will see the slogan, “We turn light into illumination.”</text>
            <text syncTime="200.871" offset="803422">It is the function of this prismatic glassware to direct and focus or diffuse the light which comes from the source.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.849" offset="859324">The products include what are known as reflectors from which the light obviously bounces back, refractors through which the light passes and is bent into one direction or another, and lenses which perform in substance the same function as is performed by refractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.749" offset="982936">Generally speaking, refractors are used out of doors and lenses are used indoors.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.251" offset="1020970">Refractors are a prominent element in the street lighting aspect of the Holophane business about which more will be stated later.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.974" offset="1083873">Those are the physical products which Holophane makes.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.094" offset="1104353">I might add that it not only makes the glass, but to some extent fabricates lighting fixtures which incorporate this prismatic glassware.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.926" offset="1155657">It also sells prismatic glassware to other fabricators of lighting fixtures for incorporation by them in their own structures.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.976" offset="1203827">Because of the oddity of the name, it might be worth just to comment upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.775" offset="1231099">The name, Holophane derives from two Greek combining forms holo, meaning complete, entire, or whole such as in holograph, holocaust and phane meaning to appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.767" offset="1311033">And so the term in combination means wholly apparent or appearing completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.248" offset="1344888">And I might say that I was delighted to find in the multivolume Oxford Dictionary last week that there actually is a word holophanerous meaning wholly apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.957" offset="1407791">The facts in this case as presented in the record below were developed by two witnesses who testified in person.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.318" offset="1465260">One called upon cross-examination by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.833" offset="1491278">The other adduced used by the appellant, the defendant below.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.786" offset="1515102">Both were officers of the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.492" offset="1529940">In addition, there are stipulations and numerous documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.208" offset="1568810">The evidence shows in sum that the Holophane Industries as one might call them or industry stemmed from a meaning in 1892 between an American, Otis A. Mygatt, and a French man named Blondel.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.040" offset="1664104">Professor Blondel had discovered the function performed by the impression of prisms on glassware in the focusing or diffusion of light.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.210" offset="1716767">In 1898, Mr. Mygatt, the American, formed Holophane Glass Company of New Jersey and it proceeded to manufacture prismatic glassware.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.475" offset="1773819">In 1912, Mr. Mygatt formed Holophane Limited, a British corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.793" offset="1831079">Some time between 1912 and 1921, Mr. Mygatt having become a resident of France formed La Societe Anonyme Francaise Holophane.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.811" offset="1899207">He controlled not only Francaise and Limited, but also the American company which he made a fully own subsidiary of Limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.619" offset="1954377">In 1921, there was in an agreement which appears in the record I believe Government's Exhibit 6 between Limited and Francaise in which Limited granted to Francaise the right or exclusive license to sell in a group of countries surrounding France, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.352" offset="2137339">By that agreement, Francaise was not to sell in British territory nor British to sell in French territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.889" offset="2187494">That contract or agreement also provided that Limited was to have a representative on Francaise Board of Directors, with, of course, to have the right to inspect their books.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.611" offset="2242351">Accountings were regularly to have been made and that the contract was to be construed as made under English law with the appointment of an agent for service of process in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.429" offset="2309642">That was the situation which existed in 1925 when appellant's predecessor came into existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.496" offset="2357917">Holophane Glass Company of New Jersey was, as I've indicated at that point a wholly owned subsidiary of Limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.777" offset="2403056">The evidence shows that in 1925, the American management wished to acquire the American property for themselves that negotiations were conducted and a transaction consummated.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.214" offset="2472856">That transaction in the record first evidences itself in an agreement between Limited and one Joel Liberman who was counsel for the American company and was associated with Mr. Charles Franck, then the American manager and now, president of Holophane Company, Incorporated, the appellant herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.661" offset="2638576">Mr. Liberman has passed away.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.203" offset="2652787">In that agreement, which was dated June 1st, 1925, Mr. Liberman acquired the opportunity or option to purchase the assets or the stock of the American company.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.960" offset="2755814">It in that agreement, it was to be cited that there would be reciprocal recognition of trading areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.569" offset="2802207">That agreement was assigned to a New York Corporation known as Holophane Illuminating Company which was formed along in September 25 and which exercised the option in the Liberman agreement so that in September of 1925, Holophane Illuminating Company, the New York corporation acquired from Limited whose negotiator was one Thompson, the General Manager of Limited acquired from it the stock of Holophane Glass Company, the New Jersey corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.970" offset="3003873">Immediately there was a change of name of the New York corporation to Holophane Glass Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.624" offset="3030413">A year or so later, the name was changed to Holophane Company, Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.342" offset="3053296">In 1929, the New York corporation merged into a Delaware corporation which is the present appellant.</text>

            <text syncTime="876.736" offset="3506887">I think thats correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.129" offset="3516500">I think it is only fair to infer from that that in the financing of the purchase of the equity by the American management it was necessary for him to take preferred stock in order that the transaction will go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.741" offset="3590896">In September of 1925 a so-called trading agreement was entered into between the American company and Limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.123" offset="3644395">That agreement which had been referred to in Mr. Liberman's original letter of -- to the company and said that a corresponding agreement might be offered with Francaise included territorial restrictions such that the American company was granted the right to sell Holophane products, all of these companies selling under the name of Holophane, all of them using the same trademark was given the right to sell Holophane products in that area of North America, north of the Panama Canal but exclusive of the West Indies, in Cuba and in Japan, and in the Philippine Islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.941" offset="3879706">That agreement also provided that each party would use its best efforts to prevent exportation for its territory and to the territory of the other that each party would not carry on trade in the territory of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.887" offset="3951491">That each party will neither apply for nor obtain patent or trademark protection in the territory or countries of the other's territory without the request and -- but for the benefit of the other party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.263" offset="4025051">That it will communicate and assign developments, discoveries, designs, and that it will supply the other when requested its products at factory cost plus 30%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.292" offset="4093074">Some few months later, the agreement which had been foreshadowed in Mr. Liberman's letter to the company along the same lines was consummated with Francaise and it was substantially the same sort of agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.488" offset="4161933">Along in 1944 after considerable correspondence and discussion between Limited and Francaise or rather Limited and the appellant about the South American rights to sell Holophane products, Limited granted the right to sell those products in South America to the American company, the appellant for some $40,300.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.966" offset="4307801">At the same time, the agreement of September 15th, 1925, the trading agreement as I've called it, was renewed and it was designated that it would apply to the South American territory acquired by the American company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.844" offset="4407275">Interestingly enough, and in passing, both the original agreement between Mr. Liberman and Limited and the two agreements of 1944 which I have just mentioned, contained clauses which designate that the law of England shall apply and that a firm of solicitors shall be named, in fact, are named upon whom service of process can be made or any matter drawing out of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.290" offset="4569130">In 1945, there was a further modification of the agreements which I have referred to, to take care of the percentages to be paid between Limited and the American company for certain additional work when one called upon the other to ship its goods into the territory of the other or when specification work was done by one company for shipment into the territory of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.897" offset="4707579">Now, in selling its prismatic glassware, Holophane Company, the appellant herein, in essence sells not a physical product but a service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.810" offset="4779154">The record is explicit on that subject note 5 on page 7 of the brief of the Government concedes that fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="3657.419" offset="14629616">In the National Lead case and the Timken case this Court condemned agreements for the provision of markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.794" offset="14659082">And I think it's significant that in the Timken case, as in this case, the agreements for the formation of the French company were entered into between the British company and the American company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.497" offset="14709969">So that the fact that you had -- had at the time of the execution of the agreements common control and common ownership of these company, does not save them from a concerned condemnation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.406" offset="14765558">Furthermore, there's nothing in this record to support the suggestion that if it hadn't been for these restricted provisions, the American company would never have been created.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.938" offset="14823654">Some of the participants in this transaction were available as witnesses at the time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.761" offset="14842984">They were not called.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.188" offset="14848731">As far as the record in this case shows, we have an agreement for the sale of a portion of a business followed by an agreement not to compete, followed nine months later by an agreement not to compete with a third company that wasn't even a party to these negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.096" offset="14924382">So we think that under the -- this Court's repeated holdings, these agreements are per se illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.641" offset="14954475">And we don't think that even if they were to be examined under the rule of reason, this can be justified as appellant seeks to do as an ancillary of strength.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.767" offset="14995017">They're not limited in time, they're of indefinite duration, they're in existence at the time of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.410" offset="15017587">They're not limited to territories where the companies were doing business, but broadly extended to the whole world.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.390" offset="15041515">They contained numerous other restricted provisions going beyond merely staying out of the market areas, and finally, the agreements included a party which was not concerned directly with the transaction that's fair.</text>
