          <heading>Argument of Wilbur E. Dow, Jr.</heading>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="22.861">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Dow, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Wilbur E. Dow, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="22.861" offset="194853">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.004" offset="207391">I think it would help the Court a little to understand what this thing is all about, before we go any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.893" offset="234977">When the Haiti Victory cut through the bow of the Duke of York one night in the English Channel, as you might suppose a lot of people were killed, injured, and lost their property.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.986" offset="295267">Now, you have heard here that a 104 out of the 115 were from other parts of the world, even as far away as Australia, so to let them sue over there if they want to collect anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.427" offset="361096">But five out of the eight people that died were Americans and they constitute the bulk of these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.561" offset="401638">Now, it would also help if we knew just what happens in Europe, when you have limitation of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.904" offset="443016">You don't have it as a label on the first proceeding as you often do here, it comes afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.392" offset="480946">The first thing you do, everyone's who's everybody else, just as we usually do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.029" offset="507486">And after there are suits, and cross-claims, and counterclaims, the Court decides the issue of liability and determines under their rules just who was liable and to what extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.327" offset="560671">After that is completed, the ship owner looks at the Bill that's presented to him and then decide whether or not he's going to limit, which is a sensible thing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.071" offset="607692">I think in a sense, we have the cart before the horse here very often.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.838" offset="626709">But we overcome that by frequently using limitation of liability as a defense like under the Jahncke and that case stands for the proposition that you can use it either way and I submit that there isn't a slightest doubt that British Transport can limit now if it wants to, because for the first time there are claims against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.998" offset="719391">There weren't before.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.444" offset="733184">Now, the difficultly here originally arose because of the fact that there was a Government involved and a British vessel which our Government thought was likewise a British Government ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.236" offset="796296">So they thought it came under the Knock-for-Knock Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.913" offset="811029">Consequently, there were some confusion and the thing didn't proceed exactly as an ordinary case of this kind would proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.445" offset="853138">Ordinarily, they would have waited until the vessel got where she was going, the Brooklyn Navy Yard for repairs and then British Transport's counsel whose office was there would've label it.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.421" offset="901099">The Government would've come back and answered limited, and claimed against the British for their damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.083" offset="951672">We would've come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.659" offset="958046">And I only represent the people that were injured, killed and, lost there baggage.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.422" offset="981034">Mr. Doub will speak for the Government's aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.245" offset="996394">So we would've then come in and filed our claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.318" offset="1020635">And under Rule 43, we'd file them against anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.840" offset="1038712">Now, we don't have any admiralty, the equivalent of Rule 13 (g) of the civil rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.980" offset="1067342">So, for one to have a better, we used Rule 56 or sometimes 54 and have for 75 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.937" offset="1099107">It goes back, it used to be Rule 59.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.262" offset="1112377">At first, as the petitioner pointed out, yes, it was designed for collision.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.793" offset="1142575">But it was quickly spread to cargo and then to all sorts of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.816" offset="1162637">Now, if we had the European and British system of determining liability before we determine whether or not we were going to limit, we wouldn't require the equivalent of Rule 56 or -- or its -- its liberal use.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.481" offset="1233272">Who wouldn't need it?</text>
            <text syncTime="284.404" offset="1241004">Because all that would be done under the -- under perhaps a very clear rules permitting implead or in cross-libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.213" offset="1276217">But just assume as we have, as I say, the cart before the horse, we have to use Rule 56 rather liberally in order to get all people before the Court, have a concourse of claims, determine liability all around and then apportion whatever is before the Court for apportionment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3527.712" offset="14214248">First of all, may I straighten out a few matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.109" offset="14227832">In regard to the discussion that we had a moment ago about my statement that in a 106 years, no dollar had been collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.484" offset="14265344">One of my distinguished opponents thought that I lifted that from Judge Hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.788" offset="14286555">There isn't -- find a man to lift something from that one was lifting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.599" offset="14301811">But I was making his statement on my own authority and I was saying that having looked -- I think in every case that's been decided, there is not one where a dollar has been collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.404" offset="14340995">And if we just take this reason or one that Mr. Doub was talking about, you'll see why he said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.611" offset="14365863">These -- these ideas and decision that he's talking about are interlocutory orders and in this case that the Woolsey, it is quite true, there was an interlocutory order that some claimants might come in and file a claim against any proceeds which remained in the hands in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.527" offset="14441514">But the fact of the matter is that there were no proceeds in the hands of the Court because the Steel Inventor was declared innocent, there was no fault there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.532" offset="14477458">Therefore, in its proceeding the -- there was no fund to distribute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.349" offset="14500760">The United States Destroyer, Woolsey, was at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean and since it did not carry freight, the fund that could have been distributed on account of the Woolsey was zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.975" offset="14547257">And therefore, although, United States was found at fault and although people could have claimed, if there had been anything to claim, nobody did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.686" offset="14586128">Now, the same thing is true of these other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.762" offset="14598457">Now, one other matter to straighten up, which at least confused me and the responses to some questions asked by Mr. Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.442" offset="14633148">I got the idea that the response was made that if the British Transport Commission had not come to the United States, but it remained in England when this indication proceeding was started, the results of the Courts decision would have been res judicata against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.088" offset="14707754">Now, that of course cannot be settled, the -- no one can be bound by the judgment of the Court, it was not in Court in present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.861" offset="14746833">And if this, Your Honors, raises the whole basis of -- of this argument that the purpose of limitation procedures is to bring in to court everybody who has a claim against a limited fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.228" offset="14808273">Now, so far as the American citizens are concerned, our courts can enjoin them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.722" offset="14834291">They can say, “You must come in here or be defaulted, and you cannot go into any other court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.081" offset="14859682">But our courts can't control people who are not in the United States, you can't default somebody who isn't in your court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.292" offset="14888521">You can't enjoin somebody who is in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.659" offset="14902000">And therefore, these foreign claimants, after they induced to come into these proceedings, and it's highly important that the proceedings should be of such a nature that they will come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.590" offset="14953723">Now, in considering whether to come in, if a claimant is going to find himself, defending himself against all other claimants in the suit he will say, “No, I think I'll just wait.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.809" offset="14998653">But as there will be another ship that will come to England before long and I will file a suit against that ship and attach it again a fund in Court, and then -- and have another proceeding in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.645" offset="15049958">And therefore, the whole purpose of the limitation of liability statutes would be defeated that you would not have succeeded in bringing into one proceeding all the claims against one shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.368" offset="15100844">And that's why it is so important to do one thing at a time and not try to solve all the issues which possibly could arise.</text>

            <text syncTime="3773.537" offset="15197497">The difference would be, Your Honor, that if both ships were American ships or if the British were present in the United States, then an independent suit could be filed against that shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.285" offset="15252564">Once that libel had been filed, the court had taken jurisdiction, the proceedings could be transferred to the same court and consolidate that the whole question here is can you get hold of the person who is sought to be impleaded?</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.002" offset="15319333">And we say that if that person is in the United States, two American ship companies in New York, one starts a limitation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.419" offset="15369070">If the other one is at fault, he will start an independent suit against the other one and then consolidate the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.515" offset="15397386">But you cannot serve them merely because he is in the limitation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.592" offset="15421733">Now, this becomes important in regard to foreigners, because they are not in the United States except as they come in for the limited purpose of the limited liability proceeding.</text>
