            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 426, Jesse Blackburn, Petitioner, versus the State of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.090" offset="171760">Mr. Hobbs.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="truman_m_hobbs" startTime="18.186" stopTime="802.064">
            <label>Mr. Truman M. Hobbs</label>
            <text syncTime="18.186" offset="176149">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.354" offset="184822">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.192" offset="188165">I represent the petitioner in this case, Jesse Blackburn.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.398" offset="204988">Jesse Blackburn was convicted of the crime of robbery in the State of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.569" offset="233618">The crime for which he was convicted was a brutal one.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.254" offset="248351">It involved the armed assault and serious injury to the operator of a rolling country store in the rural county of Colbert County.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.920" offset="303104">It was the contention of Jesse Blackburn in his trial and it has been throughout the appellate procedures in Alabama that his conviction rested on a confession of it -- the admission of a confession into evidence was improper that the confession was involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.988" offset="387323">And in our petition for certiorari, we had the consideration of that question by this Court whether the confession in that case was involuntary and therefore violated the Due Process Clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.715" offset="442284">The facts -- the immediate facts surrounding the confession of Jesse Blackburn all came from the Deputy Sheriff who took that confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.175" offset="484080">This was true because Jesse Blackburn testified in the trial and stated that he had no recollection whatsoever of the circumstances surrounding that confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.135" offset="531937">In fact, he testified that he had no recollection of anything that had occurred for several months prior to his confession and for several months thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.290" offset="572583">This was not an inconsistent statement for Jesse Blackburn to make because his medical records in -- from Government insane hospital showed that recurrently Jesse Blackburn suffered from complete amnesia for long periods of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.065" offset="643636">So then again, as to the immediate facts surrounding that confession, we take it entirely from the testimony of the Deputy Sheriff who obtained the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.697" offset="682193">His testimony showed that shortly sometime after Jesse Blackburn's arrest, he was confined to jail in Colbert County and was taken into a small room there in the jail, which he described as a room four feet by six feet or six feet by eight feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.408" offset="769024">We call it a table size room and he was interrogated there by the -- this Deputy Sheriff and two other police officers whom he said came in and out for some nine or 10 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.895" offset="834957">The testimony of the Deputy was that they did knock off the questioning for about an hour while they had supper.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.686" offset="866095">And after supper, the -- the questioning continued until 10 or 11 o'clock at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.120" offset="895875">In its brief filed in this Court, the State of Alabama has suggested that the only person that questioned Jesse during all this period of time was this Deputy Sheriff Stanford.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.792" offset="942582">The record itself discloses, however, that the Deputy Sheriff stated that there were these other law enforcement officers who were coming in and out and that in answer to a question as to whether any of these law enforcement officers asked questions, he said they might have asked some questions and then the question was asked, did these questions relate to the facts in this case and his answer was yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.808" offset="1066611">So we think here that without any real question, we have a situation where this man was questioned almost unceasingly for nine or 10 hours by relays of law enforcement officers in this table sized room in this jail down in Colbert County.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.101" offset="1147800">We think such a confession, even if Jesse Blackburn had been a person of normal will and mind, would raise substantial doubts as to whether it would square with the constitutional requirements of due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.843" offset="1210702">But in this case we don't have a person who was of sound mind or sound will.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.266" offset="1244453">Jesse Blackburn was a young Negro, 25 years old when this alleged crime was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.022" offset="1271411">He had been in the Armed Services during World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.792" offset="1286562">And in 1944, he was discharged from the Army as permanently mentally defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.240" offset="1324283">The Army Medical Board that surveyed him out of the Army, recommended that he be transferred to a government insane institution, and he went from the Army to a government insane institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.811" offset="1386663">The diagnosis at that time for Jesse Blackburn was that he was a victim of dementia praecox which in other places they call schizophrenia, simple type, that he had a history of hallucinations and defective judgment and insight.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.730" offset="1450297">And Jesse Blackburn remained in this government insane institution from 1944 until sometime in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.723" offset="1498258">In November 1946, the medical -- the government hospital rated Jesse Blackburn 100% mentally incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.346" offset="1544756">In February of 1948, he was released into the custody of his sister for a 10-day leave from the insane hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.123" offset="1591881">When the 10 days was up, Jesse didn't return to the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.077" offset="1615705">Instead a short time thereafter, he left his home in Chicago and came to Alabama to attend the funeral of his brother.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.551" offset="1669622">It was -- while he was on this trip to Alabama, that the crime for which he was convicted was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.210" offset="1708178">His medical records at this government insane hospital state, however, and they automatically discharged Jesse when he didn't return after 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.912" offset="1747048">His medical record stated that on his discharge "the diagnosis of schizophrenic reaction, paranoid type, remains unchanged."</text>
            <text syncTime="422.459" offset="1793233">And he was considered incompetent at the time of his release.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.076" offset="1819669">Now, we think it's significant in this case that this issue of insanity was not first raised by petitioner's counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.085" offset="1863764">It was raised by the very persons who obtained the confession from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.790" offset="1890513">It was raised by the jailer and the Deputy Sheriff, and the Sheriff who watched him there in the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.502" offset="1917367">They testified that a short time or some little time or we don't know exactly the period, but it couldn't have been more than a few days or very few weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.480" offset="1957282">They communicated to the Circuit Judge in Colbert County that Jesse showed signs of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.817" offset="1986644">And the Circuit Judge called in certain lay persons in the community and three local doctors to examine Jesse Blackburn.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.797" offset="2026559">All of the persons who examined him apparently found reasonable grounds for believing him insane.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.565" offset="2057592">The two doctors, there's a statement from them in the record, they weren't psychiatrist, they were just medical doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.983" offset="2087267">They stated that in their judgment Jesse Blackburn was not mentally able to stand trial at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.327" offset="2116629">On receiving these communications, the Circuit Judge, pursuant to the statute of Alabama, had Jesse transferred to the State Insane Hospital and a sanity commission was appointed which had as its head, the Superintendent of the State Mental Hospitals in Alabama, Dr. Tarwater.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.381" offset="2200848">Dr. Tarwater pointed the other two members of this sanity commission that examined Jesse Blackburn.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.776" offset="2226448">After their examination and they kept Jesse Blackburn in -- under observation for some months before rendering a report, they were unanimous in their conclusion that Jesse Blackburn was insane when he was examined by the sanity commission, that in their judgment he was insane when the alleged crime was committed and in their judgement, he was insane when his confession was received.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.683" offset="2362075">The respondent in its brief has suggested that there's a conflict in the testimony of the three doctors on that commission in their depositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.533" offset="2405543">He find such conflict from the statement of one of the doctors, Dr. Richards, that in his judgment, Jesse Blackburn did not show -- was at all times normal.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.393" offset="2468968">And that is the statement of Dr. Richards, that in his judgement, Jesse Blackburn was at all times normal.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.006" offset="2499375">On the same deposition, however, Dr. Richards stated -- reaffirmed the position he'd taken in his report that Jesse Blackburn was insane when he first examined him, was insane when the crime was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.519" offset="2569488">And I think the only logical way to square Dr. Richards' testimony not with the testimony of the other doctors, but with his other testimony on that deposition was that he viewed Jesse Blackburn's normal condition as that of insane.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.802" offset="2634585">This is strengthened when it is also noted that Dr. Richards was asked, does -- did you ever observe Jesse Blackburn when he was having a lucid interval?</text>
            <text syncTime="644.339" offset="2680769">And he said that in his judgment Jesse Blackburn had no lucid intervals.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.351" offset="2716818">Respondent makes a further effort to minimize the report of the sanity commission by suggesting that Dr. Rowe, one of the other doctors that examined him, conceded that he didn't see him too often or words to that effect that he saw him on his general rounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.934" offset="2791111">But what Dr. Rowe said was, and I'm quoting that he had petitioner “continuously under observation from the time of his admission to the hospital until his discharge.”</text>
            <text syncTime="686.493" offset="2849311">He stated that on many occasions, he interviewed Jesse Blackburn for quite sometime, for interviews that lasted more than an hour in duration and in on other times, he just saw him on his general ward rounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.600" offset="2901765">On the basis of this lunacy commission's report, Jesse Blackburn was committed to the insane hospitals in Alabama and he remained on an insane institution from July 1948 until November 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.997" offset="2983372">He was actually in the insane hospital for more than four years being treated for his insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.930" offset="3015137">That was under an order of the Circuit Court of Colbert County which directed that he be turned over to the insane hospital “permanently" or until restored to sanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.492" offset="3085354">In 1952, the sanity commission reported back to the Court that at that time, Jesse appeared to be restored to sanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.625" offset="3141883">And then he was brought back and put to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.431" offset="3169050">Now, the State of Alabama recognized the time honored rule that you don't try insane people.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.385" offset="3196949">And for that reason, they put Jesse Blackburn where he belong in an insane institution for some four-and-a-half years.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.090" offset="3231744">But when they said he was restored to sanity, they sent him back to trial and convicted him on a confession, which in the opinion of all the medical evidence in the case, was obtained at a time when he was insane.</text>

            <text syncTime="810.980" offset="3347310">In Alabama, the Court passes on the matter of -- of whether the confession was voluntarily or involuntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.168" offset="3388061">The Court ruled that it was voluntary despite the fact that all the medical testimony, these depositions of the doctors that had the lunacy report, and all of this, it ruled that it was voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.387" offset="3440933">Then the confession was admitted in evidence and it went to the jury under instructions which said that there was a claim of insanity in the case and then unless they -- they could give whatever weight they desired to the confession.</text>

            <text syncTime="869.367" offset="3580844">We think that surely if the law protects a defendant from standing trial when he is insane, at which time he, in a capital case such as this, he would be protected by the Court and protected by court appointed counsel that due process extends to a confession which was obtained at a time when he was mentally insane.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.034" offset="3711457">Now, if this confession was not obtained at a time when petitioner was insane, we submit this Court will never have an opportunity to pass on a case where such is the situation because the only evidence in this case that petitioner was otherwise than a mentally deranged person.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.206" offset="3808214">All of his medical history showed his mentally derangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.439" offset="3821171">His four-and-a-half years incarceration for mental disorder after his confession shows it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2703.886" offset="10918954">Honorable Chief Justice and if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.261" offset="10948420">After entering all of the suggestion, my position in this case, the implication of the State of Alabama is and there was a place in the fact which was decided by the trial judge first and then again by the trial jury as to whether or not this petitioner was insane at the time he confessed on the one hand and -- and the time of the crime on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.778" offset="11154474">Now, that question of fact of rightness we submit in this matter on page 32 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.411" offset="11228975">The -- is the -- about the man which the prosecutor faced attempted to introduce a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.251" offset="11296371">Now, on that page the Deputy Sheriff who received the confession testified and the -- there was no threshold rule on interval.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.945" offset="11371186">He testified to enough, to rebut the presumption that it was involuntary in a normal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.298" offset="11416534">Now, at that point, the defense objected and offered evidence on voir dire after a question that the jury be excused on voir dire examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.137" offset="11503888">Now, in the offer of what they were going to prove on voir dire there, they mentioned the records of the Veterans Administration as to Jesse Blackburn's mental condition in years past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.004" offset="11607437">Actually, when they got into offering the evidence, that evidence of the records of the Veterans Administration were not presented on voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.039" offset="11679535">Therefore, the only thing that the defense offered on voir dire were the two depositions of two of the members of the lunacy commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.599" offset="11749752">The defense did not even offer the deposition of the third member of the lunacy commission and it's obvious that the reason they didn't do any of this, his answers were conflicting with the other two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.381" offset="11840867">They would have entered in a peculiar position had they offered an oath through each definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.291" offset="11884544">The State on voir dire offered the deposition of the third doctor whose evidence conflicted with the other two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.121" offset="11943894">And in addition, continued to examine the Deputy Sheriff Stanford on voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.511" offset="12001468">Now, at the end of that voir dire examination, that is when the trial judge made his determination that the confession should be received in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.667" offset="12094046">And one of Your Honors asked Mr. Hobbs whether he makes any at all a determination as I understood it as to mental insanity, he did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.928" offset="12183071">The jury, you see, has not even been present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.644" offset="12209925">They've been away from the courtroom, then they come back and the judge merely allows the objection -- the confession in evidence over the objection of the defendant to support the juries' concern up to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.123" offset="12327894">They have no implication, no evidence before them as to the man's mental condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.701" offset="12374183">Now, on -- on this voir dire examination in the case at bar, we have as Mr. Hobbs stated statements showing that Jesse Blackburn was sane from the Deputy Sheriff -- I think that -- when he was cross-examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.684" offset="12518066">His -- his testimony on voir dire begins on page 99.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.116" offset="12563832">He was examined and cross-examined on the sanity proposition on voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.487" offset="12589328">Now, in addition to his testimony, we have as I have mentioned the depositions of the three doctors, two, introduce by the defendant and one by the State below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.824" offset="12770617">The report of the lunacy commission and that's all it is, it's a report to the trial judge for his guidance in deciding whether or not to put this man to trial or to send him to the hospital until he can stand trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.934" offset="12895065">The report of this commission was that the petitioner was insane.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.853" offset="12938742">Defendant was insane at the time of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.607" offset="12961834">But now, when you get to the voir dire examination, these interrogatories which were introduced by these doctors on voir dire, you -- you run into the conflict which we say is in the evidence in this case and I've mentioned a few question on fact which was properly left by the Alabama Court of Appeals to the trial judge in the trial jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="3533.265" offset="14236400">He was asked about this -- the petitioner's mental conditions on the date of the crime and he said they were normal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.757" offset="14282376">He was asked about his mental condition on April 8th, 1948, the date of the confession and his words were it was good.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.300" offset="14348622">For that reason, I beg to disagree with Mr. Hobbs in his interpretation that normal mental -- he was normally insane.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.413" offset="14409017">I can't read that into it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.922" offset="14423019">If that were true, surely, the word good would amend that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.490" offset="14461367">Now, the other two doctors testimony were more damaging to the State than was Dr. Richards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.034" offset="14511522">But Dr. Rowe stated that he was more normal than it is normal and that he had lucid intervals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.014" offset="14579440">But I think and submit for the State of Alabama that the significant part of these depositions lie in the answers of the doctors which clearly show that the -- they didn't give much time to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.910" offset="14686960">They -- they -- of course I know nothing about medicine but I -- I don't see how when the man is committed and when the doctors take six months to report, how they can testify this -- what the Dr. Tarwater says, “I saw him at most two or two-and-a-half hours would cover the entire time that I joined during his stay in the hospital."</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.770" offset="14862503">Dr. Richards when this -- explicit and he gives that (Inaudible), "I didn't see him very often."</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.736" offset="14906284">The other doctor says, "I saw -- saw him maybe twice a week but some of those times were on general ward rounds."</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.957" offset="14971173">I submit that that could be considered probably by the trial judge on voir dire and by the jury in the case in chief as going to the weight of the report made by the lunacy commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.270" offset="15072423">Now, Mr. Justice Whittaker asked about the adjudication aspect of that report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.613" offset="15133863">That report is -- is not an adjudication of insanity, it's a gap for the trial judge in determining whether or not the man can be put on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.830" offset="15198647">Now, even when the depositions were offered in the case in chief when they were offered on voir dire, the report was attached as an exception to the deposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3796.682" offset="15290075">But under implications in Alabama the report cannot be offered in the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.078" offset="15327692">So when they came to offer the depositions in evidence in the case in chief before the jury, the judge refused to allow the report to go in and as they properly so -- because there is no adjudication, it is to say the least an ex parte matter (Inaudible) cross-examination and then should not be in evidence and what's not in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.427" offset="15497070">Now, what we have in this case is a trial judge, who he is -- the evidence of three doctors and the testimony of the Deputy Sheriff, that with all those offered to him on voir dire then he makes a determination in the essence of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.580" offset="15673657">He says at the confession, “If voluntary, we'll receive and bring the jury back again."</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.622" offset="15709811">The jury back again and all of that evidence were reintroduced before them and in addition thereto that is where the records of the Veterans Administration were introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3924.690" offset="15802180">The trial judge, at the time he -- he made his determination, knew nothing of those records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.763" offset="15838438">He couldn't have known.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.078" offset="15847633">They were introduced later but even so, the jury honorably are not guilty by insanity not only found him guilty but one of Your Honors as Mr. Hobbs, about the full determination aspect even after the trial judge had admitted the confession into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.141" offset="16023907">He charges the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.138" offset="16035924">That's on page 234 of the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="3997.712" offset="16094229">Begins now and gentlemen, the State introducing the evidence in written paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.051" offset="16143548">And that goes on to the end of that paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="4016.138" offset="16167894">Now, at the very end, he is telling the jury this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4022.574" offset="16193703">He said if the defendant signed -- signed the paper, he -- you make up your minds, these things, if the jury signed the paper, was he insane in denying he's not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4041.558" offset="16269563">If the defendant signed the paper and he had the known capacity of knowing and to remember that which he was saying is empirical?</text>
            <text syncTime="4055.055" offset="16323584">Then he goes on down, beginning the second sentence in the next paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="4064.477" offset="16361305">He said gentlemen, the jury, if you reach the affirmative answers, says this in substance, if you reach the affirmative answers to the those questions that I have asked you above, do not give any weight to the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="4091.940" offset="16471124">So even after he -- and made his determination that the confession was voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4102.198" offset="16512188">He is still in that sense leaves it up to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4108.733" offset="16538311">Now, I think that that is perfectly proper under to our practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4120.220" offset="16584286">We have in line of cases which holds that any evidence offered on voir dire can go to the admissibility of the confession in the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4138.676" offset="16658056">However, the cases say that if the defendant waits and holds back evidence or doesn't introduce the evidence as was done in this case in regard to the Veterans Administration records, if you hold it by -- until after the end of the Board trial examination, then the evidence that you do introduce in the case in chief goes only to the weight of the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="4183.560" offset="16837569">And I think that that is the reason that the trial judge was so implicit in his charge to the jury and it is important that we just examine because he realize that you gentlemen, the jury he was saying, have before you much more evidence in regard to this man's insanity then I have before me, when I allowed the confession in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4226.632" offset="17009873">In any case, there was still a question of fact because of the testimony of the Deputy Sheriff and because of the conflict in the lack of observation made by the -- by the lunacy commission and because the jury told the defendant on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="4258.180" offset="17136097">And it was true, it was four years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="4263.645" offset="17157935">However, they were in a much better position than it was in the Court of Appeals of Alabama and seeing him, the other witness' plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4280.743" offset="17226376">And my interpretation of the decision of the Court -- Court of Appeals of Alabama differs from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.912" offset="17283009">And mentioned by Mr. Hobbs, when he says that when they talk about the discretion below, they're measuring it in conjunction with the rule that was mentioned by Mr. Justice Brennan a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="4321.335" offset="17388753">To me, the -- the Court of Appeals is saying that you (Inaudible) your conflict, the lack of evidence down there, we as the Court of Appeals of Alabama don't know whether this man was insane or not under the record and we can't determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4345.945" offset="17487182">It's not up to us to determine, a new trial judge and you trial jury have already made that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.687" offset="17534098">And since this record has conflicting evidence in it, we won't disturb your determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4369.132" offset="17579865">That is the way I interpret the -- the decision of the Court of Appeals of Alabama.</text>

            <text syncTime="4382.523" offset="17633468">Perhaps, it will bear on the decision but in the absence of this confession, is there enough in the record to sustain the conviction?</text>

            <text syncTime="4392.007" offset="17671398">I would have to answer substantially like Mr. Hobbs did by stating that the trial judge submitted it in his instructions to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4408.645" offset="17737958">He said that if you don't find at the confession, if you don't give any weight to the confession, then you have -- your case must be based on circumstantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4428.488" offset="17817370">Then the case would be much weaker, much, much weaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="4432.889" offset="17834924">I will be the first to admit that but I do think that there's enough in this record to make a jury question without the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="4449.023" offset="17899499">I do not think that a general charge would have probably been given in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4474.931" offset="18003048">The -- as I've stated in the evidence which comes in after the conclusion of voir dire only goes to the weight of the confession on our practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4494.031" offset="18079535">Now, the last motion to exclude this confession and there were a number -- number of them, number of objection and motion to exclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="4510.355" offset="18144841">The last one in this record was made when the State rested its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4520.593" offset="18185697">In other words, before all of the testimonies which the defense had in regard to insanity was before for the Court and throughout they knew -- knew nothing on the Veterans' records at the time of the last motion to exclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="4567.776" offset="18374510">The trial judge not only pointed out in his instructions to the jury the parts that I have mentioned just a moment ago by the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="4590.521" offset="18465416">But in addition, he was -- given their clear instruction as to the jury's duty on the plea of insanity without regard to the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="4614.908" offset="18563009">In other words, the only thing that I am saying here is that the jury had before it all of -- the attention was brought vividly to the question of insanity all through this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4638.835" offset="18658722">Now, I submit that the question of insanity, the question of the -- in whether I'm right in my interpretation that we had a question of fact or whether I'm wrong is the only thing in this case here in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4676.068" offset="18807620">Now, the petitioner attempts in brief to bring in within some of the decision of this Court, notably Turner versus Pennsylvania, Harris versus South Carolina and like cases, but I submit it is not in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4709.118" offset="18939800">The petitioner was questioned on May the 8th, 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="4722.194" offset="18992149">The Deputy Sheriff was testifying in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="4729.945" offset="19023182">He said, I can't remember the exact times but as -- I was talking to judges sometime after lunch, probably about 1 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="4744.691" offset="19082115">He said, I know we took both down to the supper.</text>
            <text syncTime="4749.073" offset="19099669">He says, “Well, you could think about it, about an hour."</text>
            <text syncTime="4755.065" offset="19123597">And he said I questioned him after supper from probably about 7 o'clock or maybe 10 or 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="4769.622" offset="19181902">The confession was handwritten by the Deputy Sheriff.</text>
            <text syncTime="4778.263" offset="19216384">It's a 10-page confession and detailed very vividly, the trip from Chicago, Illinois back to after the defendant was arrested in carrying the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4802.479" offset="19313246">The confession has many misspelled words or many grammatical errors, it was a terrible penmanship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4819.568" offset="19381687">The only reason I'm bringing that out is to put this point forward that the Deputy Sheriff obviously was not an educated man.</text>
            <text syncTime="4833.322" offset="19436648">Obviously, he did not write this 10-page confession in 15 and 20 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4843.698" offset="19478131">It -- it took a man of his education much longer to write this confession and get it down in writing than it would have a stenographer say or even someone who could just -- writing with the average speed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4866.477" offset="19569246">I'm bringing that out to say that most of this time, not most of course but some of this time as basically that night of May 8th were not taken up with questioning Jesse Blackburn but rather was taken up with getting forward, Jesse Blackburn said down in writing because we don't know exactly how much time that takes off.</text>
            <text syncTime="4905.581" offset="19725667">But this isn't all of this question and even if the man had had a stenographer there didn't amount to but nine or 10 hours and there was no showing that the man was coerced in any manner whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="4931.830" offset="19830680">And the petitioner tries to -- to bring in relay questioning in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4943.277" offset="19876446">Well, I submit that the record just doesn't bear that out at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4949.688" offset="19902151">Deputy Sheriff Stanford says, “I am the one who received his confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="4958.385" offset="19936946">I'm the one who talked to this man.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4961.715" offset="19950216">Yes, the Sheriff and another -- another Deputy were there at some time but I was their all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4973.021" offset="19995460">And he said in answer to a question said, yes, they might have asked some questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4984.773" offset="20042480">This was four years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="4987.538" offset="20053556">He was remembering that he talked to this defendant, that he was the man who received this man's confession and wrote it down, but he wouldn't -- he wouldn't say and for sure that they didn't come in and hear us talking.</text>
            <text syncTime="5010.390" offset="20144880">And I asked the question as amended that all this record bear it out on any question of relay questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="5026.449" offset="20209142">There were no evidence of any cruelties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5029.866" offset="20222830">There were no evidence of any loss of sleep or denial of food.</text>
            <text syncTime="5041.196" offset="20268178">This record just doesn't bear it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="5058.998" offset="20339336">We submit, if it please the Court, that this case has one -- in which as I have said in lieu of the question of fact and that question was, was this defendant or was he not insane?</text>
            <text syncTime="5090.518" offset="20465455">We submit that the trial court afforded the defendant below every legal opportunity to go forward with the evidence in any -- every legal manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5111.660" offset="20549987">Now, that the defendant did present his evidence and that evidence was in conflict with other evidence in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5128.413" offset="20617070">And that therefore, the Court of Appeals rightfully held that the trial judge and the trial jury had merely decided a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5149.256" offset="20700348">Now, we would be the first to admit that if this man was insane, of course all cases, your cases and the cases in the Courts of Alabama and the cases everywhere say that he can't confess if he was insane.</text>
            <text syncTime="5173.852" offset="20798777">Since there was a question of fact as to whether or not he was insane in this case, both at the time he confessed and at the time of crime, answers in both those questions have been determined under the practice of Alabama by the trial judge and then again by the trial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5203.344" offset="20916746">We submit that the decision of the Court of Appeals of Alabama did not violate any right generally to this petitioner by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="5242.528" offset="21073481">The only evidence presented by the State of Alabama that this man was not insane, despite the reports of the numerous doctors who examined him, the Veterans Administration and then the government insane hospital plus the State of Alabama's doctors convened pursuant to the Court's order, all found him insane.</text>
            <text syncTime="5261.064" offset="21147669">The only evidence to the contrary was the statement by the man who took his confession.</text>

            <text syncTime="5298.603" offset="21297821">I suppose -- I don't know that there was a finding of the sanity commission whether there'd be an adjudication or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5307.611" offset="21333765">It would be a loose use of the word “adjudicate”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5310.325" offset="21344632">There was that finding by the sanity commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5313.804" offset="21358634">But as to this question of the conflict and I'm about to sit down, I know my time is nearly up.</text>
            <text syncTime="5319.316" offset="21380681">The -- on page 226 of the record, this Dr. Richards says the State of Alabama relies on for having a conflicting opinion about Jesse Blackburn's insanity, was asked a question, “Is it not a fact, Dr. Richards, from your observation of Jesse Blackburn that he at times had lucid intervals?</text>
            <text syncTime="5339.111" offset="21459780">The answer - "I do not think so."</text>
            <text syncTime="5342.036" offset="21471483">That's the same doctor who said he was insane on all the occasions that the other doctor said he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="5348.012" offset="21495411">And may I point out that in the cases of Haley, in the case of Fikes, in the case of Stein, there's no requirement in order to find that the confession be determined as involuntary that the man have to be insane.</text>
            <text syncTime="5361.980" offset="21551313">And I think this record adequately supports the conclusion that he was insane and really no other conclusion as it seems to me to be possible but this Court does not require insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5372.651" offset="21593945">It only requires that the pressures brought to bear be greater than the power of the -- of resistance of the party who is being interrogated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5380.614" offset="21625814">And there isn't any dispute that this man had spent his entire adult life in an insane hospital and that he'd been -- he had been found insane by everybody who had ever examined him with medical competence to examine.</text>
            <text syncTime="5392.814" offset="21674611">The State of Alabama introduced no evidence any way in his trial, despite the findings of its own three doctors that he was insane.</text>
            <text syncTime="5399.438" offset="21701151">They could have him examined by somebody else if they had any doubt about the correctness of those findings but there was no medical testimony to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5407.210" offset="21732185">They simplify found this, submitted it to the jury and then said that so much discretion is in the trial court and there's a finding of fact and so this Board goes off for 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5415.804" offset="21766562">Thank you.</text>
