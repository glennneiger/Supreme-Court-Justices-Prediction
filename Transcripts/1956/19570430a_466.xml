            <label>Mr. Thomas G. Meeker</label>
            <text syncTime="11.263" offset="148459">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.335" offset="164760">May I call to the Court's attention at the outset that we have handed out for the Court's convenience and have also distributed to counsel a compendium of those unpublished releases of the Commission under the Holding Company Act referred to in our brief, as well as a copy of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.751" offset="286386">This case is here on certiorari to the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.837" offset="306761">It involves an extraordinary situation whereby the respondent, Louisiana Public Service Commission, through the device of appealing from a 1955 order of our Commission which merely denied a petition to reopen obtained in the court below more than two years after the time for review had expired, review of a 1953 S.E.C. order entered pursuant to Section 11 (b) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.257" offset="460361">The anomaly created by the court's decision below is even more obvious if the Court considers for a moment what would happen -- what would have happen if instead of having filed a petition to reopen in 1955, the respondent Louisiana Commission had filed a petition for review in an appropriate Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.023" offset="579480">There can be no question but what if under Section 24 of the Act, that if the petition for review had been filed in 1955, the Court would have to dismiss that petition for one of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.807" offset="650637">Now, there are two orders that are involved in this case, although there is one order which was on review before the -- initially on review before the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.360" offset="700792">The first of the orders which I referred to was our Commission's order of March 1953 which was entered pursuant to Section 11 (b) (1) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act referred to and included in the appendix to our brief at page 49 which directed the intervening respondent, the Middle South Utilities, Inc., and -- a registered holding company and its wholly owned subsidiary, the respondent, Louisiana Power &amp; Light Company, to divest themselves of Louisiana powers non-electric assets pursuant to Section 11 (b) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="201.029" offset="907473">I might call the Court's attention to the Commission's opinion which is found at page 103 of the transcript of record as well as the Commission's order which is found at page 127, and calling the Court's particular attention to page 128 in the latter part of the Commission's order of 1953, I would like the Court's indulgence just to read the language there, a part of the language of that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.993" offset="1051355">It is ordered pursuant to Section 11 (b) (1) of the Act that Middle South and its subsidiaries, one of which is Louisiana Power, dispose their cause -- the disposition of their direct and indirect ownership in the non-electric properties owned by Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi in any appropriate manner not in contravention of the applicable provisions of the Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas G. Meeker</label>
            <text syncTime="280.155" offset="1223973">And in the last paragraph, the Commission reserved jurisdiction to take further steps in the future as might be necessary and appropriate to give effects -- effect to that portion of its order.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.659" offset="1293981">The second Commission order which is involved in this case is the order of the Commission of September 1955 which denied the Louisiana State Commission's petition to reopen the 1953 order to which I have just called the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.902" offset="1386977">Now, the order in 1953 was the result of a series, a long series of hearings and proceedings under Section 11 commencing back in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.925" offset="1435042">Suffice that to say for the purpose of this case that in 1949, among other things, the Commission acting pursuant to Section 11 (b) (1) approved the creation of the Middle South Utilities, Inc., as a holding company and reserved jurisdiction with respect to Middle South for the purpose of making determinations in the future as to the retainability by Middle South and its subsidiaries and in this case, Louisiana Power, of certain non-electric properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.137" offset="1579969">Now, acting under the reservation in its order of 1949, in January 1953, the Commission, pursuant again to Section 11 (b) (1) and other sections of the Act, issued a notice -- an order to Middle South and Louisiana Power and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.234" offset="1664293">In connection with that notice appearing, I should like to call to the Court' attention page 83 of the record and towards the top of the page, paragraph Number 3, the specific -- one of the specific issues enumerated in that notice of hearing whether Middle South and Louisiana should be required to take action to dispose of the gas utility assets and non-utility assets of Louisiana, and if so, what terms and conditions should be imposed in connection therewith?</text>
            <text syncTime="429.616" offset="1821863">And I think it's rather important also to notice in connection with this order that in the last paragraph thereof, the secretary acting upon orders of the Commission is very careful to provide for a registered notice and registered mail service upon each of the Public Service Commissions involved including the respondent, Louisiana Public Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.279" offset="1932518">Now, in considering the facts of the case, one thing is absolutely certain and that is that the Louisiana Public Service Commission got notice of this hearing in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.547" offset="1981524">There is no question or no dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.481" offset="2001272">There is also no question about the fact that the hearing which was noticed, as I've just called to the Court's attention, for February 1953 was a full hearing, an evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.418" offset="2057070">The respondents, Louisiana Power and Middle South filed an answer which is found in full at page 84 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.753" offset="2098343">Evidence was adduced with opportunity for cross-examination.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="502.815" stopTime="506.503">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="502.815" offset="2114644">Was the Public Service Commission a party to that proceeding?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_g_meeker" startTime="506.503" stopTime="970.906">
            <label>Mr. Thomas G. Meeker</label>
            <text syncTime="506.503" offset="2129377">That the Public Service Commission received notice and was entitled to come in as a person or a party if it so desired pursuant to the rules of practice of the Commission and it was specifically given notice so that it would have that opportunity if it desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.515" offset="2205445">In addition to the fact that there was a direct and cross-examination, an opportunity for the same, there were arguments presented in support of Middle South's position and of Louisiana Power's position which in short was that Louisiana Power's gas properties ought to be permitted to be retained by Middle South and Louisiana as an additional integrated public utility system within the proviso to Section 11 (b) (1), known as Clause (a) to which I will refer later on in the course of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.400" offset="2349014">But it's perfectly clear that Louisiana failed to appear, that is the Louisiana State Commission, when it had the opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.955" offset="2379212">It's also interesting to note that no one asked for an extension, they were so concerned about these legal determinations as to which they know call -- raise as substantial issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.829" offset="2430725">No one asked for an extension, neither Middle South nor Louisiana Power.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.340" offset="2452773">Now, in March, the Commission issued its findings and opinion and order and they are found in the record, the opinion is found from pages 104 to 126 and the order is found at page 127.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.325" offset="2516720">In short, the Commission ordered that Middle South and Louisiana Power divest themselves of all of the non-electric assets of Louisiana Power.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.765" offset="2562382">And when I say non-electric assets, I'm referring to the gas properties and to one water property.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.222" offset="2592266">The reason that the Commission gave in its findings and opinion was that Middle South and Louisiana Power had failed to establish that separation of the gas assets held by Louisiana Power would result in the loss of substantial economies to that additional system.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.405" offset="2677008">And in talking about additional system, we are talking about the gas properties of Louisiana Power as required by Clause (a) of Section 11 (b) (1) so as to justify the retention of those gas assets along with the electric assets of the Middle South system.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.531" offset="2765511">Now, very few things happened from that point on until 1954 and the only things that did happen looked toward compliance with the Commission's 1953 order which was entered after a full hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.777" offset="2838444">Not only was there no petition for rehearing filed within five days as is provided by our rules of practice, but neither Middle South nor Louisiana Power sought to challenge the Commission's substantive determinations which are raised very definitely in the yellow brief, the brief of Louisiana Power &amp; Light Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.017" offset="2935411">No one challenged the substantive determinations within the 60-day period as is provided by statute under Section 24 (a) of the Act within which a petition for review might be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.685" offset="2994134">As I have suggested, every action gave an appearance of compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.750" offset="3014405">In fact as the record will demonstrate at pages 88 and 89, Middle South and Louisiana Power asked for additional time pursuant to Section 11 (e) of the Act within which to comply, to comply with the order of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.426" offset="3093086">And the Commission extended until March of 1955, the time within which the company's might come in and comply with the 1953 directive.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.815" offset="3138644">Now, on November 10th, 1954, they took another step.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.824" offset="3158706">Louisiana Power and Louisiana Gas Service Corporation, in short referred to as Louisiana Gas which is a newly organized and wholly owned subsidiary of Louisiana Power, filed an application-declaration with the Commission under the Act proposing among other things that the gas properties which the Middle South and Louisiana Power had been directed to dispose of be transferred along with the other non-electric properties to Louisiana Gas as a step looking forward -- looking toward compliance with the 1953 order.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.022" offset="3331427">Now, finally a year and nine months after the 1953 11 (b) order to which they had been working compliance with, Louisiana Commission sends a telegram, telegrams found in the record at page 89.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.574" offset="3445635">And the substance of the telegram and the subsequent petition and supplemental petition filed and found at the record from pages 90 to 92 was the Commission opened up the record in year 1953 proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.761" offset="3530376">We would like to come in and present some important additional evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.614" offset="3565798">For example, I call the Court's attention to the brief on behalf of Louisiana Public Service Commission and particularly to the paragraph on page -- the two paragraphs on page 51, the -- the second and third paragraphs in which the Commission has asked to consider new evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.738" offset="3682304">Now, the Commission asked for an offer of proof and at the request of the Louisiana Commission, extended the time for its filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.533" offset="3733504">The offer of proof was received.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.416" offset="3744998">It is found in the transcript of record, commencing on page 1 and at page 5 thereof in the offer of proof, the Louisiana Commission sets forth the general reasons on which it bases its request for reopening.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.403" offset="3848965">Briefs were submitted and oral argument was had.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.794" offset="3866520">And subsequently in September, the Commission came out with an opinion and order.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.243" offset="3900374">The opinion is found commencing at the record at 129 and the order at the record 133 and denied the petition for reopening on the ground that there was no basis for reopening the proceedings in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.281" offset="3976547">Now, in its opinion --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="970.906" offset="3986996">In the offer of proof, did they -- did they offer to introduce new testimony, new evidence?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_g_meeker" startTime="979.728" stopTime="1186.066">
            <label>Mr. Thomas G. Meeker</label>
            <text syncTime="979.728" offset="4022314">In the offer of proof, they offered to introduce evidence with respect to the operations of the companies in 1954, evidence as to the cost of those operations and the relative cost and perhaps losses which would occur if divestment were to be carried through and they had to comply but those were based in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.691" offset="4134118">And as we point out in our reply brief just filed today, the -- the figures which they offer in connection with their offer of proof are in effect new data.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.767" offset="4218441">They are based on new year's earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.127" offset="4227845">In fact in 1952, the Commission was considering figures which were before it on the basis of the operations in 1952.Here, they come in now two years later and they want to give new information or new data based on operations for the year-end in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.092" offset="4347695">Now, the Louisiana Commission filed its petition for review in the court below, requesting a review of the Commission's denial of its petition to reopen and also requesting a review of the Commission's order of March 1953, the divestment order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.664" offset="4430033">We filed a motion to dismiss, the petition on the ground that in essence it was an attempt to appeal from an order as to which the time for appeal had long since expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.630" offset="4485935">The court below found first that the Commission's order of 1955, denying the petition to reopen was reviewable and set it aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.932" offset="4535150">It held that the S.E.C., the Commission had in effect misinterpreted the -- in the 1953 proceeding Clause (a) of Section 11 (b) (1) in legal determinations made in that proceeding in connection with the retainability by Louisiana Power of its non-electric properties and it remanded the matter to us for consideration in light of own its construction of Clause (a) of Section 11 (b) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.504" offset="4665344">Now, we think the court below was wrong, both on the procedural point and the substantive issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.873" offset="4698885">The one thing I would like to say, Mr. Chief Justice, to you before proceeding to my argument is that I think upon examination of the offer of proof, the petition and the supplemental petition, the Court will readily see that there was no allegation in any of those documents of a change in conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.900" offset="4795016">And I think that as we will try to contend to demonstrate to the Court that is an important aspect of what has been referred to in this case as the procedural phase of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1216.436" offset="4969096">That is the most serious and shocking aspect of the case as far as we are concerned, Mr. Justice Whittaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.739" offset="5006294">Now, we contend first of all, may it please the Court, that the court below committed error in permitting this 1955 attack upon a final and binding 1953 directive of our Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.079" offset="5071705">In so doing, the Court relied on the last two sentences of Section 11 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.853" offset="5098768">And if the Court will indulge me once again, I should like to examine for the Court the last two sentences of 11 (b) because we think the court below was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.904" offset="5170970">Those sentences are found on page 50 of our brief, the appendix there to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.724" offset="5198242">Now, it is interesting to know in going through the legislative history of this particular part of 11 (b) that nobody seems to know how these last two sentences got into the Public Utility Holding Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.974" offset="5263235">There is no legislative history to guide us.We believe though that the reason for their inclusion becomes apparent on a sentence by sentence examination of those last two sentences of 11 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.763" offset="5330422">Taking the last sentence first, it reads, "Any order made under this subsection shall be subject to judicial review as provided in Section 24."</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.644" offset="5381935">Now, that merely repeats -- that merely repeats the provision for appeal as contained in Section 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.613" offset="5421850">And before I pass the legislative history, I would like to interrupt the train just a moment to point out as I neglected to do that the last two sentences were apparently added in the conference on the legislation and that may explain the reason why they're having been added at the last moment, there is no explanation in writing for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.823" offset="5518712">But the last sentences I have indicated merely indicates that -- that Section 24 is applicable in an 11 (b) situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.229" offset="5568240">Now, presumably an order under 11 (b) would be reviewable in the absence of this last sentence, of the last paragraph of 11 (b).I think this shows in effect that Congress was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.491" offset="5629367">They were concerned lest one of these most important orders and I believe the Louisiana Power Company has referred to an order under this Section as the death sentence for which they seek commutation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.369" offset="5688822">It is that type of important order that is involved here and it is an order of unusual nature in the sense that it looks toward future compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.867" offset="5742843">The legislative history indicates that there was some discussion about the fact that the actual compliance with this order comes much later and the history of the proceedings under Section 11 (b) confirmed the wisdom of that legislative prophecy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.272" offset="5820479">And I think also that the lawyers who were the draftsmen here were properly concerned perhaps that maybe in view of the fact that this type of 11 (b) order looked towards the future was in effect a directive to the systems to comply at some future date to come in with a plan which would comply with the standards of 11 (b), that there was a fear on the part of the lawyer-legislators that this might be attacked as an interlocutory order from which there was no appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.536" offset="5949524">And it was such an important order I think that Congress and we can at best speculate but I think it is logical so to do that Congress felt that there ought to be a specific right of appeal from this type of order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.310" offset="6016606">Now, looking at the first sentence, if I may refer now to that, the Commission may by order revoke or modify any order previously made under this subsection if after notice an opportunity for hearing it finds that the conditions upon which the order was predicated do not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.779" offset="6122454">Now, we believe that this language was inserted because Congress was concerned that perhaps an order would be issued under 11 (b) based upon a set of particular conditions existing at a particular time which looked forward to compliance at a later date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.054" offset="6211584">And that in the intervening period from the date of the 11 (b) order and the future time at which compliance might be affected, there could be a change of conditions and this being such an important order, there ought to be an opportunity for the parties to come in and to seek a modification or revocation thereof if the conditions had changed so that perhaps the order issued earlier was no longer appropriate for the new conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.222" offset="6336240">Now, it seems to us that the insertion of this provision for this purpose makes awfully good sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.700" offset="6390157">We don't believe that Congress had in mind as the Court suggest below that this language, this first sentence was to be used to come in for reopening almost at any time after a final order under 11 (b) had been entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.748" offset="6470405">We don't believe that the Congress have that in mind because we are also mindful that the first sentence of 11 (b) on page 49 of our brief says, "It shall be the duty of the Commission as soon as practicable after January 1, 1938."</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.545" offset="6565595">We think that the Congress had in mind that this Section ought to -- or that a compliance with this Section ought to be achieved as soon as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.445" offset="6617109">And such a determination or resolution it seems to us to be completely inconsistent with the concept that this first sentence opens the door for reopening such a long and protracted proceeding almost at any time at will as long as you make a allegation in effect that the record before the Commission was not complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.516" offset="6713448">And I think perhaps that it would be well to credit to the legislators, perhaps, this concern and that is that certainly without the specific statutory authorization given to the Commission, it's doubtful, extremely doubtful under existing precedence whether it would have had the power or would have the power to reconsider such an order particularly when that order had been before a court for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.591" offset="6845733">Thus, we think that these sentences have meanings which are contrary to the interpretations given to them by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.849" offset="6878751">As to the first sentence, the Commission has consistently interpreted to permit modification or revocation of 11 (b) orders only in the light of change in circumstances which had occurred since the original order under 11 (b) was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.508" offset="6957432">And we have collected at page 18 of our brief that those line of cases were Commission decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.644" offset="6985958">Now, as to the second sentence, the Commission contends that it means that 11 (b) orders are directly reviewable pursuant to Section 24 (a) of the Act which is found in the appendix to our brief, in which provides that a petition for review must be filed within 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.011" offset="7075401">Once 60 days has elapsed, it is the Commission's position -- if 60 days have gone by without the filing of a petition for review, we contend the order, the 11 (b) order is no longer subject to challenge by an attack upon the conditions found to have existed when the order was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.421" offset="7181040">Now, we believe also that the court below erred in holding -- in holding that Section 11 (b) authorizes the reopening of a concluded proceeding without a showing of change in circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.963" offset="7255228">Now, let's see what the Court did to reach this interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.538" offset="7277484">The Court construed the first sentence, which we have just reviewed, to permit a modification where it can be shown that the conditions on which the order was predicated were not truly the actual condition or in other words in the Court's own language found at the record 138 that modification might be based on the facts as they existed of the time of the order which is to be modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.247" offset="7400364">Now, this is -- interpretation in our opinion is nothing but an open invitation to anyone in an 11 (b) proceeding who thinks he might have made a better case at some later date to come along and file a petition for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.512" offset="7473403">And we think that if this Court agrees with us in our construction that it ought -- just plain reverse and go no further with any of the issues in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.959" offset="7515199">To put it in another way, if this decision below is allowed to stand, all someone has to do who has rights in such a proceeding is to make a mere allegation that data in the original record before our Commission is incomplete and this decision will open the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.455" offset="7609240">This type of reopening is rare indeed in the life of an administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.133" offset="7643930">It is even rarer when the court below requires the administrative agency to reconsider its decision made in another -- in an earlier proceeding as to which it has issued a final order back in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.238" offset="7712371">We say that this result reached by the court below could only be reached if the statutory language is so clear that it precludes any other interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.774" offset="7762422">And frankly, it is our position that the language of the first sentence doesn't compel any such construction as placed upon it by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.275" offset="7800456">It is contrary to the congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.051" offset="7815607">We believe that in putting in this sentence, the Congress was mindful of its own admission -- admonition in 11 (b) to obtain compliance as soon as practicable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2018.114" offset="8175783">Well, may I say this, Mr. Justice Brennan, that it seems to me from reviewing the cases they have pretty consistently held that as far as the petition for rehearing is concerned before an administrative agency, it is a matter wholly within the discretion of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.752" offset="8246418">I understand that there was a case many years ago involving the I.C.C. which held to the contrary, the Atchison case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.471" offset="8277243">But subsequently, in I.C.C. versus Jersey City, this Court very clearly restricted the decision in that case to the facts of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.032" offset="8319457">And in direct answer to your question, I would say we contend that a petition for rehearing is wholly in the discretion of the administrative agency, although I would not eliminate the possibility of an extreme situation where the agency acted manifestly with arbitrariness in complete disregard of some patent fact that it ought to construe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.148" offset="8431992">As I was about to say if this Court agrees with the Commission's interpretation of the first sentence, we submit that that's as far as this Honorable Court need to go and it should promptly reverse the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.036" offset="8499493">Now, the interpretation by the court below of the second sentence is in our opinion clearly inconsistent with the review provisions of Section 24 (a) and the prevailing precedence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.766" offset="8558425">Again, may I call your attention to the second sentence, "Any order made under this subsection shall be subject to judicial review as provided in Section 24."</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.465" offset="8641181">Now, what did the Court hold below with respect to this sentence?</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.545" offset="8657586">It held first of all that it could review an S.E.C. order denying a petition to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.274" offset="8692485">In the second instance, it held that it could require this Commission to consider matters which could have been but which were not presented in the full hearing in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.253" offset="8740342">And thirdly, it held that it could review at the same time legal determinations made by our Commission in connection with the 1953 proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.366" offset="8788825">Now, this interpretation runs completely counter to the prevailing general rule that in the interest of the end of litigation, a failure to file a timely petition for review jurisdictionally precludes appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.484" offset="8865311">As I have suggested earlier, the acceptance of this decision below in our view creates a real absurdity, to wit by filing a petition for rehearing, the Louisiana Commission can now obtain a full review in the Court of Appeals of the order denying the petition for reopening as well as the 1953 order, whereas if the same Commission had filed a petition for review on the same date in an appropriate Court of Appeals, it would have to be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.438" offset="8997073">Now, even assuming for the sake of argument that the denial of an application for modification is appealable, we believe the Court's interpretation of the last sentence was an error, both as to the availability of judicial review and the scope of judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.617" offset="9093831">Admittedly, orders under Section 11 (b) which actually revoke or modify previous orders are reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.490" offset="9133328">That we concede.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.369" offset="9140851">But the last sentence of 11 (b) is interpreted by the court below as making the denial of a request to reopen expressly reviewable, while the words "any order under this subsection" as are used therein are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.477" offset="9221308">We submit the only orders mentioned in this Section are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.095" offset="9243773">First, orders directing that certain action be taken either integration or simplification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.671" offset="9274075">And second, that orders revoking or modifying such original orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.454" offset="9301138">There's absolutely no mentioned in this Section of orders denying a petition for reopening.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.575" offset="9329664">Certainly, action taken by the Commission which takes the form of an order and which is not required by the Act to be affected by order is not normally reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.874" offset="9386820">For example, it has been held in a Court of Appeals decision, Eastern Utilities Associates versus S.E.C. in 162 F.2d, that an order of the Commission setting 11 (b) proceeding down for a hearing is not reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.454" offset="9461217">Now, even assuming once again that under certain circumstances there may be a review of an order denying revocation or modification after hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.544" offset="9509595">We contend that such a review would nevertheless be unavailable under this second sentence from the denial of a petition to reopen without hearing to the extent that the petition is based on facts which existed at the time of the original order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.481" offset="9593292">Thus, even if the first sentence were construed to authorize the Commission, the S.E.C. to revoke or modify a prior order upon a finding as the court below suggest that conditions upon which it was predicated did not truly exist at the time of the entry of the original 11 (b) order, it does not follow that such denial would be reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.579" offset="9709693">It's no different in our view from any other petition for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.592" offset="9729755">There seems to be no reason in our opinion why the denial of such petition in essence only a petition for rehearing should be anymore subject to review than the denial of any other petition for rehearing, the normal basis for which that some falls in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.133" offset="9807914">It is fairly well set of law the denial of the petition for rehearing is wholly discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.510" offset="9837380">Certainly, it is clear in the law that a party, after the time for appeal has expired, may not reinvest himself with the right of appeal by filing a petition for rehearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2676.833" offset="10810702">As I have indicated to the Court, we consider this no different from any other petition for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.339" offset="10848737">And as we believe it, well established in the law, there seems to be no reason why this is not a matter completely within the discretion of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.302" offset="10892622">Now, at page 138 of the record in its decision, the court below said, "Its review was not circumscribed by the rules applying to review of discretionary acts."</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.478" offset="10949256">Now, we contend that that is error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.282" offset="10960541">We contend that the last sentence of 11 (b) provides only that the Commission may revoke or modify its previous order whereas other provisions of Section 11 (b) used mandatory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.007" offset="11023444">For example, on page 50, right above the last two sentences, the Court will note that the statute employs the use of the word "shall".</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.706" offset="11062209">It is our contention that this discretionary nature of the pertinent phrases dictates the judicial review if any should be eliminated to considerations of abuses of discretions and certainly none can be shown here, all one has to do is to examine the Commission's opinion and to examine the offer of proof which did not allege or indicate that the original factual in conclusions were incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.791" offset="11182582">The abuse of discretion is not shown here and we feel that the Court went far beyond the permissible scope of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.764" offset="11218422">Now, in the few moments that I have left here, I would like to call the Court's attention in fact that there are substantive issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.999" offset="11255411">It's our position that you don't -- that Your Honors do not have to reach those questions here, that there is -- in the procedural aspects of this case a sufficient basis for prompt reversal of the decision of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.280" offset="11316537">But I would like to mention in a very brief outline just what the substantive issues are and it maybe that I will not get to our position on them and perhaps until my rebuttal time and I hope the Court will indulge me if that would be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.003" offset="11383411">Calling the substantive issues which have been decided by the Commission in its 1953 proceeding and reviewed by the court below involved interpretations of what is referred to as Clause (a) of Section 11 (b) (1) found on page 49 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.085" offset="11487692">And if the Court would read from the italicized language beginning, "Provided however that the Commission shall permit a registered holding company to continue to control one or more additional integrated public utility systems, if, after notice and opportunity for hearing, it finds that A," and this is Clause (a), "Each of such additional systems cannot be operated as an independent system without the loss for substantial economies," and those are crucial words, "which can be secured by the retention of control by such holding company of such system."</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.662" offset="11666056">Now, we take the position that the Court was in error in interpreting this particular clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.962" offset="11695208">Section 11 (b) (1) of the Act requires that the operations of each registered holding company system be limited to a single integrated public utility system and to certain incidental businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.690" offset="11750170">Now, this proviso to 11 (b) (1), Clause (a), which I have just read, permits retention of one or more additional systems as an exception to the integration requirements if it can be shown that such retention meets the exacting requirements set forth not only in Clause (a) but in Clause (b) and (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.792" offset="11842539">Now, these substantive issues revolve around the words loss of substantial economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.094" offset="11875767">Now, first in construing Clause (a), the question is, should those words apply to the principal system, Middle South electric properties or only to the additional system, Louisiana gases properties -- gas property?</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.365" offset="11960822">And second, the question is, what is meant by the words loss of substantial economy?</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.326" offset="11988720">Those two questions are at issue if the Court has to reach these substantive matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.973" offset="12011290">Now, we contend that the words loss of substantial economies refers only to the potential loss which would be incurred by the additional system, the gas properties, if it were free from the single integrated electric utility system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.237" offset="12096345">And second, we contend that loss of substantial economy means that the free utility system, the gas properties, could not stand on its own feet and operate economically if it were independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.952" offset="12159143">To wit, we contend that Congress and we contend also and can demonstrate we believe that the legislative history supports us in this position that Congress expected, if there were to be such an additional system, that it would be able to stand on its own feet and capable of managing its own affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.717" offset="12250258">Unlike the last two sentences of Section -- of 11 (b) which we have discussed at length here, the legislative history here makes it clear that the draftsman intended the phrase to be interpreted as it has been interpreted consistently by the Commission.And may I again ask the Court's indulgence and suggest reference to our brief at page 40.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.303" offset="12372616">But I think that at that point I will reserve my further remarks on the substantive issues until my rebuttal time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3103.678" offset="12518066">And I would like to sketch briefly what that Commission is before I get into the basic question of what type of allegations did we make in order to seek a revocation or modification of an S.E.C. order in a petition to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.250" offset="12600404">First of all, the Louisiana Commission is the official public utility regulatory body of that State.</text>

            <text syncTime="3136.226" offset="12648260">It has all necessary power and authority to regulate public utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.612" offset="12673860">It is composed of three elected members who are elected from geographical districts of the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.350" offset="12704789">One of the Commissioners resides in the northern portion of the State in Monroe, Louisiana, another in central portion in Baton Rouge, the other in New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.432" offset="12741151">They are elected for six-year overlapping terms and they have the duty of fixing fair rates of returns for public utilities and establishing the rates that are to be paid by consumers and that is by the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.057" offset="12815548">The Louisiana Commission's obligation and duty is therefore parallel with that of the S.E.C. It's an obligation to the public and a particular one that the consumers in this case of the services of Louisiana power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.068" offset="12887646">The S.E.C. in interpreting the Public Utility Holding Company Act feels that the divestiture of the gas properties of Louisiana Power would be proper under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.696" offset="12930173">The Louisiana Commission feels that it would not because it offered to prove in its offer of proof that there would be a loss of substantial economies, to wit nearly a million dollars a year which would have to be paid if these two systems were separated.</text>

            <text syncTime="3733.761" offset="15038464">For example in Section 8, whenever a state law requires approval of the ownership by a single company of utility assets of both in electric and gas system, the S.E.C. won't give you an order permitting that acquisition without first having approval from the state regulatory commission itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.980" offset="15115264">Section 9 of the Act prohibits a registered holding company without S.E.C. approval from acquiring securities or utility assets.</text>

            <text syncTime="3873.296" offset="15596544">That the S.E.C. invited our participation at least to the extent of an offer of proof that we submitted this offer of proof and then our right to take this matter to court and ask for a judicial review is expressly provided in the statute itself, expressly provided in Section 11 (b) of the entire 33 sections of the Public Utility Holding Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3898.246" offset="15696332">It is only in Section 11 (b) that the right of judicial review is expressly repeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.594" offset="15721723">As counsel said, "It need not have been placed in the Act because under Section 24 (a) you may appeal any order.</text>

            <text syncTime="3936.626" offset="15849827">So that to me, it leaves no doubt that we have the right of judicial review and the lower court and Judge Tuttle so held that -- I see my time is up --</text>
