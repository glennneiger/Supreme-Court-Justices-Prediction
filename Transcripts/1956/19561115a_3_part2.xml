            <text syncTime="20.080" offset="183672">I had just made the point that if the issue is whether du Pont's products are capable on their merits of gaining a position in the market, independent of influence or control or some stock relationship, then the fact that it sold the same kind of paints to other people that it sold to General Motors in a percentage relationship of 80:20 instead of the other way around as it is in the case of the sales to automobile manufacturers was quite significant.</text>

            <text syncTime="197.840" offset="894725">They take all sales of paint to automobile companies for original application to the bodies and to automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.376" offset="936835">And that for example -- that figure if I may -- without confusing you, for example, that figure as to General Motors would not include any paint sold to General Motors for refrigerators or house paint or for painting industrial objects that didn't work directly related to the automobile.</text>

            <text syncTime="379.250" offset="1620407">Well, that's what I'm going to talk about now, Mr. Justice Black, and I would like to say at the beginning that so far as that argument is intended to suggest that the sales of the paint to automobile field manufacturers, that particular kind of paint can't make their way on their merits that these sales which we make of the same paint for the same purposes to other people provide a basis for a contrary inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.444" offset="1745168">Let me illustrate what I mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.350" offset="1752795">They say General Motors buy too much Duco and there's something strange about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.838" offset="1774738">Well, now, the fact is that 75% of the Class 1 railroads in this country specify that Duco must be used on the outside of all passenger cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.202" offset="1828133">They also specify that it must be used on locomotives.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.941" offset="1847150">For that reason, we sell about 75% of the requirements of the electromotive division of General Motors because the railroads tell them they want the Duco used on the locomotives.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.326" offset="1884662">Now, that figure, I hope I've made clear those sales are not included in this 80%, 90% figure because they are not sales to automobile manufacturers.</text>

            <text syncTime="480.172" offset="2024051">Could you, without too much trouble, tell us the percentage of sales of the other commodities included in those 18 with General Motors as compared with other buyers.</text>

            <text syncTime="498.175" offset="2096044">Yes, I think I understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.888" offset="2102941">The record unfortunately is not entirely clear on that but the next largest paint item for example is $3 million of Dulux that is sold to General Motors to put on Frigidaire, iceboxes, cleaners, washers, dryers and things of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.047" offset="2179532">Now, the record doesn't show an exact percentage of the sales to other people, but it shows that du Pont supplies practically 100% of the requirements of Westinghouse, General Electric and Crosley for that kind of paint.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.141" offset="2251943">So, I think it maybe assumed in view of their position in the refrigerator business that those sales are substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.988" offset="2283290">Now, in fabrics, you do get a situation somewhat like the paint situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.315" offset="2308681">The fabrics -- the great percentage of the fabrics sold to automobile manufacturers for use in the original construction of automobiles is sold by du Pont to General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.837" offset="2358732">Now, they do sell a very substantial amount of fabric to other people who use it for the same purpose that General Motors does.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.236" offset="2392273">For example, people -- much of this is used for upholstery in trucks and things of that kind where you need something heavier than the cloth fabric.</text>

            <text syncTime="649.019" offset="2699473">That's right and I'm -- I'm going to speak about that, Mr. Justice Reed, if I can in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.793" offset="2726536">In fact, I shall do now -- do so now.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.337" offset="2744717">And I'd like to begin by saying that of course as I take it, the court realizes that what we are concerned here is that it's a problem of why General Motors buy so much as compared with other people who don't buy as much.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.991" offset="2815352">So, what we are inquiring into are the reasons really why the purchases are greater on the one side than on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.729" offset="2866239">The Government says the reason is stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.518" offset="2877419">Now, for that inference just as a matter of logic to have any force, I think you have to know something about the reasons why the other people don't buy more from -- from du Pont and that's what I'm about to tell you.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.598" offset="2929768">Of course, if they didn't buy, if there was any evidence that they didn't buy because of some doubts about the quality or the price or the service of du Pont's product, I think the Government would have a -- have a basis for its inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.564" offset="2985671">I'm not prepared to say that even then, that inference would overcome the affirmative testimony we have from these people who buy the paint about why they buy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.771" offset="3022451">But now, let me speak about the reasons why Ford and Chrysler don't buy more from du Pont and that's really what it comes down to because those two companies together with General Motors account for by far the greater part of the -- of the automobile production in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.742" offset="3094340">Now, each of them is a little different, but I think each of them to the facts, in some of these facts, not all of them, but some of them are in the uncontested findings of the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.679" offset="3134046">He didn't cover all of them, but he covered some of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.150" offset="3143973">I think those facts are inconsistent with the Government's inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.427" offset="3157034">Let's take the case of Ford first.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.529" offset="3169468">Ford for many years before 1939, always bought a substantial amount of paint from du Pont, automotive paint to put on automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.444" offset="3217115">But Ford long ago, under the guidance of Mr. Henry Ford Sr. embarked on a policy, not only as to paint and fabrics but as to a lot of other things, of making a major part of its own products.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.429" offset="3273122">So, they started making their own paint and their own fabric.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.091" offset="3287751">Now, just stopping there, let me observe.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.531" offset="3297468">It doesn't seem to me that the fact that Ford decided for reasons of its own to make these things instead of to buy them in the market proves very much about why General Motors buy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.185" offset="3344071">But there's a little more I can say about Ford.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.576" offset="3353684">The significant thing about Ford is what it does when it goes into the open market and buys the things that it doesn't make.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.105" offset="3383777">Now, throughout -- most to the period of time covered by this record, when it went into the open market and bought, it bought in large quantities from du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.399" offset="3424946">In fact, there was a long period in the late 1920s and 1930s, when it bought from du Pont all of the alkyd resin finish which it used on the outside of cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.741" offset="3474369">That's the automotive paint that we've been talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.551" offset="3485550">It bought all of that from du Pont that it didn't make.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.001" offset="3503417">Our time came about 1938 or 1939 when Mr. Henry Ford Sr. decided one day that he wouldn't buy anything more from du Pont, anything and instructions came down to stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.538" offset="3561514">When Henry Ford II took over the company after the war, the purchases resumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.548" offset="3589517">And today, the extent that they don't buy or don't make their own paint, they buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.186" offset="3616162">The record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.131" offset="3619924">It doesn't show the exact amounts, but they buy substantial quantities of paint from du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.225" offset="3640299">Their purchases are included in the $3.5 million worth of paint sold to other automobile manufacturers that I told the Court about.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.924" offset="3675094">Now, the story -- and I'll stop there again and I -- I'd submit that on that basis, even the inference which the Government tries to draw isn't justified in the case of Ford.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.402" offset="3716995">I don't even come to the question of whether the inference is enough to overcome the affirmative testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.560" offset="3737579">Now, Chrysler has a different story.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.382" offset="3748864">Chrysler, during the 1920s and the 1930s, early 1930s also bought a substantial amount of paint from du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.886" offset="3782928">I couldn't get the figures for those remote periods but there is no dispute it did buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.462" offset="3801213">I think there's an uncontested finding on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.162" offset="3816051">Then a time came, I think it was about 1937, when Chrysler adopted a different policy and there's uncontested testimony at least on this, I'm not clear at the moment whether it's in the findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.114" offset="3863803">The man who would -- the du Pont Company who'd been dealing with them came to see them and I think it was Mr. Keller.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.767" offset="3890448">Chrysler said, “We have adopted a new policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.961" offset="3903195">We have decided that we're going to buy the greater part of our paint, if not all of it, from some company who doesn't really sell paint to anybody but us.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.615" offset="3941857">We want to have one company that really depends on us for its business.”</text>
            <text syncTime="964.408" offset="3960978">And the salesman said, “Well, this is a great blow to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.916" offset="3971009">Is there anything wrong with our paint?</text>
            <text syncTime="969.347" offset="3980727">Is there anything wrong with our service?</text>
            <text syncTime="971.146" offset="3987937">Have we done anything wrong?"</text>
            <text syncTime="972.275" offset="3992430">And Mr. Keller said, “No, your product and your service have always been highly satisfactory, but we have just decided that we were going to have one company that -- who would be our principal supplier and who will look to us for the major part of its sales.”</text>
            <text syncTime="989.736" offset="4062333">Now, I'm sure it will immediately occur to the Court that what that incident indicates is that this so-called disproportionate percentage can occur in a very normal business relationship without any influence of stock or anything else.</text>

            <text syncTime="1075.015" offset="4403388">And their documents also indicate that Chrysler buys by far the major part of its requirements from Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.771" offset="4434422">Just as bearing on this so-called disproportionate percentage, I should like to give the Court one more example which I think is -- is -- makes my point too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.865" offset="4470784">One of the companies that sells paint in pretty substantial quantities to General Motors is a company called Rinshed-Mason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.883" offset="4498892">It sells topcoats for automobiles to some of these divisions that won't buy it from -- from du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.656" offset="4525955">Now, there are exhibits in the records, I think it takes about four exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.968" offset="4543195">Unfortunately, we didn't get this in our brief, but there are exhibits in the record from which you can compute Rinshed-Mason's total automotive sales and established a relationship between those sales and its sales to du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.678" offset="4606098">And it appears that in the case of that company, it sells upwards of 90% of its paint on this same basis to du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.050" offset="4639535">No suggestion I suppose by anyone that General Motors buys from Rinshed-Mason on some favored or noncompetitive position.</text>

            <text syncTime="1678.896" offset="6818983">That was a very serious mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.183" offset="6848136">The other argument that the Government makes which is its only suggestion here in support of its attack on the affirmative evidence that these purchases are made independently has to do with Fisher Body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.556" offset="6913546">And I should like to some -- say something very briefly about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.306" offset="6936639">They, as Mr. Davis outlined it to you this morning, take the position that for many years, Fisher Body was operated within General Motors with a considerable degree of independence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.516" offset="6985435">And Mr. -- the Government attributes that to the character and personality of the Fisher brothers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.174" offset="7020022">That is a point of view which we embrace and it's a principle we would like -- and we apply it more widely in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.027" offset="7051473">There, General Motors had complete voting control of Fisher brothers and yet the Government itself recognizes that this question of control as is proved depends on the people that were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.690" offset="7102151">Now, the Government says that there was a long period of time when they were independent and that while they were independent, they didn't buy anything and not very much from du Pont or at least not as much as the other division did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.799" offset="7154604">And then a time came when the -- a loss to independence, they now say that was when the Fishers retired about 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.297" offset="7188564">And then, the Government says there was a change in the pattern with purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.610" offset="7209775">Now, each step really in that argument, except for the concession that the Fisher brothers were independent, it seems to us to be incorrect and not supported by -- by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.988" offset="7255333">In the first place, it isn't true that before 1944, Fisher didn't buy very much from du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.969" offset="7287202">As the table and their statistics in the record which indicate when you put them together that in a 10-year period, between about 1927 to I think the end of 1936, in every year, Fisher bought more from -- from du Pont than all of the other divisions of General Motors combined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.239" offset="7364315">The second thing that's wrong with it is that there never was any change in the -- so far as Fisher's independence is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.112" offset="7403813">And there is an uncontested finding by the trial court to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.513" offset="7425442">Trial court found that Fisher at all times exercised freedom in making its own purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.662" offset="7454072">The Government seems to read that finding is confined to some period before 1944, but that's not what the finding says, and it's accompanied by a finding in which the Court -- further finding in which the Court says, “The evidence requires me to reject the charge that Fisher is -- is a captive market for du Pont.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.924" offset="7535052">So that their attempt -- and let me add this that those findings are fully supported by the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.763" offset="7558457">The evidence shows that after 1944, Fisher bought from du Pont in just the same way that it did before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.998" offset="7591372">The only suggestion that the Government ever made in its briefs that has any difference was a -- an erroneous figure which it produced, which said that in 1947 and 1948, Fisher was buying I think 65% or 70% of its fabrics from du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.879" offset="7658872">Well, the trial court again made an uncontested finding that in 1947 on, Fisher bought between 37% and 45% of its fabrics from du Pont and there is evidence in the record that shows that those percentages don't differ significantly from the percentages before 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.817" offset="7730657">So, that the Fisher argument really gives them no part at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.862" offset="7754794">Now, with this -- this affirmative evidence in the record, there's been no preference or favoritism.</text>

            <text syncTime="1928.087" offset="7815711">I just want to say this that this -- this evidence about how the divisions have bought that they haven't bought from du Pont when they didn't want to, but when they did buy, they had a good business reason for buying, It has driven the Government to -- to take a position which I think deserve some comment, particularly in view of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.693" offset="7898154">On page 20 of their reply brief, they now redefine the strength in somewhat different terms than they've ever said defined it before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.078" offset="7939636">And I -- that I think makes it necessary for me to say a word about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.295" offset="7960534">We didn't really deal with this -- it might have been our main brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.303" offset="7980596">They say in the middle of page 20, "We only argue that where a du Pont product was competitive for the products to other manufacturers or where du Pont was on a competitive basis as capable of performing some service as any other company, then the du Pont-General Motors relationship took the place of competition to determine the flow of trade."</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.624" offset="8085817">That statement is interesting for one reason at least because it -- it seems on any basis to concede that this -- even on their terms, taking their full statement of the case, this relationship did not immunize du Pont from the -- from the competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.777" offset="8158438">It didn't have any kind of absolute control over price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.236" offset="8172335">It didn't have any power to exclude competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.308" offset="8184560">But that's not -- I'm not interested in arguing the law, part of it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.293" offset="8200547">What I should like to say is this, that if that statement means anything, it seems to me in something like this that if everything was about equal or if there was any reason to do otherwise, then perhaps du Pont in some cases and to some extent got some kind of a preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.388" offset="8272959">Now, even when you state their case in that vague and attenuated way, the evidence in the record won't support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.001" offset="8315382">And I -- I should like just to -- I can only do this by example and I can't give you the flavor of the record, but here are some examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.416" offset="8349027">In 1920, Chevrolet was using some fabrics for a panel board in a car.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.599" offset="8373791">Du Pont came along and said, “We can -- we can make a better panel board from -- than that and we can -- we can do it and sell it to you to a price half what you're paying,” and Chevrolet said "All right."</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.647" offset="8417991">And they did it and they sold it to them at half the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.016" offset="8427395">They had the business for a year I think or two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.887" offset="8438888">And then, a competitor came along and got hold of one of these things and of course he was able to imitate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.020" offset="8459473">The man who had been supplying Chevrolet before and he came back and said, "Give me back the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.570" offset="8477654">I'll do it for you with the same price du Pont does," and he got the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.501" offset="8497403">Now, there was something that du Pont made and reduced the price and let them have the business for a year and then they took it for some reason of their own, perfectly proper and gave it back to them but it certainly indicate there wasn't any preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.558" offset="8545573">Now, here's another example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.385" offset="8556962">One of the important commodities in the fabric still involved in this case is something called 'teal' which is -- used to be used for tops of your closed cars and it's also used for the tops of convertibles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.812" offset="8602624">Fisher was buying teal from du Pont and from somebody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.665" offset="8617984">I think about half and half on 1931 and it said to these two suppliers, "We want you to guarantee that this fabric you're selling us will not fade, shrink from cleaning for a period of two years."</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.951" offset="8675140">And the competitor said, "All right, we'll give you the guarantee," but du Pont took the two fabrics off its own -- its competitors and it tested them and it found that they wouldn't, either one of them really stand up to two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.762" offset="8718399">And it came back and said, "We don't think we can really properly give you that guarantee," and the other fellow got the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.863" offset="8746820">Du Pont worked on the fabric for two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.660" offset="8758000">It developed the fabric that it could give a guarantee for it and it came back and said, "Now, we -- we'll give you the guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.007" offset="8783391">We've got a fabric."</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.098" offset="8787780">Fisher says, "No, we're not interested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.625" offset="8793840">We're going to keep on giving all of these orders to this other man," and they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.732" offset="8818291">Now, those -- those examples can be duplicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.637" offset="8829889">We -- du Pont has tried to sell seat fabrics to General Motors Truck and Coach Division and the -- the record shows that they're as just good as the one they get to some place else, but they won't buy them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.106" offset="8871790">They say, “We're not interested in changing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.869" offset="8882866">I recall one exhibit here on the anodes that I spoke to the Chief Justice about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.630" offset="8901883">They've been -- a salesman is going around trying to sell anode.</text>

            <text syncTime="2204.199" offset="8920168">He went to Cadillac and he said, "Won't you buy our -- our anodes?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.400" offset="8936991">And the Cadillac engineer said, "Well, I have ordered some of them and I'm going to find out whether they are any different from the ones I've been buying from the Revere Copper Company and if they aren't any different, I'm going to continue to buy Revere's."</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.510" offset="8993416">Now, there's just no basis in this record in saying that the du Pont got a preference even when you -- their products were competitive or nearly equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.016" offset="9031450">These decisions were made in these separate divisions in the ordinary way, probably the only way they could be made, an enterprise of this size on ordinary -- on an ordinary business basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.430" offset="9077112">There's a -- a fascinating story in its record about a man trying to sell plastics to the General Motors divisions to be used in making steering wheels and he -- he never won -- here, he got a quarter of the business but he couldn't -- he couldn't -- never could get anymore and he lost that and he finally went to Pontiac where they were -- they were being fabricated in one divisions and he -- used by Pontiac and he went to Pontiac and there was a contemporaneous document on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.270" offset="9176482">It said, "Please, can't you give me some help on getting this plastics business?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.708" offset="9194245">And the man from Pontiac, and this is in the document, said "I don't give a damn whether you use your plastic or the plastic of one of your competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.371" offset="9220890">You go back and see the -- the other fellow," and he never got -- he never got his orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.976" offset="9239280">If you look at this record and I -- I -- it's hard to convey what it means, but if you look at it in terms of the ordinary days that they conduct the business, examine the testimony and look at these documents and show how this -- this enterprise was carried on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.528" offset="9313468">It's not a question of this finding being clearly wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="2582.769" offset="10434435">And the difficulty I think that the Government has is it cannot rid its mind of the natural preconception that somebody might have approached this case without knowing the facts in finding out what really happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="2608.220" offset="10536208">The Government makes two points about lead and I want to deal with both of them if I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.929" offset="10567137">One of them is that the fact that du Pont was chosen to manufacture tetraethyl lead shows that there was a -- that there was a tend -- some preferences given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.265" offset="10620426">Mr. Kettering testified without any qualification that he was the man who decided to call in du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.937" offset="10655117">Now, stopping right there, there are some contemporaneous documents that corroborate this testimony that he was the man who decided it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.302" offset="10684583">He also testified that the reason he did it was because he'd been talking to du Pont's for -- off and on for years about some of the chemical problems involved in tetraethyl lead, but he respected their capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.264" offset="10740381">And there is some contemporaneous documents that corroborate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.008" offset="10763368">He testified explicitly that the decision to call a man as far as he was concerned was not influenced in any degree by the stock relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.811" offset="10798582">Now, there isn't any document to contradict that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.802" offset="10810598">There isn't any evidence to contradict that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.967" offset="10819271">The judge made a finding on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.380" offset="10828884">It seems to me that finding can only be rejected if we are to decide that Mr. Kettering is unworthy of belief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2696.744" offset="10890324">He didn't know anyone else who was as good and he thought they were the ones to do it.Now again, nothing that impeaches or contradicts that testimony, no document.</text>

            <text syncTime="2710.809" offset="10946644">There aren't any -- there's not a choice, a question of a choice between -- between conflicting documents and conflicting testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.695" offset="10986141">So, there -- those are the facts about how that decision was made and why it was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.171" offset="11008084">Now, Mr. Justice Frankfurter this morning said a very interesting thing which I would like to comment on the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.200" offset="11032221">Let me say this.We should remember what the chemical industry in this country was in 1922.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.329" offset="11048730">We really didn't have any of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.036" offset="11055522">It's a development after the First World War.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.247" offset="11068374">The Government has never suggested in this case even by way of conjecture, the name of a company who would have been better qualified or equally qualified or even the name of any company who would have been interested in doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.340" offset="11116753">They had Mr. Kettering and Mr. Sloan there and they cross-examined them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.493" offset="11129396">They didn't ask them about any companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.942" offset="11139114">It was -- if there had been no stock relationship, if you consider the experience that du Pont had had in making explosives and particularly if you consider the subsequent efforts that they did make to get other chemical companies to do this, the choice is -- is perfectly reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.289" offset="11204524">And certainly, there is no basis for rejecting the findings in the absence of some kind of testimony that Mr. Kettering and Mr. Sloan testified a falsehood.</text>

            <text syncTime="2976.312" offset="12008573">It made quite a lot of money out of it, Mr. Justice Reed, but our position here is that it was perfectly proper arrangement made for the reasons that Mr. Kettering and Mr. Sloan said.</text>

            <text syncTime="2990.766" offset="12066461">They wanted a chemical company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.054" offset="12071581">They wanted somebody who had experience in handling dangerous commodities and they chose du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.603" offset="12093733">Now, by-and-by they made arrangements with Standard to manufacture and they let Standard start out with the same size plant that du Pont started out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.450" offset="12133125">And their original choice of -- of -- du Pont was fully justified because Standard unwisely used a process or method of manufacturing rather.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.569" offset="12169697">Not a process but a method of manufacturing that du Pont saw and said to them, “You'd better not do this.</text>

            <text syncTime="3038.971" offset="12259244">Now, it's quite true what Mr. Davis says that there were people killed in the -- in the du Pont plants but the significant thing about that disaster is that -- that it -- it was a thing that -- that kept the Jersey Company thereafter for manufacturing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.026" offset="12319431">It's also significant that du Pont never did anything in the same kind the Jersey Company did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.442" offset="12337089">No two accidents in the du Pont plants ever happened for the same reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="3199.610" offset="12901857">And if that -- if that fact overcomes the testimony of Mr. Kettering and Mr. Sloan about why this thing was done, they were the people who really made the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.270" offset="12940413">There is no suggestion that Mr. P.S.du Pont really had any active part in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.783" offset="12958490">It's that formal fact that he signed the contract, overcomes that testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="3220.074" offset="12983672">But again, I think if you read the testimony and look at the document and consider that -- that formal of that act, it becomes clear that there wasn't any -- there wasn't really any lack of arms-length duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.595" offset="13037798">There are other documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.871" offset="13042813">I must say this, Mr. Chief Justice Warren, in this record which shows that Mr. P.S. du Pont was highly scrupulous when he was president of General Motors in dealing with these intercorporate relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.265" offset="13092446">And there is either -- even documents written to him by the people in this one document, I remember in the du Pont Company, which shows the consciousness of the fact that they couldn't expect him to do anything for them while he was president of General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.776" offset="13146467">Those are not contrived after -- as they were written 25 years ago and I think genuine expressions of the attitude of which these men were in discharging their responsibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="3274.929" offset="13203101">I can understand why Mr. Davis would think it's -- it's clear but of course things of that kind is sometimes done in business here or inference were made on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.251" offset="13236328">And certainly in this case record, I think you loose any doubt that it might be clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.202" offset="13260152">It is not impossible for me in the time that I have because I want to reserve time for Mr. Sloan to deal as fully with the question of intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3307.186" offset="13332146">I do want to say this that there are -- those -- there are two letters in this record and only two letters in which a man in du Pont, writing to somebody in General Motors, referred to the stock as a means -- in connection with a sales effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.155" offset="13404035">Those are the two letters that Mr. Davis mentioned that Lammot du Pont wrote to the Fisher brothers back in 1922 or 1923.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.587" offset="13441755">Now, there are some letters inside General Motors referring to the stock and I think there's one -- one or two letters inside du Pont intra-company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.821" offset="13482611">But those two letters from Lammot du Pont are the only two letters at the time in the record, 34 years and I invite the Court to read those letters because I think they don't really bare the -- quite the construction which the Government puts on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.544" offset="13545514">It's truly mentioned to stop but hardly enough he mentioned it when he made much of it in this kind of a context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.187" offset="13568084">He said, “You really ought to buy from us.</text>

            <text syncTime="3514.437" offset="14161168">Now, in that letter, it was quoted two or three times I think in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.873" offset="14174856">Mr. Pratt said in effect, “Du Pont came to the rescue of General Motors in 1920, and they prevented this company from going into receivership,” which is true by the way.</text>

            <text syncTime="3540.626" offset="14265866">That's the letter, and Mr. Davis says it's like an iceberg and it is like an iceberg in that one respect that there's a great deal beneath it that I'd like to tell you about because I -- I think it illustrates the danger of dealing in this case in fair fragments which is -- I think the tendency the Government have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.736" offset="14334307">Here is what happened in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.809" offset="14342562">Delco was buying a varnish from a competitor of du Pont's and it was spraying all around on some appliances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.000" offset="14371401">It changed its method of operation and had the dip in this product it was getting from the competitors, it didn't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.568" offset="14405674">So, they -- they heard that Chevrolet was doing some dipping and they said to Chevrolet, “Where do you get your paint?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.226" offset="14428244">Said du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.700" offset="14434200">They asked du Pont if it could develop a paint and said it could and it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.960" offset="14447261">It developed a paint that would dip.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.669" offset="14458023">And Delco gave them an order for one carload, and before they could deliver the carload, they got a telephone call or wire from Delco saying, “Don't deliver it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.095" offset="14495744">We have decided we'll give our old supplier a chance to do this, get this business anyway.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.576" offset="14525628">And then Mr. Elms who was an old personal friend of Mr. Pratt has told he had been treated unfairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.497" offset="14549347">So, he wrote a letter to Mr. Pratt and Mr. Pratt read that letter over the telephone to Mr. Bekaert, a man in Delco and said, “What about this?</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.831" offset="14582680">And then Mr. Bekaert wrote back and he said, “Well, here is the situation,” and he explained it and he said in his letter, “we are looking into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.701" offset="14610160">I find that our engineering people think they might do better to deal with du Pont."</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.772" offset="14630431">And then he wrote another letter saying, “We find out we can buy from du Pont more cheaply than we can buy from this local supplier.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.824" offset="14658644">And then what happened?</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.324" offset="14664704">Well, they took the one carload from du Pont and that's all that business du Pont ever got.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.749" offset="14682363">They went back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.461" offset="14689259">They went back to the old supplier and continued to buy from him from that time on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.215" offset="14708276">Now, that's a microcosm in a sense of the Government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.132" offset="14719875">It's got everything including the fact that Mr. Bekaert got a very handsome allotment out of his manager's security plan that the Government says would influence these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.893" offset="14758954">And we have Mr. Pratt writing a letter and yet it didn't happen and that's -- that I see is the ultimate comment on his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.477" offset="14793331">Now, I maybe wrong about the facts in this case, counsel sometimes are, but I am sure the facts are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.343" offset="14820707">And as I conclude, there are just two points I'd like -- I'd like to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.519" offset="14837426">We submit that the case should be decided on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.245" offset="14852368">You think it should be decided on all facts and not just part of the facts, the fragments, fragments of the fact and it's on that basis that we submit our case and ask the judgment of the District Court to be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3715.106" offset="14963754">The major portion of this argument allotted to me have been to -- to the questions of control and what questions of law remained to be discussed after we finish discussing the facts which we think are most significant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.777" offset="15018506">Before getting into the major point, I'm going to discuss the question of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.610" offset="15033762">I want to correct both Mr. Davis and Mr. Cox on one of these percentage figures which the Court may think is of some significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.025" offset="15067512">That 93% of everybody has been talking about on paint, was a figure for 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.009" offset="15091440">The Government's own brief says that figure for 1947 is 83%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.533" offset="15109517">If you take out -- the reason I mentioned, that's on page 64 on the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.446" offset="15125191">If you look at the -- if you take out Ford &amp; Chrysler, 83% as we analyze in our brief isn't really disproportionate at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.283" offset="15156537">It was mathematical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.238" offset="15160299">Taking out Ford &amp; Chrysler would be about 80%, so I just make that little correction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.432" offset="15185063">Now, I also want to say a word before I get into the question of control about the -- this antifreeze episode way back in 1925 and 1926 which for some reason, the Government thinks is so significant now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.588" offset="15233755">Of course it has no significance now at all, it's supposed to show some favoritism back then.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.818" offset="15254653">But the Government says that -- is that the General Motors deliberately slanted its manuals so as to favor alcohol which du Pont was making as against glycerin which other people were making.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.687" offset="15302092">Well, all General Motors did was provide eventually that its manuals would state, “Alcohol is cheaper and hurts the paint and glycerin is more expensive.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.156" offset="15347963">It will work properly as Mr. Davis said unless things aren't fitted correctly and then it may severely damage the motor and nobody suggest that isn't true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.611" offset="15377847">The Government says that's slanted because the damage to the motor without -- where the damage to the paint in the eyes of the motors is as it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.382" offset="15404910">“But it was true, and even the glycerin manufacturers according to the record didn't -- didn't object to that statement, only the Government objects to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3831.856" offset="15430823">And how is it unfair or unreasonable for General Motors to give it to make a true statement impartially for the benefit of the public which buys alcohol or glycerin antifreeze, we have some difficultly in seeing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3845.728" offset="15486307">Now, Mr. Davis said, “But General Motors bought glycerin itself, which shows that it really didn't believe alcohol was better.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.040" offset="15511489">Well, there again, there's a little confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3854.239" offset="15520371">As far as the record shows, General Motors didn't buy -- didn't start buying glycerin about seven years later, 1933 to 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.258" offset="15552449">By that time, the industry, the people who -- who serviced automobiles were permitted with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.602" offset="15573765">They knew how to tighten up automobiles so it wouldn't hurt the motors, we all use it today but that wasn't at the time of this particular episode.</text>
            <text syncTime="3876.061" offset="15607620">The emphasis the Government puts on it that our mind indicates how far they've got to go to try to -- to try to make a factual case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.543" offset="15641579">Now, on this question of -- of control, it's a basic control or whatever the Government now calls it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.674" offset="15674075">They called it control all the time in the case up to now, but now, they're diluting it and diluting it and diluting so I don't know if that really is control anymore or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.711" offset="15710229">What they said in their briefs was that this control is a -- is a power in du Pont to direct, sometimes say to influence, the business policies of General Motors closed again in economic advantage over its competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.987" offset="15763310">Now, there are two aspects of that which are important.First, it's a -- it's a power as they defined it in their briefs at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.932" offset="15795075">And secondly, it has to relate to business policies or trade because of this -- this case relates to restraints of trade and we're not talking about anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.888" offset="15834885">Now, what does power mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.035" offset="15839483">It means normally in this context that one group of men can make another group of men do it at once.</text>
            <text syncTime="3939.872" offset="15862888">And here, the question is, "Does the du Pont Company, the du Pont directors or officers, can they make the General Motors officers or directors do what they want?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.698" offset="15902177">We know that in corporation laws, it's often thought that minority stockholders have great power but their -- the substantial minority is here but it's also -- also were recognized that the management may have great power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.676" offset="15946062">And the question here is does the minority stockholder cannot tell the management what to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.766" offset="15966438">That's an issue of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3966.816" offset="15970617">Nobody denies that and it's determined on the basis of the facts of each case as this Court has -- has several times held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.718" offset="16002278">Well now, the Government seems to be backing away from this a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.720" offset="16026206">They say that the -- they admit that the General Motors executives are independent people that they won't do anything contrary to the interest of General Motors, but they still say that they were put in by the du Pont people, Mr. Sloan at least who was in -- in power from 1923 to 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="3999.283" offset="16100498">Presumably, he appointed everybody in that period or the people he appointed, appointed the other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.193" offset="16120142">And therefore, necessarily, du Pont had infiltrated the management.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.782" offset="16138533">The only specific examples they would have to refer to on that are Mr. Sloan if you can call him a du Pont man.He was promoted on his merits entirely from within the company after he impressed Mr. Pierre du Pont of how capable an executive he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="4022.929" offset="16195062">The Government makes a lot of the fact that Mr. Pierre appointed him, but that's the only thing the record shows as to the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.605" offset="16221811">Mr. Pratt, he is also called by the Government a du Pont man.</text>
            <text syncTime="4034.571" offset="16241664">I refer Your Honors, I'm not going to read it, to General Motors' Exhibit 201.</text>
            <text syncTime="4039.528" offset="16261517">It's on -- most of it is quoted on page 20 of our brief, but I commend that to you to find out how much of a General Motor of a du Pont's dude Mr. Pratt was.</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.240" offset="16296312">He told the du Pont's of a lot whenever he was dealing with Mr. du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.058" offset="16311568">When he was dealing with some of the subordinates, he would do them very occasionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="4056.074" offset="16327659">Well anyhow, let's get back to how these executives that infiltrated General Motors so they would -- so the General Motors people would do what du Pont wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.478" offset="16365275">We don't have to speculate as to this, as to whether they would -- du Pont minding which is really what the Government is talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4073.582" offset="16397667">Mr. Raskob, you've heard about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.125" offset="16403832">He is the man who in 1918 predicted that General Motors would be controlled by du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="4081.379" offset="16428910">Look what happened to him in 1928.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.101" offset="16439777">In 1928, he became Chairman of the Democratic National Committee and Mr. Sloan didn't think that was consistent with his job as spokesman and Chief of the Financial Department of General Motors, and he told him he had to resign one job or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4097.102" offset="16491813">The whole du Pont family came to the support of Mr. Raskob.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.042" offset="16503515">They thought it was all right for a man to be in business and in politics at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4103.917" offset="16519084">This included the Republican du Pont as well as the Democratic du Ponts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.725" offset="16534235">There were some Democratic du Ponts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4109.738" offset="16542281">[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="4112.345" offset="16552730">But, what happened?</text>
            <text syncTime="4113.538" offset="16557537">Mr. Raskob was forced to resign and all of -- later, he remained in the General Motors Board of Directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4119.402" offset="16580942">Never again was he a member of the General Motors executive branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.859" offset="16594840">And Mr. Pierre du Pont who was the Chairman of the Board as you've all heard, he resigned because he was so angry at what Mr. Sloan did to Mr. Raskob.</text>

            <text syncTime="4154.734" offset="16722317">But Mr. -- Mr. Coleman du Pont, Ex-Senator Coleman du Pont supported Mr. Raskob, so this isn't a part as it matter at all, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4165.133" offset="16763904">In any event, the great power of the du Ponts over General Motors as Mr. Raskob had predicted didn't protect Mr. Raskob 10 years after he made the prediction, which supports what we have said already about the trade relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.407" offset="16816985">Whatever Mr. Raskob predicted in 1918 as to du Pont getting a General Motors business was in a couple of years just proved it wasn't so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.038" offset="16847496">They competed for it just as they did for anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="4189.069" offset="16859617">Well, there are number of other incidents in which the du Ponts made suggestions to the General Motors people, told them what they thought should be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4199.930" offset="16903084">I haven't got time to go into many of them in the argument, there in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4204.591" offset="16921788">The whole du Pont family opposed Mr. Sloan's ideas as to reorganization of the General Motors Committees in 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="4211.856" offset="16950836">All three du Pont brothers and Mr. Carpenter I believe, but Mr. Sloan went ahead and reorganized the committees as he wanted to have it done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4221.321" offset="16988662">In the chapter of the lead episode of which -- of which you've heard, Mr. Irenee du Pont didn't want General Motors to negotiate with Standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4229.627" offset="17021889">Oil, he said du Pont should negotiate with Standard Oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="4232.723" offset="17034219">But Mr. Sloan went ahead and joined with Standard Oil informing the Ethyl Corporation without even telling the du Ponts about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4241.167" offset="17068074">Mr. Irenee du Pont opposed Sloan's policy of specifying to get standards for ethylized gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="4247.162" offset="17092002">He opposed Sloan and Sloan is the one who insisted on closing down the ethyl production plans after the disaster at Bayway which you've heard about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4256.720" offset="17130245">All of these things Sloan did or at least they did what Sloan wanted and not what the du Pont's wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4262.582" offset="17153651">And finally, the du Pont's opposed the Ethyl Corporation going into the production of gasoline which eventually brought them into intense competition with the du Pont Company but they went ahead anyhow and did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4273.986" offset="17199313">That doesn't sound as if General Motors or the Ethyl Corporation for that matter was controlled by du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="4279.627" offset="17221883">Well, now, the Government now says that it doesn't deny that the General Motors official's act could always in the interest of General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4288.258" offset="17256364">And I call your attention to the findings which are unchallenged on pages 316 and 321 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.046" offset="17299519">One sentence on 316 says, “Sloan's testimony on the record as a whole as convincing that at all times, he acted independently and steadfastly in the interest of General Motors.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4311.523" offset="17349465">That's an unchallenged finding."</text>
            <text syncTime="4313.715" offset="17358242">And then if you turn over to 321, the Court said about the same thing or this time, he included all of the top General Motors executives in the finding, right in the middle of 321.</text>
            <text syncTime="4323.631" offset="17397948">It's also unchallenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="4325.498" offset="17405367">He said, “Sloan, Kettering, Pratt, Lawrence Fisher, Lyna and Wilson are among those who would have been influenced if the Government's testimony is correct.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4334.067" offset="17439640">These men, the record shows, acted at all times solely in the best interest of General Motors, and I think that means they weren't considering du Pont at all certainly in the context in which it has spoken.</text>
            <text syncTime="4345.501" offset="17485406">They were thinking only of General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4347.697" offset="17494183">Now, what does the Government mean then by this control which it's talking about?</text>
            <text syncTime="4351.594" offset="17509752">I think it comes closer to what Mr. Justice Frankfurter was suggesting earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="4355.925" offset="17527097">It really isn't a control at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.284" offset="17532531">It means that in the field of purchasing, if a product is sold by du Pont, the General Motors people will look at it and if they think it's about as good as -- as the competitive product, they'll buy that without being told.</text>
            <text syncTime="4371.813" offset="17590627">The significant thing is they make the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4373.879" offset="17598882">Du Pont doesn't make the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4375.123" offset="17603897">Du Pont doesn't tell them what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4376.614" offset="17609853">It never has told them what to do except in these sales efforts to which Mr. Cox referred as to Lammot du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="4382.939" offset="17635140">Mr. Cox in the haste to finish the time he had available over, he forgot to say that all those efforts by Lammot du Pont were successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.005" offset="17667427">He never made any of those sales he was trying to make when he referred to the stock interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="4409.223" offset="17740257">The record indicates that all that General Motors is purchasing except during the period of the General Purchasing Committee are made by the buyers for the -- for the divisions, the people whose credibility the Government doesn't challenge and whom it admits buys on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4423.853" offset="17798771">Now, I would like to give a couple of examples about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4427.664" offset="17814026">The one Mr. Cox cited about plastic for steering wheels isn't in the briefs, the one where the General Motors buyer said that he didn't give a damn of who produced the product, du Pont or anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.090" offset="17855718">That's Exhibit -- du Pont Exhibit 401 if you are interested in following that dramatic expression up.</text>
            <text syncTime="4445.164" offset="17884035">Mr. Weckler who was a disinterested witness who bought for Buick for 12 years, but by the time he testified, he'd been with the Chrysler Company for 20 years ending up as General Manager of Chrysler.</text>
            <text syncTime="4455.262" offset="17924472">When asked why he bought Duco for Buick, was he motivated in anyway by filling if there was an obligation of favor that du Pont Company, he said, “No, sir, and that's an idea that never occurred to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="4466.532" offset="17969507">And I never know in my experience that the Buick Motor Company had any difficultly in buying any material from anyone at anytime."</text>
            <text syncTime="4473.533" offset="17997511">And the antifreeze buyer who -- present General Motors antifreeze buyer testified.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4478.477" offset="18017259">For a while, they bought almost all their antifreeze from du Pont until sometime after the war when they found that somebody out -- they could get it from somebody else on better terms and they turned to this other supplier.</text>
            <text syncTime="4489.958" offset="18063235">So at that -- by that time, only automobile bought antifreeze from du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="4493.689" offset="18078177">He was -- he said, “No one ever indicated to me that we should favor du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="4497.447" offset="18093119">When you are running a big organization, you just can't run it with a lot of strings tied to it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4502.151" offset="18111927">"Were there are any strings tied to your purchases of antifreeze?"</text>
            <text syncTime="4505.209" offset="18124257">"Absolutely not."</text>
            <text syncTime="4507.963" offset="18135228">There are some other -- some other exhibits as to casehardening, a du Pont report.</text>
            <text syncTime="4516.210" offset="18168247">This is a contemporaneous document written in 1931.</text>
            <text syncTime="4520.318" offset="18184652">There is only a slight difference in price that's favoring us, du Pont, and practically no difference in composition between ours and the competitive result.</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.959" offset="18215163">But here again, prejudice is against us, that's at General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4531.605" offset="18229791">These instances are typical of the bias which exist in favor of some of our competitors in their materials, irrespective of price.</text>
            <text syncTime="4538.197" offset="18256123">And I mean you can call that a salesman's exaggeration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4541.205" offset="18268244">He was running to his own people, this wasn't prepared for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4544.480" offset="18281305">And another du Pont report in 1934 on break clearly says, “Contacts at General Motors' research laboratories have been much less satisfactory than anywhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="4554.396" offset="18320906">In fact, only there have we met other than a cordial reception.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4557.961" offset="18335222">And he points out how they're selling Chrysler in Rio, the very same products.</text>
            <text syncTime="4561.604" offset="18349746">They can't even get a reception on it, the General Motors research laboratories.</text>
            <text syncTime="4565.515" offset="18365419">Those are exhibits also not in the briefs, du Pont Exhibit 369 and 384.</text>
            <text syncTime="4571.616" offset="18389870">This record was just so vague that we couldn't find evert -- think of everything in time even to put in this big reason and they're also pretty big as you may have observed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4580.406" offset="18424978">There is some talk about arms length -- absence of arms-length bargaining here of the very fact that they couldn't -- that du Pont couldn't sell to General Motors all these times when it tried to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4590.006" offset="18463431">Proves arms-length bargaining in itself, but there are great many general agreements situations which show arms-length bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="4596.645" offset="18489971">And I'd like to call the Court's attention to a passage on page 1905 of the record to 1906 in which a du Pont representative told about his difficulties in bargaining as to a price for the sale of stock of the Kinetic Company when du Pont bought it from General.</text>
            <text syncTime="4616.214" offset="18568234">As I won't read that, it will take too long but I -- the bargaining took 10 months before they could agree on a price and on a basis that it was even greater length and arms length, the record would indicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4630.685" offset="18626121">Well, the Government didn't want to talk about the people who do the actual buying and selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="4634.001" offset="18639391">It wants to talk about the central management of General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4638.165" offset="18656005">It doesn't attack the credibility of the buyers and sellers who testified they weren't influenced by the stock ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="4643.458" offset="18677217">So far as I can see, it doesn't attack the credibility of the officers of General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4646.793" offset="18690591">It admits in its reply brief that Mr. Sloan was credible.</text>
            <text syncTime="4650.359" offset="18704802">That means it isn't attacking his -- his credibility and it doesn't seem to attack anybody else's.</text>
            <text syncTime="4655.599" offset="18725804">It doesn't attack anybody's credibility, it just asks this Court to make findings that everything they testified too was wrong which is just about the same thing because no documents clearly require any such conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4669.052" offset="18779617">But the only time when the general management had participated in the buying for General Motors was in the period of -- of the General Purchasing Committee, 1923 to 1931.</text>
            <text syncTime="4679.304" offset="18820577">That Committee was composed of the leading buyers for the General Motors divisions, Mr. Pratt, Mr. Sloan, Mr. Lyna who was the executive secretary and one or two other people from the central management.</text>
            <text syncTime="4692.499" offset="18873344">The Government originally said that that Committee was the heart of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4696.092" offset="18887764">Now, they don't want to talk about it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.724" offset="18902288">There, the trial court made findings that actions taken by the Committee were seriously detrimental to du Pont in a number respects and that it dealt with du Pont only in the same manner as it did with other suppliers and the Government doesn't challenge that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4714.519" offset="18961429">Now, the philosophy of that committee which was headed by Mr. Sloan and Pratt, the people of the Government says were du Pont representatives, the people who du Pont put into General Motors, is stated in the letter by the secretary, Mr. Lyna to a du Pont affiliate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4730.323" offset="19024645">This isn't -- this isn't something written for the trial in 1928.He says, “They were trying to get some business.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4736.814" offset="19050663">And he said, “In the making of our purchases, we believe that each transaction sustained on its own feet and its own merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4743.191" offset="19076159">If the quality of your product and service consistently with prices quoted are the best he can obtain, he will buy it from you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4749.938" offset="19103117">That means the General Motors Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="4753.662" offset="19118059">There's a contemporary document that General Motors Exhibit 201 to which I referred you is another example of Pratt's speaking for the General Purchasing Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4761.986" offset="19151287">Now, this committee headed by the top General Motors executive in the period closest to Pierre's presidency in General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.450" offset="19177200">In fact, it was appointed originally by Pierre du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="4772.362" offset="19192769">It made strenuous efforts to get a competitive product for Ducos, as soon as Duco is invented to make sure that General Motors would buy from other Corp companies as well as du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="4782.120" offset="19231848">It insisted upon a two-source of supply policy across the Board not just for du Pont, but it wanted to make sure that they would have other sources of supplies in du Pont as well as from other people, not at that the result of reducing du Pont's sales although everything else was equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4795.525" offset="19285452">Nobody contended at that time Duco or du Pont products weren't as good as the others but they wanted to have other sources of supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="4804.498" offset="19321396">Importantly, the -- this Committee insisted and got du Pont to grant what is called a “super discount,” a greater discount than other people were giving, overall discount in order to get increased business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4816.056" offset="19367581">They weren't just allowed to meet somebody else's price, they had to give a bigger discount to get the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4821.432" offset="19389106">That doesn't sound as if these people were motivated by a desire to favor du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.304" offset="19408541">Now, this Committee operating in the field in which -- closest to that in which that Mr. du Pont was the President of General Motors, and we don't deny that -- he control General Motors in a sense between 1920 and 1923.</text>
            <text syncTime="4840.955" offset="19467160">The judges' finding was that since then, there hadn't been any control.</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.177" offset="19480116">This Committee not only didn't favor du Pont, if the Government has completely given up on the strong argument it made in the court below that there was any favor to them as a result of that Committee's activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.584" offset="19545736">Now, one other fact --</text>

            <text syncTime="4869.829" offset="19582725">There wasn't -- only in those three years, Mr. Pierre was the President of du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="4874.650" offset="19601951">Theoretically, as president, he could have made them do what he wanted.Actually, the record for those years shows two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="4881.628" offset="19629850">First, all the main steps he made were in the direction of getting out of lessening du Pont's control of General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4888.005" offset="19655346">Secondly, when it came to these purchasing matters, he wrote letters indicating he was interested in what -- of the amounts du Pont sell to General Motors, but he kept his hands up.</text>
            <text syncTime="4896.926" offset="19691081">On these two sources of supply powers, he said, “I disagree with that policy but I can't -- I'm not going to say you can't do it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4902.636" offset="19713964">So that -- although he was a chief executive, there was no more favoritism in purchasing for General Motors during that period and there wasn't any other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4910.771" offset="19746461">As to general control, I can't say he didn't control during that period.</text>

            <text syncTime="4980.860" offset="20026807">That gets down to these other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4982.546" offset="20033599">We don't think that 23% or for that matter of 38% necessarily controls the company.</text>

            <text syncTime="4991.185" offset="20068080">But the fact, the most important facts as to whether one company or one group of people controls another is -- is, did they control them to -- could they make them do what they wanted?</text>
            <text syncTime="4999.533" offset="20101517">I think the Government has given up on that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5001.320" offset="20108622">It doesn't say that du Pont could make -- du Pont people could make the General Motors people what do if they wanted, a lot further back in 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="5009.171" offset="20140074">But I had also -- supposing they control it up to 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="5012.826" offset="20154702">This case wasn't brought to 1949 and now, its 1956, you find it 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="5018.706" offset="20178213">You don't grant relief under the Sherman Act for things which terminated at least 12 years before a suit was brought and -- and we don't think there wasn't any control up to that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5028.800" offset="20218546">The Government stresses membership on the Board of Directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5033.061" offset="20235577">Well, the trial judge found and that this finding isn't challenged that Mr. Sloan or the president picked the management members of the directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5042.834" offset="20274657">They were the majority of the directors at all times and they were elected automatically after he picked him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5047.571" offset="20293674">He didn't consult with anybody as to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5050.626" offset="20305899">There were five or six du Pont directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5052.395" offset="20313004">There were some outside directors as to which everybody was consulted which everybody agreed on, but the trial judge found that -- that didn't show that these outside directors were du Pont representatives even though du Pont's like others were consulted and sometimes suggested who should be named as outside directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5069.519" offset="20381445">But the Government -- Government also stresses du Pont membership on committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="5073.390" offset="20396910">Now, I haven't got time to go into that except to say, and there's one thing about the committees as another thing about the Board and the committees together.</text>
            <text syncTime="5081.033" offset="20427525">The Operating Committee, the only one which would have charged of purchasing or things of that sort hasn't had a du Pont on it since 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="5090.223" offset="20464306">And for the prior period when there were two committees, it didn't have a du Pont under there after 1934, from 1934 to 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="5096.898" offset="20490951">But more importantly, neither the Board of Directors nor any of these committees so far as the record shows, there was anything to do with purchasing or the types of transactions we're concerned with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5106.678" offset="20530134">In fact the record shows the contrary because the affirmative evidence was that they didn't deal with any of these things, and in a corporation as big as General Motors, he wouldn't expect the Board of Directors to be concerned with the kind of things we're dealing with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5119.399" offset="20580916">Now, the one thing the Government lays great stress on is the compensation plan system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5128.525" offset="20617488">The Government says that because an original compensation plan in effect between 1923 and 1930, that was the last date, gave the General Motors executives tremendous amounts of money which it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="5143.189" offset="20676106">They were necessarily loyal to du Pont from hence -- form hence forward I assume.</text>
            <text syncTime="5149.463" offset="20701184">Now, the General Motors compensation plans provided and remained except for these two plans, one of which expired in 1930 that bonuses are paid of certain percent of the return now to about up to 10,000 of the employees of General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5164.254" offset="20760430">Now, what they get depends upon how well the company does, how well their individual division does and how much they can contribute to it individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="5173.607" offset="20797837">There isn't a shred of evidence to show that any of them were influenced or that anybody tried to influence them by -- in relation to what they did for -- for the du Pont Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="5185.341" offset="20844753">The Government -- in fact, the evidence shows that -- that these plans are just a contrary effect as one -- one witness, Mr. Carpenter of du Pont testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="5193.755" offset="20878399">He said it would have just the reverse effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5195.694" offset="20886131">These men know that the amount they get depends upon how much General Motors makes and the du Pont Company could go bankrupt for all the effect it would have on their compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="5294.307" offset="21280580">That comes to the other committee which the Government says has control of these bonuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5299.991" offset="21303359">That's now called the bonus and salary committee and it has had two or three du Pont representatives out of five of its members in the last 10 or 15 years since it was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="5310.338" offset="21344737">The reason for that is that they exclude from that committee all management people who might be eligible for bonuses and that -- and a large proportion of the directors who are left are du Pont representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="5321.791" offset="21390503">But more importantly, you may say, “Well, that still gives them control.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5325.025" offset="21403460">But the fact is, that committee doesn't look and see it, tell to decide how much each of these 10,000 or more people is going to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="5331.484" offset="21429269">It just passes upon the general program, possibly determines how it can be allocated between the divisions of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="5338.728" offset="21458317">And the evidence affirmatively is that the amount recommended by the president of the company to that committee has never been changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5345.402" offset="21484962">Now, that -- so, it's just fictitious to say that the General Motors people must be in fear but if they don't cartel to the du Ponts, their bonuses are going to be cut.</text>
            <text syncTime="5354.397" offset="21521011">That just is imaginary, it never has happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="5457.473" offset="21933223">All the conduct from then on shows that whatever Mr. Raskob may have intended in 1917, that isn't -- hasn't been any -- an intention for at least 25 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="5471.711" offset="21990170">Secondly, if you assume an intention that the du Ponts all along intended, “We're going to make General Motors buy from us.</text>
            <text syncTime="5478.900" offset="22019009">We're going to sell to them everything we can because of our stock relationship,” and nobody paid any attention to it for 35 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5484.977" offset="22043251">They never sold any because of that or dribble out of a great amounts that have been sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="5490.736" offset="22066343">We don't think that would be a restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="5493.160" offset="22076061">The reason that power and intent together sometimes been said to be illegal, particularly under Section 2 of the Act is because they lead to -- definitely would lead to a restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="5504.848" offset="22122768">Well, when you haven't had a restraint for 35 years, to our mind, the intent alone becomes irrelevant and what's more.</text>
            <text syncTime="5510.964" offset="22147218">You can't have both power and intent for 35 years and not have anything that result from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5516.466" offset="22169266">If you had -- if you had intent and no restraint, there couldn't be power because it just wouldn't work.</text>

            <text syncTime="6038.214" offset="24256240">First, Mr. Justice Reed asked me about authorities for a stock relationship being a combination, and I stated that there were no cases that I knew of certainly in this Court where a less than a majority of control was held to be a combination, but I said that the stock interest as such, the none consensual type of -- of combination has been recognized.</text>

            <text syncTime="6125.810" offset="24606595">I -- I gave the wrong number, 393 at the bottom of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="6132.199" offset="24632195">That is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="6132.891" offset="24634911">I wanted to call attention to 381 of the record, the evidence page I just gave because fairly in Mr. Cox's argument, he said he was going to point out other places in these findings where there were findings by this Court that were inconsistent with positions we took.</text>
            <text syncTime="6153.731" offset="24718294">And I was interested to find where there were findings of the Court that were inconsistent, and the only reference that I heard made was to the findings with respect to Fisher Body which we do not accept too and which appear on page 381.</text>
            <text syncTime="6169.639" offset="24781928">There is a statement there which may be broader than -- than I would make it but I still take no exception to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6177.878" offset="24814843">It says the record shows that Fisher Body at all times conducted its purchasing with respect to finishes, fabrics and other products in accordance with its own best judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6188.325" offset="24856639">And basically, that was our -- that is precisely our position that Fisher Body did that and that that is why there was a difference between the Fisher Body purchases and the purchases of the rest of the divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6199.777" offset="24902510">Now, to be sure, there is no cutoff date on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6202.961" offset="24915257">It doesn't say that Fisher Body ever started in buying like the other -- like the other divisions and maybe in that respect, it is against our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="6213.653" offset="24957994">But basically, this is the position which we take and we have no exceptions to the findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="6220.441" offset="24985161">There was some considerable discussion by Mr. Cox about failure of du Pont to sell products other than paints, fabrics, antifreeze, to the General Motors organization and specific reference was made to case-hardening chemicals and some other chemical products.</text>
            <text syncTime="6244.419" offset="25081083">They tried -- I -- I would say that du Pont tried to sell products to General Motors, all of its products to General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="6251.961" offset="25111176">They failed in some cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6253.963" offset="25119222">We haven't gone into the details as to these minor or less important products.</text>
            <text syncTime="6261.162" offset="25148061">We feel that if we have established that there is a restraint of trade with respect to paints and fabrics which has been the subject of most of our -- the facts in our brief which are the most important products involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6275.597" offset="25205739">The fact that they failed to restrain trade in other products is -- is not a -- is not an excuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="6280.376" offset="25224861">It's not a -- it doesn't destroy the fact that there is still a restraint on paints and fabrics.</text>
            <text syncTime="6293.062" offset="25275643">There was a suggestion made at the beginning of Mr. Cox's argument that the thorough investigation which the Government had made should have enabled us to produce affirmative evidence of people being hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="6309.685" offset="25342098">If this is a -- if this is the kind of a restraint of trade which hurts people, then we should have put on the witnesses of the other chemical companies in this -- the paint companies to say that they were hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="6325.668" offset="25406046">As this case was tried below, it was tried really on a -- on a written record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6331.010" offset="25427362">I think there was probably a feeling that if we ended into competition with the defendants in bringing forth oral testimony that they probably could submerge any testimony we had in -- in many thousands of words of testimony of their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="6350.907" offset="25506983">And so, the case was really tried on -- on the written record as of that time.And the written record does not have any because it comes lively from General Motors and du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="6362.016" offset="25551391">It does not have any -- any substantial amount of -- of evidence as to what happened to competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="6368.389" offset="25576887">There was however, one example, one sole example back in the early days when du Pont first bought General Motors' stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="6376.745" offset="25610324">There was a man by the name of Mr. Mountain that had the Flint Varnish &amp; Color Works.</text>
            <text syncTime="6381.468" offset="25629236">And the Flint Varnish &amp; Color Works at that time sold very substantial amounts of paint to General Motors, most -- most of General Motors' requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="6390.699" offset="25666121">Well, Mr. Mountain who was not slow to understand of what was going on, he said, “Well, if du Pont has bought this interest in General Motors, I am not going to have any business left.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6401.313" offset="25708648">And he went around and he offered types to make a bargain with -- with du Pont to staying in and start sort of a partnership basis.Now, what really happened was that du Pont then bought out Mr. Mountain entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="6414.150" offset="25759953">They bought the Flint Varnish &amp; Color Works entirely and Mr. Mountain, I don't say they didn't buy it at fair price, but Mr. Mountain was out of business and du Pont was in the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="6431.113" offset="25827871">With respect to the tetraethyl lead picture, I think it should be made clear that there was no assignment of the -- of the Dr. (Inaudible) patent to -- to du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="6446.423" offset="25889102">It wasn't handed over.</text>
            <text syncTime="6447.561" offset="25893595">What happened was that du Pont entered into the manufacturing end of manufacturing tetraethyl lead and sold it to the Ethyl Corporation which in turn licensed gasoline companies to use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6463.148" offset="25955976">There's one interesting thing about the -- the sales which they made, the -- one would expect in -- in the -- if there was arms-length bargaining that they would have sold the tetraethyl lead at a price which was a fair competitive price that was determined by cost of production -- I don't know, and be determined on some basis that -- of bargaining between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="6485.514" offset="26045419">What happened in this case however was that du Pont made a calculation, a rough calculation that they would receive one-third of the profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="6495.377" offset="26084916">General Motors would receive one-third of the profits.</text>
