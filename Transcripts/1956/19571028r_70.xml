            <label>Mr. Osmond K. Fraenkel</label>
            <text syncTime="14.789" offset="59141">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.126" offset="64470">I would like briefly to remind the Court of the facts of this case which comes under subdivision (g) to which reference has already been made, namely, the subdivision which deprives an American national of his nationality if after conviction by court-martial for desertion in time of war, he is dishonorably discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.460" offset="185783">In this case, we had a man who was 20 years old, taken by the American forces to Casablanca, who there got into difficulty with the military authorities and was placed in confinement, who escaped and was brought back.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.711" offset="266762">And some couple of weeks later escaped a second time was away a day and on the second -- on the first whole day surrendered to American patrols as he was walking some miles away but back towards the place from which he had escaped.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.059" offset="360176">And as he said at his court-martial trial, and I'm referring to 5 (a) of the -- what is now the -- 4 of the record, “My organization is now in Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.546" offset="454113">I thought it would be possible for me to rejoin my organization and there I might get a brigade commission commander that would reopen my case.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.425" offset="493610">At the time Lieutenant (Inaudible) picked us up, we had decided to return to the stockade.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.854" offset="515344">The going was tough.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.500" offset="521927">We had no money to speak of and at the time we were on foot and we're getting cold and hungry.”</text>
            <text syncTime="137.421" offset="549616">Now, that was a technical desertion under the Articles of War because he was absent from a place of confinement which is a place of unpleasant duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.616" offset="614400">Here, of course, there is involved no question of dual nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.603" offset="634358">No question whatever of foreign relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.421" offset="661629">There is the bare question where the Congress has the power to deprive a native-born American of his citizenship because of some act fully unrelated to the conduct of foreign affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.055" offset="736131">An act serious in its nature, of course, but for which other punishment has been provided by the Articles of law -- of War, other punishment which was in fact imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.040" offset="808124">And we submit that there is nothing in any of the decided cases which so much as suggest this power in the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.540" offset="854100">That all of those cases can be subsumed under general heading of control over foreign relations, and dealing with problems that might arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.308" offset="937169">Now, we have suggested in our brief, one, in our original brief and the other in supplemental brief, two possible grounds on which this basic constitutional issue could be avoided by this Court, by way of statutory construction, the Government will have none of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="392.449" offset="1569750">One, that in order to save the statute from constitutional attack, desertion to the enemy must be implicit in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.400" offset="1609561">Of course, that involves a problem of foreign relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.291" offset="1637146">That was my original point.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.851" offset="1643311">The Yale Law School point is that the statute requires that the dishonorable discharge be the result of the conviction for desertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.597" offset="1694302">Here was a single sentence imposed on pre-charges for each one of which dishonorable discharge was a possible penalty under the Articles of War and therefore no one can say for which of them the penalty was imposed.</text>

            <text syncTime="441.874" offset="1767445">Well, one of them was certainly of a minor character, absence from -- without leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.040" offset="1788134">The others were escapes from military confinement and two escapes from military confinement might very well rank as much more serious than this one day technical desertion which really was not a desertion in the popular sense at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.509" offset="1849992">I'm sure if anyone were asked and were -- they would say this was absent without leave from -- to be sure from a military confinement rather than from an ordinary camp.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.536" offset="1890116">But there was nothing here which indicated any attempt to get away from obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.635" offset="1910491">This -- as I say, the – the soldier himself, within a day, was walking back.</text>

            <text syncTime="517.870" offset="2071406">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.169" offset="2072660">Now, to greet the issue head on.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.852" offset="2091363">The Solicitor General has already indicated that he believes that Congress has the power to decree loss of nationality as an inherent attribute of sovereignty in a number of situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.504" offset="2157923">I will not quarrel with the basic thesis that Congress has the power to provide conditions upon which nationality may be surrendered or even under certain situations to indicate that unequivocal acts constitute such surrender.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.372" offset="2241411">But I say, that power is circumscribed by the nature which gives it being, since there is nothing in the Constitution whatever which deals with the issue other than the Fourteenth Amendment declaration, citizen -- persons born are citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.175" offset="2320614">Now, what is it -- the basic concept which gives Congress the implied power?</text>
            <text syncTime="587.491" offset="2349871">It is the fact that this is a sovereign nation dealing with other sovereign nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.443" offset="2373695">And the question of nationality may under circumstances assume importance in the dealings of Congress or the executive -- when he does, with other nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.232" offset="2432836">And the Congress may, therefore, prescribe certain rules of conduct which facilitate the conduct of our foreign relation.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.130" offset="2484454">But at the moment you go beyond that basic reason for the existence of any power at all, the power ceases to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.508" offset="2530011">And therefore, Congress does not have the power which the Government in his brief seeks to attribute to it, namely, to decree loss of nationality where a citizen does something which Congress thinks is inconsistent with his obligations as a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.170" offset="2624679">That, I say, is wholly outside of congressional power.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.045" offset="2652160">And I say that the same result is accomplished if you view it from the due process aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.954" offset="2687791">In my brief, I have viewed it from both and it doesn't really make any difference because as I say, the rational connection between certain acts and loss of nationality must inhere, in the relation of those acts to other nationalities and not in the heinousness of the act done.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.444" offset="2797714">There'd be an ordinary crime, whether it'd be an election crime, whether it'd be a defiance of the decisions of this Court or whatever the nature of the act which is considered serious and worthy of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.934" offset="2871693">It has nothing to do, no matter how much anyone may say in Congress or in the pulpit or anywhere else other than I hope in this Court that the act results in an indication of abandonment of allegiance.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.387" offset="2969496">Now, how does that apply to desertion in war time?</text>
            <text syncTime="749.104" offset="2996349">Desertion in war time is, of course, a serious offense, under certain circumstance, punishable by death.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.183" offset="3040653">It's probably at least serious in the particular case involved.</text>
