          <heading>Argument of William A.Wilson</heading>
          <turn speaker="william_awilson" startTime="0.000" stopTime="381.161">
            <label>Mr. William A.Wilson</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- to two of the case authorities mentioned by the petitioner in support of the position expressed at page 9 of the petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.816" offset="194644">I should like now to refer briefly to the third of those cases, Terminal Railway Association against Fitzjohn which petitioner cites in support of the statement that mere breach of the similar duty, again referring to the shipowner's duty to provide safe appliances and to provide a safe place to work, satisfies the negligence requirements of the Federal Employers' Liability Act where the injury was sustained on the property of another over which the railroad has neither knowledge nor control.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.242" offset="348348">In the Fitzjohn case which was decided by the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, there was a question as to a portion of the trial judge's charge to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.813" offset="414595">The Court said, "Complaint is made concerning a statement of the trial court in its charge to the jury, that it was the duty of a railroad company to furnish its employees with a reasonably safe place in which to work."</text>
            <text syncTime="94.570" offset="481677">The Court of Appeals said that the inclusion of that sentence in the charge was not error because -- and I read again from the opinion, later in the charge, when the Court came to charging the jury specifically respecting the basis of defendant's liability, the following language was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.717" offset="570284">It was the duty of the St. Louis Terminal Railroad Association to use reasonable care to provide a reasonably safe place for its employees to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.246" offset="628381">The last of those four cases is Storgard against France &amp; Canada Steamship Corporation cited by the petitioner in support of his statement that mere breach of the duty satisfies the negligence requirements of the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.758" offset="714376">The Storgard case was decided in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1920 and was -- and referred to a judgment entered in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in 1918, and two years before the Jones Act was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.393" offset="812910">The Storgard case referred to the entitlement of a seaman to recover damages for injuries that he allegedly sustained as a result of a defective bolt on a mast of the defendant's vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.172" offset="892008">The petitioner has quoted certain language from the Storgard case at the foot of page 10 of its brief referring particularly to the doctrine of reasonable foreseeability to which I should like to come later in argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.717" offset="966196">But at the present time, I should like to refer the Court to the full text of the sentence in which the fragment quotation at the foot of page 10 is taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.325" offset="1008724">There, the Court of Appeals said, “If the bolts was worn and defective and the shipowners knew or ought to have known the fact then they considered that the seaman would be entitled to recover damages for injuries as a result.”</text>
            <text syncTime="249.626" offset="1101928">The respondent submits that not one of the four cases cited under the section to which I referred the Court before the recess supports the principle proposed by the petitioner that there is, in any sense, an absolute liability cast upon a vessel owner under the provisions of the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.149" offset="1204015">Respondent submits that the principles which controlled the question of recovery or not in the Jones Act case are those general common law principles that control the question of recovery or not in any common law negligence action.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.191" offset="1288129">The Court of Appeals held that it was error here for the trial court to deny the respondent's motion for a directed verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.561" offset="1321566">In its opinion, the Court of Appeals said, “There being no proof of fault on the part of a shipowner, defendant's motion for a directed verdict should have been granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.091" offset="1379767">The respondent submits that the record fully supports that decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.332" offset="1400665">There was no evidence that the respondent negligently failed to provide the petitioner with this proper tools for his work.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.120" offset="1443819">There was no evidence that the respondent was negligent by reason of any defect of machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.389" offset="1480913">There was no evidence that the respondent had any reason to foresee in the circumstances the possibility of any danger to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.153" offset="1535979">In the first place, there was no evidence that the respondent failed to furnish the petitioner with proper tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.747" offset="1570356">The petitioner was furnished with a mechanical ice cream scoop, a standard design that's used commercially for serving ice cream.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.288" offset="1604524">There is no contention here on petitioner's part that that scoop was in any way defective.</text>

            <text syncTime="523.158" offset="2196041">The question now -- just a couple of more questions Mr. Ferguson to get back to the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.182" offset="2220074">When you found that this ice cream was hard, did you know that this knife to which you refer was right there nearby?</text>

            <text syncTime="2023.672" offset="8198040">May I refer briefly to the Manhat case which Mr. Engelman referred to in his principal argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.404" offset="8232939">That was the case where the plaintiff was precipitated in the dark by the failure over the falling of one of the lashings securing a lifeboat that was hung out over the side of the respondent's vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.757" offset="8298350">Particularly with regard to the issue of foreseeability, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in that case said, "The prospect of the falling of the lifeboat under the circumstances presented here did not possess those elements of reasonable foreseeability which would impel the conclusion that reliance upon the Rottmer-type releasing gear constituted a failure to exercise that degree of care which could be expected of a reasonable manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.193" offset="8444113">Under no theory said the Second Circuit, could a standard be considered reasonable which imposed upon the shipowner, a duty to safeguard absolutely against the possibility that the handle would be moved by one of these men.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.866" offset="8526869">What it all boiled down to is the difference between the exercise of reasonable care on the one hand as contrasted with the taking of every conceivable precaution or adherence to the highest standard of care on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.349" offset="8612760">Now, possibly the exercise by the respondent here what every conceivable precaution or adherence by it to the highest standard of care may have avoided this accident but quite clearly, such conduct on the respondent's part was not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.217" offset="8684231">The record is bare of any evidence to indicate violation by the respondent of any reasonable duty that it was imposed on it under the Jones Act to anticipate the possibility of harm to the petitioner under these circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2257.330" offset="9132701">All we know is that it was a knife of about eighteen inches in length with a handle of about four and a half inches and an unguarded blade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.524" offset="9173452">I refer to the characteristic of the unguarded blade because the petitioner in his testimony to which I refer the Court contrasts this knife with a French knife which does have a guarded blade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.142" offset="9239907">The petitioner argues that the simple tool doctrine has no application on the Jones Act case and with this, the respondent certainly agrees because the simple tool doctrine is concerned with the issue of liability of a master with regard to his servant in a situation where the master provides the servant with the defective appliance of such a simple character that the defect is or should be apparent to the servant and by virtue of that fact the master is exonerated from liability caused by that obvious defect because of the principle of the assumption of the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.166" offset="9404061">Now, respondent readily agrees that that can have no place in the Jones Act case because there's no room for assumption of the risk in the Jones Act case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.019" offset="9431437">So, any reference by the petitioner here to applicability of the simple tool doctrine appears to be out of order particularly because such a doctrine was never proposed by the respondent at any point of the defense and was not referred to in any sense by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.080" offset="9515656">We take it that the -- the doctrine has been brought to the forefront of the argument here by the petitioner with the view to bringing this case somewhat in parallel with Jacob against the City of New York which is referred to at page 9 of the respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.921" offset="9571035">But, of course, the facts in that case and the facts in this are substantially different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.074" offset="9591620">There, a situation was presented where actually a defective appliance was provided by the master.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.131" offset="9619937">Here -- there -- the record is barren of any defective appliance whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.355" offset="9636760">If all -- only defect appears to be the conduct of the petitioner in doing what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.788" offset="9666539">The respondent respectfully submits that the petitioner failed to establish on the trial a prima facie case of negligence against the respondent, had to justify denial by the trial court of the respondent's motion for a directed verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.531" offset="9729546">The petitioner failed to prove that there was any duty owing to him by the respondent that was not fully performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.601" offset="9761729">The Court of Appeals was correct in ruling that the respondent motion for a directed verdict should have been granted and in reversing the judgment of the District Court on that ground.</text>

            <text syncTime="2574.389" offset="10400893">Consequently, he is not familiar with the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.123" offset="10415835">Now, with respect to the knife and the scoop about which the Court required, both of those articles were the ship's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.182" offset="10456064">On the trial of the case, neither of those instruments were produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.372" offset="10476857">Now first, with respect to the knife, counsel has indicated that there was available another knife with a guard, a French knife.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.432" offset="10517086">The record is completely barren that there was any such knife with the guard available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.054" offset="10547597">The evidence to which counsel refers is on page 60 and 61 of the record on the bottom of the page and on the top of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.461" offset="10601200">And the witness is referring to the use of the knife on another vessel, not on this particular vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.145" offset="10639966">Now, with respect to the scoop itself, petitioner produced the dairy expert.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.480" offset="10665253">He wasn't even asked by trial counsel for the respondent whether the scoop could have scooped out or shaved out, as counsel implies, slivers of this ice cream.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.202" offset="10732231">So that those issues, there were no issues of that kind at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.179" offset="10760129">The case stood squarely on the fact that the scoop was an inadequate tool, completely inadequate and there was no request to charge that there was available any other knife which had a protective device which the knife which was used did not have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.292" offset="10832541">Now, with respect to how this ice cream got to be hard, who was responsible for it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.654" offset="10869948">It was clearly the negligence of a fellow servant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.100" offset="10883741">The testimony of the plaintiff is that the third baker or one of the personnel in the steward's department of the ship was charged with the responsibility as to the quantity of ice cream that was to be brought up, placed in this tempering chest for thawing when it was to be brought up, quantity of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.589" offset="10973706">The third baker in turn had a superior, the chef who issued orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.278" offset="10996485">So, on the evidence, as it stands, it's clearly the case of negligence of a fellow servant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.930" offset="11031071">The jury might have drawn that inference or as I said, in my main argument, the absence of proper mechanical equipment aboard ship to soften this ice cream to a point where it was properly dispensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.202" offset="11108185">And the evidence with respect to the third baker is found on page 50 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.255" offset="11136397">A -- a question was asked as to whether this was one of the novel impression with respect to ice cream and it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.221" offset="11176208">There is a case that is not cited by either counsel in brief, in which a shipowner strangely again by the same Circuit -- Second Circuit was found liable in negligence to a longshoreman, a number of them who sustained dermatitis as a result of the bad properties of threshing that oil has that propensity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.132" offset="11295848">And the shipowner said, “Well, we didn't know anything about that that these drums of threshing that oil leaked and all these longshoremen got dermatitis as a result of this commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.238" offset="11348302">And the Second Circuit held that the shipowner was charged as a third party case, was charged with knowledge of the properties of this commodity, what they could have learned had they employed people who were skillful in the trade and could have informed them about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.865" offset="11426879">That is the only other case I know.</text>

            <text syncTime="2846.866" offset="11490826">With respect to the main point in the analysis of my authorities, I don't think that I have made myself clear to my adversary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.652" offset="11533981">I concede of course that no ship can be a storehouse of a vast number of tools and equipment that the duty to supply a tool can only arise out of the nature of the business and reasonable foreseeability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.808" offset="11618617">Therefore, in absence of tool cases, there must always be negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.488" offset="11645367">Here, on the evidence I've described, the jury found that negligence, that failure to provide a tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.752" offset="11682356">Once we have the breach of the duty, then foreseeability is out of the picture because anything that flows from the -- from breach, there is liability.</text>
