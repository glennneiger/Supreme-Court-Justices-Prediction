            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 540, Civil Aeronautics Board, Petitioner, versus Ida Mae Hermann, et al.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.665" offset="153997">Mr. Solicitor General.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="14.332" offset="160684">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.289" offset="184508">This is an action which involves an enforcement proceeding for a subpoena duces tecum issued by an administrative agency, the Civil Aeronautics Board, for a group of documents against the -- a number of respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.344" offset="272697">The question presented by the case is whether or not the agency has the burden of satisfying the District Court in each case, whether each document that is subpoenaed is relevant and material, whether or not it is in possession of the person to whom the subpoena is directed, and whether or not, prior to the issuance of such a subpoena, it must take the testimony in the administrative hearing and determine first the existence and then the location of the documents, and then proceed to inspect the documents to determine their relevancy and materiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.503" offset="473422">The subpoena was issued in connection with a complaint, formal complaint, filed against the respondent which involves a number of parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.589" offset="513755">The complaint charges that these parties are engaged in violation of Section 401 (a) of the Civil Aeronautics Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.569" offset="561612">They are licensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.322" offset="568613">Two of them are licensed as irregular and infrequent carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.303" offset="592541">The complaint charges that they are engaged in operating regular and frequent carriage of passengers and freight in violation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.015" offset="651473">Also, that they are engaged in using the various response in various activities in connection with this operation which are a violation of both the economic regulations and the statute in trying to accomplish this regular and frequent operation contrary to their license, and also, in using and controlling various corporations and nominees so as to be engaged in violation of the regulations of the Board under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.398" offset="824926">The parties involved -- the principal parties are Ida Mae Hermann and Irving Hermann.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.475" offset="865259">And they are individuals who have a partnership known as Nevada Aero Trades.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.566" offset="889605">That partnership has the licenses to certain aircraft, and those are least to the carriers known as Great Lakes Airlines and Currie Transport Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.543" offset="957524">Those are the only two carriers involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.910" offset="971003">Then, there are 12 different corporations known as, Skycoach, with various additions to the name but that's the principle attribute which are agencies engaged in various principal cities in the United States in obtaining the sale of tickets for the transfer and carriage of various people from -- principally, from New York to Los Angeles by way of Chicago or Kansas City or Philadelphia, intervening and back the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.284" offset="1112482">On pages 36 and 37 of the record, it is set out in detail attached to the complaint, an analysis of the various trips that these carriers made of the Currie Transport being bracketed in -- in a square bracket and the Great Lakes Airlines in a -- in parenthesis showing the frequency that the Board charges that they operated in determining or alleging that they are engaged -- were engaged in irregular -- in frequent and regular transport instead of irregular and infrequent transport.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.326" offset="1288652">Now, there were quite a number of documents that were involved in the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.482" offset="1305266">The charge is that this activity, in violation of the licenses covered a period from December of 1951 on through 1953, about 38 months involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.878" offset="1370885">And it's claimed that -- and the Board claims that these two parties, the Hermann's, actually controlled Skycoach, all the 12 corporations that were engaged in selling these tickets, as well as the Nevada Trades, the partnership and a banking corporation that they had which furnished the banking services and another which handled their -- their gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.412" offset="1500975">And these 12 Skycoach corporations, the President was the brother of Mrs. Hermann, one of the two partners and the principal respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.026" offset="1555519">And Great Lakes Airlines Agency, which served as a banking -- doing the banking function for the activities was head as its vice president of Mrs. Hermann's sister.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.480" offset="1617272">So, there's that family connection in regard -- in addition to all of the other aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.811" offset="1642663">Now, it was seemed clear that these various documents that were subpoenaed were relevant to this controversy by reason of -- of the very nature of the complaint and the documents who requested it.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.359" offset="1716851">The documents that were included were the financial records of all of the various respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.915" offset="1743078">The correspondence and agreements between the parties, the aircraft that was used, that in regard to it, the licensing and the -- and leasing and any agreements of that character, the personnel advertising material, personal records, the airline tickets which they are always -- they're supposed to be issued three copies, one for the auditor and one for the ticket agency, and one for the carrier, and there is probably several thousand at least documents that are involved in the request.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.974" offset="1887274">Now, it's apparent that in order to -- to show the nature of the complaint and satisfy the proof required that the agency had to show that this activity which was carried on with -- as alleged deliberately and willfully in violation, and also allege was concealed from the Board had to be proved by records which would be largely in the hands of the respondents themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.014" offset="2043382">And odds complained that the Board had it in its possession the records so that it was not necessary for it to subpoena these documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.941" offset="2083088">The Government concedes as to such records as the Board actually had that there would be no necessity for such a subpoena to be issued, or that the Court would be required to enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.161" offset="2140035">But the fact is and I -- I have been advised by the Board that they did not have these records.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.235" offset="2164276">They had a report in two different forms of the type of -- or the activities in the carriage of passengers which were in the nature of summaries and financial report that was in the nature of summaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.416" offset="2224985">They also had some --</text>

            <text syncTime="535.007" offset="2243375">I -- I don't know that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.759" offset="2250376">I haven't -- they don't indicate the extent of their claim as to what the Government has.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.569" offset="2273677">But I tried to find out from the Board exactly what it had, and on their statement to me, I represent it to the Court, but that is all that we do have in that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.035" offset="2315473">We also -- I also inquired about advertising materials and they had some advertising materials of Great Lakes Airlines, one of the carriers involved here, regular carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.028" offset="2363434">But they had none as to Skycoach, and they had none as to Currie Transport, the other carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.216" offset="2392273">And the Board says that over 99% of the advertising was handled under the name of Skycoach, and by it although they claimed to be under the direction of the two Hermann's.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.890" offset="2438980">So that what little they had was not anything like this, involved in the subpoenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.082" offset="2467715">The Board -- the examiner overruled the objections to the subpoena as being oppressive and they -- and then, the Board acted to overrule such objections, and the District Court overruled the objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.141" offset="2551933">And the District Court first ordered that there should be at 10 days postponement during which time the party should try to see if the information would not be furnished, and the Board proceeded to have its people go to the parties and examine their records and try to get the material and they were unable to obtain any satisfactory examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.871" offset="2658826">They did not get correspondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.229" offset="2668335">They were not able to obtain the certificate of stock that a man by the name of Smith, vice president of -- executive vice president of Currie Transport, had issued to him and said he was unable to find.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.818" offset="2730611">They were the one who know because they claimed that Smith was nearly the nominee for the Hermann's and that they wanted to see the endorsement on the stock to see if the certificates -- to see if it had been endorsed over in blank in that situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="687.793" offset="2854536">It appeared to be the conventional thing to see if they could get together and get it solved between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.880" offset="2878882">But the charges are obviously very serious to these parties, and it -- if the Board's complaint is justified, and they had some information that -- in regard to prior examination of parties in connection with Skycoach that supported the complaint before they ever filed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.934" offset="2971146">It is of the nature that if these records show what the Board thinks they will show, they would be damaging and -- and justify the Board in revoking the licenses which are very profitable and requiring a cease-and-desist which they asked against all of the operations, Skycoach and the various individuals involved.So that they found that they were -- the information in the documents were not furnished in this kind of an experience.</text>

            <text syncTime="3842.798" offset="15474604">But we go out there and we spend 10 days at the Court's suggestion which is entirely reasonable to try to solve this by going out and inspect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.756" offset="15514415">And what do we find?</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.577" offset="15517654">We just played tag with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3855.517" offset="15525491">The -- some of the records are in Attorneys Keatinge and so forth hands, others in their advertising agent's hands, and others in the hands of their accountants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.481" offset="15565302">And then, we can't find -- those aren't produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.147" offset="15579930">And finally, the Court got sick of it too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.601" offset="15593827">We -- we don't insist on behalf of the Government that you -- they've got to bring them to the post office building and the Court was trying to provide a reasonable time by staggering the production and try to have the inspection, but nothing worked, and I couldn't see why it wouldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.552" offset="15665612">This is a very serious situation for these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3893.748" offset="15678360">They've got one cease-and-desist order against the Great Lakes Airlines for operating as an irregular carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.763" offset="15718379">And now, this is a question of whether a whole license be revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3908.185" offset="15736142">Now, they don't have any right to have any ownership of any kind in Nevada Aero Trades, or any of these Skycoach agencies, or any of these other operations if they're connected with some other independent airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3924.462" offset="15801240">And Currie is what they -- they claim they're independent of Currie.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.352" offset="15816808">Although, the Board claims that they just operate altogether measure like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.277" offset="15836453">Now, if we can show by the tickets that after they got the cease-and-desist back there, against one agency, they proceed to operate to Currie and operate them all together, and show how they -- they transferred employees back and forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.790" offset="15902490">They paid them out of this pocket and out of that pocket, and how everything is operated altogether, like he's charged in the complaint and that they took control of these various companies when in -- without any approval of CAB in violation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3967.887" offset="15974902">Then, no Court would hesitate if the Board finds that their licenses should be revoked in a cease-and-desist ordered against them, which is a very serious thing, because they're making lot of money of this operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.241" offset="16024325">No Court would hold that should not be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.099" offset="16039790">But if we have it for one week or two weeks or three weeks or some month, and the Court might say, “Well, what about the rest?</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.859" offset="16066853">Did they quit today?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.260" offset="16076361">So, I think, on the face of it, that we're entitled -- administrative agencies, I urge you, are entitled to go into these things on the presumption within reasonable limits that they're trying to protect the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.922" offset="16139055">And when you charge like they have that here's the whole scheme of a number of cards working together, that these people who put together after they got one cease-and-desist already, to operate together and defeat of the whole purpose of this Act of Congress, it's time that it'd be looked at with the idea of giving the Board a chance to prove the things necessary to establish the facts so that we won't have any trouble of the facts, and then we can apply the law to those facts.</text>
