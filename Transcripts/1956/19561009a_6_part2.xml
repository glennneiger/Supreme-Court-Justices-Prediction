            <label>Mr. Ben Margolis</label>
            <text syncTime="17.888" offset="175919">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.527" offset="190548">In the 10 minutes remaining to me, it is simply impossible for me to deal with the numerous misstatements of fact, erroneous statements concerning the contents of the records, misleading statements by omitting portions of the record, which were included in counsel's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.091" offset="284797">They are contained in the brief, however, and if I have time, I will refer to some of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.070" offset="304650">I want first, however, in the time remaining for me to deal with some of the legal questions principally with some of the instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.466" offset="338296">At page 112 of the brief for petitioners, the Court will find in a footnote the instruction which Judge Medina gave on the issue of in kind of advocacy proscribed by the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.717" offset="411230">And it reads as follows, “In further construction and interpretation of the statute, I charge you that it is not the abstract doctrine of over -- overthrowing or destroying organized government by unlawful means which is denounced by this law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="95.013" offset="484477">Now, let me stop there.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.916" offset="496076">The defense requested the trial judge to advise the jury that it was not the abstract doctrine of overthrowing the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.563" offset="538603">He refused to give that -- that there was involved there.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.542" offset="550515">He refused to give that instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.457" offset="562218">True.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.228" offset="565352">He said that the mere holding of an opinion or a belief or a prediction or a prophecy did not constitute a violation, but he never said that the advocacy of the abstract doctrine wouldn't constitute a violation although he was specifically requested to instruct the jury that the advocacy of the abstract doctrine of the overthrow the Government by force and violence does not constitute a violation of the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.067" offset="684680">Then they, the instruction of Medina, Judge Medina --</text>

          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="147.118" stopTime="156.533">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="147.118" offset="692830">The question is that he affirm -- that he instructive affirmatively what it was and therefore, the failure to deny what it want, it doesn't make any difference.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ben_margolis" startTime="156.533" stopTime="363.608">
            <label>Mr. Ben Margolis</label>
            <text syncTime="156.533" offset="730551">And I will deal with that, Your Honor, in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.517" offset="742463">I -- I wish first of all, I think there are two questions involved as you indicated yourself, Mr. Justice Frankfurter.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.657" offset="770988">One is whether it was done and second if so the clarity with which it was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.731" offset="791364">I submit that on this -- an issue of this important the defense was entitled not only to enact a -- an instruction which is susceptible of a correct instruction -- correct construction of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.493" offset="846326">But they're entitled to an instruction which specifically and explicitly and clearly spelled out the law and this we never got.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.342" offset="873806">We never got an instruction which said, “That abstract doctrine is not covered by the Smith Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="197.309" offset="893659">Now, let me go on with Judge Medina's instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.072" offset="904735">Now, he goes on, but the teaching and advocacy of action for the accomplishment of that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.953" offset="940157">We said in the trial of that case, we want an instruction which says, “It isn't just the teaching and advocacy of ideas, but it is the teaching and advocacy of action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="222.861" offset="995850">He refused to give that instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.532" offset="1006508">At no -- nowhere in his instruction will you find the word action.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.408" offset="1033989">Medina -- Judge Medina, however, wasn't satisfied even with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.503" offset="1054365">He went to say -- he went on to say, “By language reasonably and ordinarily calculated to incite the persons to such actions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="246.223" offset="1089264">We ask that he give that with respect to the type of language to be used, but he refused to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.558" offset="1114655">Now, let us take the instruction that he did give.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.533" offset="1126567">First of all, he gave a definition in which he stated to the jury that the word “advocate” and the word “urge” mean exactly the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.700" offset="1175155">He said the word -- and here I am referring to the appendix to appellant's brief which I previously referred to at page 32.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.296" offset="1213607">He said the word “advocate” means to urge or to plead in favor of, to support, vindicate or recommend.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.632" offset="1250910">In other words, he threw “urge” in with all of these phrases and definitions which include the urging or advocacy of ideas as distinguished from the urging or advocacy of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.159" offset="1324993">Never once did he say, “It is action that must be urged, not an idea must be urged.”</text>
            <text syncTime="310.803" offset="1347563">Now let me point this out from the standpoint of clarity to counsel here and perhaps to me if I hear someone say, “Urge the advocacy, the overthrow of the Government by force and violence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="323.683" offset="1399077">It might mean urge action to accomplish that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.174" offset="1417049">But one can also urge that as an idea, as a philosophical concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.377" offset="1437947">The word -- use of the word does not limit the definition to a situation in which only urging of action or advocacy of action is what it is covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.067" offset="1480683">It can be either urging or advocacy of the idea or urging or advocacy of action and therefore, the instruction was at large on this issue and it permitted a conviction for the urging or advocacy of ideas as distinguished from the urging or advocacy of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.557" offset="1558632">Now --</text>

            <label>Mr. Ben Margolis</label>
            <text syncTime="382.764" offset="1635432">Which was more damaging almost than anything else he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.949" offset="1648180">What does he say?</text>
            <text syncTime="387.315" offset="1653614">The holding of a belief or opinion does not constitute advocacy or teaching.Of course it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.417" offset="1678064">We were told -- we wanted an instruction, not that you couldn't hold beliefs or opinions but that only advocacy of action was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.183" offset="1709098">He said, “Hence the Smith Act does not prohibit persons who may believe that the violent overthrow and destruction of the Government of United States is probable or inevitable from expressing that belief.”</text>
            <text syncTime="414.008" offset="1760402">In other words, he said, “You have a right to say that in your opinion this is probable or inevitable.”</text>
            <text syncTime="420.493" offset="1786420">And then he goes on to say, “whether such belief be reasonable or unreasonable is immaterial, prediction or prophecy is not advocacy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="429.249" offset="1821424">So, there he is saying there certain kind of ideas that you can urge.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.862" offset="1839815">Certain kind of ideas that you can --</text>

            <text syncTime="438.315" offset="1857682">But he says -- he -- he does not include within those ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.570" offset="1878685">He does not even include as an idea that can be entertained, overthrow the Government by force and violence as a duty and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.324" offset="1909718">He doesn't even include that as an idea, would you have a right to hold and a right to urge upon others for acceptance as an idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.815" offset="1943677">By this first paragraph -- by this first paragraph, he eliminated the very thing that we say -- of a he -- he removed protection from the very thing which we say is protected under the First Amendment which Dennis said is protected under the First Amendment, to wit the urging or advocacy of the idea of the overthrow of the Government by force and violence and asking people to accept the idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.588" offset="2058721">This instruction is clearly as it was possible for the judge to do unintentionally and knowingly, willingly on his part permitted the jury to return a verdict of guilty as to each of these petitioners for the advocacy of ideas and nothing more without regards to whether or not action was even urged by any of these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.179" offset="2149104">This, I submit, is a clear violation of the First Amendment.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ben Margolis</label>
            <text syncTime="521.638" offset="2190900">Well, we think that the Court should still reach the issue of the insufficiency of the evidence, because that would dispose of the matter once and for all.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.329" offset="2229666">It would not merely result in it being sent back for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.670" offset="2243041">But if the evidence, as we contend, was wholly insufficient then what should be done is that the matter should be sent back with instructions to dismiss the proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="945.775" offset="3887501">They say he taught the class on Marxism-Leninism and then they read Marxism-Leninism.</text>

            <text syncTime="1002.473" offset="4114244">With respect to the question concerning that double question of the Court, I wanted to read this that occurred later on in the record after the colloquy that was referred to when they were discussing, the one or two question matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.346" offset="4177774">And I read from the record at page 13,721 and that is volume 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.439" offset="4218107">The Court “I won't ask them that, I would ask them to answer if any of them feel or if any of them happened to have heard something or seen something which has affected them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.329" offset="4253738">And they feel it might affect their ability to serve with absolute impartiality as a jury if they so feel to stand up and say so but you must appreciate that this is a very delicate situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.528" offset="4298459">I would only do it as I say if the defense urged it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.325" offset="4313715">Mr. Schullman We are urging, except we are urging it to be done in this fashion, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.199" offset="4337225">I mean I am not talking about phraseology.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.390" offset="4349973">We are urging it to be done in a fashion so at least we have two concrete questions that occurred later on in the record after the colloquia referred to default.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.319" offset="4393650">Now, if Your Honors pleased with respect to the last question addressed to Justice Frankfurter by Mr. Margolis and the Court asked the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.233" offset="4437326">I believe that our two petitioners at a stage, long before there were any instructions, should have been dismissed from this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.061" offset="4476615">I don't believe there is any evidence that added them in as conspirators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.973" offset="4496259">And I believe a very careful analysis of our brief which takes up every single item and goes into every inference as I said yesterday and shows the tenable inferences of absolute innocence all the way along the line that at that time, the trial court should have been acted and dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.710" offset="4575253">And I believe if the record shows that that then this Court should do what the trial court should have done under the record that was presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.213" offset="4613287">Irrespective of whether or not it is an unusual matter, I believe, that the justice required that where the evidence in a criminal case is not sufficient, the tenable inferences of innocence all the way along the line and not anyone other inference that could be drawn that then at that time the case should have been dismissed as to these particular petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.086" offset="4700745">And if this Court, if it sees it that way that they should also follow the rule and -- and order a dismissal as to our petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.229" offset="4737317">I'm speaking only as to our petitioners because of this voluminous record, we have limited our research and our checking to the evidence that particularly refers to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.465" offset="4778277">We find out from the answer of the respondent that there's very little disagreement in our analysis of that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.468" offset="4818296">I was just told that by Mr. Monahan that he agrees with us on the Connelly elevator the deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.600" offset="4850792">Connelly went up in the elevator three times in three years or six times in three years and has no record of being on any list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.958" offset="4884229">There is no record of whether he went in morning, noon or night and there's no record if there was any meeting at the time he went up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.987" offset="4908366">And that we contended for in our answer and Mr. Monahan has conceded that that's accurate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1507.992" offset="6136330">I presumed you can speculate as to whether or not the instructions were clear or solve from the length of time that they were out, I don't know whether that's appropriate enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.318" offset="6181679">Now, the analysis of the evidence, we find nothing either in the answer of respondent or in his argument that in anyway challenges our contentions as to its instability, texture of sand, lack of the type of character that should be used or permitted to be used and sent to a jury under the rules of the criminal law with respect to the exclusion of reasonable doubts and the presumption of innocence and the rule that tenable testimony of innocence prevents them to be -- entirely all the way through would prevent the case from being sent to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.842" offset="6359730">And that purpose, I believe, that long before these instructions or any of these other things came up, the duty then lay on the trial court to dismiss the case with respect to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.396" offset="6406019">Now -- now, in the Dennis case, the expression as -- that we intend to overthrow the Government by force and violence as speedily as circumstances would permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.236" offset="6473310">Now, that doesn't mean we just intend to overthrow the Government with force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.792" offset="6499537">Let's assume its arguendo by all means because it would be purely hypothetical with respect to our petitioners and I think any other petitioners here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1615.575" offset="6566724">How are we going to equate the phrase “as speedily as circumstances will permit?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.976" offset="6592324">Does that mean any time, years hence or does not that have an element, an import of immediacy?</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.856" offset="6631821">The word “speedily” suggests immediacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.471" offset="6646241">It might -- maybe if they said if passed and when, it wouldn't mean anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="1648.531" offset="6698486">But when the limitation of that “speedily as circumstances” would permit, is placed in there, it means something.</text>
