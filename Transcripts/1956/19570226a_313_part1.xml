            <text syncTime="42.492" offset="273324">Your Honors, in light of my past and current collateral relation to the Court, I think before beginning the statement of this case I ought to say that although I'm still a regular Assistant Attorney General in charge of certain appellate work for the State of Illinois, the Attorney General of Illinois has no interest in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.442" offset="369142">I appear as privately retained in the course of general practice by the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, and my appearance here doesn't imply any approval by the Attorney General of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.356" offset="428805">This case, if Your Honors please, and the companion case which has become mooted by settlement and will not be argued how presented to this Court as they presented in the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.818" offset="514696">First, the question whether the National Railway -- whether the Railway Labor Act of 1934 prohibits or makes unlawful strikes in the interstate commerce of the railroad business are affecting that Commerce when such strikes are over minor or past or accumulated frequencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.598" offset="657742">The petitioner, Brotherhood, says that the Act does not have that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.106" offset="687835">The carriers say that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.141" offset="699956">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in this case held that the Railway Labor Act of 1934 does interdict strikes over minor or past grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.099" offset="759724">Five days later, the Fifth Circuit in the Central of Georgia case made a declaration.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.270" offset="800475">It is diametrically contrary in its rationale, in its principle, and in its logic, although, there are effectual distinctions between the two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.507" offset="849377">A second and the only other question presented by the case at bar -- I beg Your Honors' pardon --</text>

            <text syncTime="198.725" offset="898278">-- the Central of Georgia case did not reach the question that I have just stated, but turned solely upon its answer to the second question that I am now going state.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.919" offset="947075">The second question is whether assuming that the National Railway Labor Act does make strikes unlawful, even so, that even indulging that assumption does it so far repeal by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.538" offset="1033488">The Norris-LaGuardia Act of 1932, as probably two years before the -- the Railway Labor Act of 1934, has to reinvest federal courts with the jurisdiction to enjoin strikes over past grievances or minor accumulated individual grievances even though such strikes are not attended by any violence or anything of that sort.</text>

            <text syncTime="446.135" offset="1887901">You're putting those on one side, and you're also of course putting aside proceedings by the Government and the period of the Norris-LaGuardia Act doesn't apply to that?</text>

          <turn speaker="william_c_wines" startTime="454.378" stopTime="1161.158">
            <label>Mr. William C. Wines</label>
            <text syncTime="454.378" offset="1920920">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.465" offset="1929279">Now, there is this background, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.602" offset="1953729">As Your Honors know until 1932 there was great debate in the arenas of politics, practical and ideal, economics, social philosophy and theory as to what the -- what rights labor ought to have to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.367" offset="2064802">And assuming that labor was exercising a right which might be challenged, how far should the drastic remedy of injunction as distinct from some other form of sanction be applied to deter or prevent peaceful strikes in the field of labor in general, not confined of course to the field about the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.889" offset="2186951">The Norris-LaGuardia Act was passed after deliberations that really goes back, not necessarily as to the draft of that Act but as to the policy enacted as far back in a labor relations issue want to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.109" offset="2255809">Now, there isn't a -- now, there isn't any doubt that in 1934 Congress was actually by a real desire to minimize strikes in the railroad industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.852" offset="2378794">Before 1934, the only means of settling disputes of any kind between railroad employees and te carriers have shorter strikes and possibly some kind of action for a breach of contract would be arbitration by system boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.397" offset="2504913">Nobody could be compelled to submit his grievances to those boards, and when the system boards acted, they acted as courts of -- as boards of arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.583" offset="2573667">Now, in 1934, Congress passed the National -- the Labor Railway -- the Railway Labor Act with the purpose, we not only admit but insist and emphasize of diminishing, minimizing, reducing the likelihood of railroad strikes and the number of such strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.132" offset="2699891">And as counsel for the respondent quite correctly pointed out, and that everyone converse withdrawal with the subject knows the National Railway Labor Act does distinguish between two different categories of claims, grievances, and hence of threatened potential or possible strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.383" offset="2828936">The inter -- counsel for the respondent have done, I think, an excellent job in respondent's brief in pointing out that strikes over major grievances or claims over major grievances are settled in one way.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.752" offset="2914408">They are settled by a mechanism of mediation and conciliation, if necessary by executive presidential intervention, and finally if all negotiations fail the Brotherhood calls a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.163" offset="3015973">Now, there is a different type of claim and that type of claim arises over past grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.111" offset="3063829">In the instant case, the case that I am arguing, some 19 individual claims for compensation, promotion, in one case reinstatement, had accumulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.374" offset="3152854">The employing railroad is the Chicago River and Indiana Railroad Company, attempts to negotiate to settle these claims on the premises of the company had failed and the petitioner, Brotherhood, its officers and members announced an intended strike to continue unless demands for settlement of these individual claims were met.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.951" offset="3327143">Thereupon, the railroad filed these claims with the Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.170" offset="3372074">Petitioners and the claimants, individual claimants, have not submitted their claims to that Boar.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.397" offset="3412929">And before the time set for the strike, the respondent, Railroad Company, obtained from the District Court of Illinois -- filed a suit for injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.771" offset="3478444">The District Court of Illinois held, as we contend, and as the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit later held in the Central of Georgia case, that the Railway Labor Act does not repeal pro tanto the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.019" offset="3571440">Denied a permanent injunction but, although, disclaiming jurisdiction did enter a -- an injunction restraining the strike to be effective while the case went to the Court of Appeals, sort of a supersedeas injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.885" offset="3654928">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, rejecting petitioner's contentions to the contrary, held first that the Railway Labor Act does interdict strikes over minor grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.529" offset="3725458">And second, that it implements that interdiction by reinvesting United States District Courts with jurisdiction to enjoin strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.931" offset="3783137">As I have said, five days later in the Central of Georgia case, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reached a quite contrary conclusion and declared that the Act, the Railway Labor Act, does not inhibit strikes -- does not repeal the Norris-LaGuardia Act so as to reinvest the federal courts with jurisdiction over -- to grant injunctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.024" offset="3959515">Now, there is a great deal of discussion in the briefs of petitioners and respondent in the instant case, which in retrospect of reading our original brief which I largely wrote.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.367" offset="4060871">I now proceed to turn very much on the new answers and relative import of the word "compulsory." Throughout the legislative history, marshaled by both of the briefs, you'll find much discussion as to whether or not submission to the Adjustment Board was to be "compulsory" or "mandatory” or whether it was to be optional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.977" offset="4223248">Now, the truth of it is, if Your Honors please, that whether or not strikes were to be enjoined isn't -- was not at the time that the Railway Labor Act of 1934 was before Congress was not a peripheral question at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.259" offset="4360443">It was in the faults and not in the penumbra of the spotlight of legislative attention that was turned upon the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.817" offset="4406627">This is not like the many cases where Congress has clearly intended to regulate a certain area of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.609" offset="4457827">And some months or years later you get a particular question as to whether or not a particular activity is or is not in interstate commerce, or whether or not a particular type of activity does or does not, if an interstate commerce constitute a violation of the Sherman Act or some other act, even the Dyer Act which Your Honors passed yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.279" offset="4612472">As those questions arise, and we all know that while we speak and speak intelligently and seriously and correctly about elucidating the intention of Congress, what we mean is, is this really within the policy that Congress intend to do an act when we're quite sure that Congress didn't have in mind the specific set of facts in a particular case that comes to this Court for elucidation or expounding of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.721" offset="4726262">This was not such a problem.</text>
