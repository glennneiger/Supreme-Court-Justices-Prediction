            <label>Mr. Joseph A. Lowther</label>
            <text syncTime="8.930" offset="139055">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.097" offset="155773">I should like to amplify briefly upon my answer to the Chief Justice's question at the close of yesterday's hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.796" offset="198510">The Chief Justice asked -- assume that in a -- an instance, in a hypothetical instance, it was shown that intentionally and knowingly, a representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation was sent to investigate sitting jurors but that -- and that, rather, on a hearing conducted after the fact had become known, the reaction of those jurors as inquired into by the trial court was the same as the reaction of the jurors in the case before the Court, the Gold case.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.613" offset="361827">And my -- and the Chief Justice's inquiry was, "Would that necessitate a mistrial or a new trial if the mistrial had been denied?"</text>
            <text syncTime="72.102" offset="391816">And my answer was, it would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.501" offset="405400">As I view it, the question then evolves, why would it, in that instance, if the reaction of the jurors weren't the same?</text>
            <text syncTime="85.112" offset="443852">And my answer to that, Mr. Chief Justice, and members of the Court, is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.785" offset="462555">That if it were shown in a hypothetical instance that the Government itself was guilty of misconduct which it undoubtedly would have been where it to send the FBI to investigate jurors, that incident in and of itself, apart from the reaction of the jurors, whether they were the same as in the Gold case, would be sufficient to use a phrase to shock the conscience of the trial court and call for a mistrial, not because the reaction of the jurors in the hypothetical and in the present case were the same but because the Government was guilty of misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.464" offset="649279">And I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, that that is the distinguishing feature of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.093" offset="671744">Now, briefly, may I advert very briefly to one of two other points with respect to the situation that was before the Court yesterday during the Government's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.569" offset="737677">It is clear in the first place that the calling of the remaining 11 jurors including the two arguments by Judge McLaughlin singly for interrogation by him was done with full consent of the petitioner, defendant in the court below, appearing at page 1646 of the transcript of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.773" offset="850422">The thing that the petitioner in the court below did not want the trial judge to inquire into when he called the remaining 11 jurors in was, they are subjective reaction to the -- the contact, if they had heard of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.550" offset="921579">But under the Remmer decision, the Court was bound to do so because the first Remmer case said, "He must inquire into the impact of the jurors."</text>
            <text syncTime="212.909" offset="955016">And Judge McLaughlin did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.149" offset="967973">There is another point that I should like to call to the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.942" offset="987094">The reason that the jurors who were interrogated by the trial court exhaustively and fully and fairly were not told that the contact was not the result of anything on the part of the defendant, Gold, or on the part of government counsel in the Gold case was because when the Government counsel suggested that that be done, there was an objection on the defendant's part.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.921" offset="1107048">And that objection appears, if Your Honors please, on pages 1625, 1627 of the record as I read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.653" offset="1141948">If Your Honors please, the last point is that the Remmer case, as both of them say that in a situation where there has been a communication with that sitting trial juror, there arises not an absolute presumption, but a rebuttable presumption that the burden rests upon the Government and rests heavily upon the Government to rebut the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.025" offset="1243512">This situation before Your Honors is not the Remmer case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.435" offset="1269112">The vice of the Remmer case, as I view it, was that the trial judge, after the contact was brought to his attention, didn't tell the defendant a thing about it, an ex parte almost in secret, investigated the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.181" offset="1348106">And the first time that defendant knew anything about it was after the Remmer trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.599" offset="1369736">There was no hearing immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.488" offset="1381334">Here, there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.626" offset="1385827">There was a full hearing, an exhaustive hearing conducted by the trial judge in which all parties were called before the Court and there was full opportunity for the defendant to ask questions if he wanted to or to pose questions to be asked if he wanted to and it -- and they did that, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.165" offset="1468061">I respectfully suggest --</text>

            <text syncTime="462.285" offset="1952475">In closing on the point, if it please the Court, the presumption was rebutted in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.422" offset="1985076">There was a full and there was a fair hearing by a learned trial judge who excused two jurors, the latter of -- the second of whom had said he never heard anything about the incident (Inaudible), who exercises discretion to the utmost and who was in the position to view the jurors, view the witnesses and in the best position.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.290" offset="2096567">May I suggest to the Court in the exercise of his discretion to determine whether the trial should and could go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.961" offset="2131257">Judge McLaughlin, in the court below after the hearing, said that the trial should go forward and it's the government's position that he did that in the exercise of the discretion given to him and that that discretion should be upheld in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.587" offset="2205759">This is not the Remmer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.898" offset="2214954">There was no evidence that any of the jurors were under terrific pressure as the jury foreman in Remmer testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.915" offset="2251003">Now, with respect to the two witness perjury rule so called, it is true that the trial court refused to instruct the jury on the perjury rule, namely, that you must find the falsity supported, rather contradicted by the -- testimony of two witnesses or by one plus corroborative circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.914" offset="2355075">The Government says that the court was amply justified in refusing that instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.582" offset="2377749">For these reasons, Section 9 (h) of the -- of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, which is the nonCommunist affidavit provision states, at the very end, that in respect to such affidavits, the provisions of Section 1001 of Title 18, United States Code, shall be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.083" offset="2471685">That language was written by Congress in 1947, a little more than two years after this Court had handed down its decision in Wyler in which it reversed the trial court and said that in a perjury case, the instruction must be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.836" offset="2538768">But I submit that this Court also mentioned in the Wyler case, "We have seen no legislation in derogation of the perjury rule even if it be archaic."</text>

            <text syncTime="1472.528" offset="5993514">He was also taught the use of aesopian language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.542" offset="6013576">That was testified too by the witness (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.867" offset="6026846">And that it further appeared from the record that in 1935, Gold presided at a Communist Party meeting wherein the question of Communist getting back into the AFL arose and that it was told to Gold and told to those present that they should use every artifice and every device even the denial of membership to get back into the AFL.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.018" offset="6131440">And further, in 1948, Gold attended a Communist Party meeting in which the top echelon of the Party presided in New York, in which the whole question was what to do about the Taft-Hartley affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.592" offset="6189746">And it's clear from a testimony of the witness Akert, if the Court please on that point that the discussion there again was the use of false resignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.152" offset="6231960">It's clear further from the witness Lautner that one of the devices used by the Party for false resignation was the use of registered letters which is precisely what the defendant Gold did when he wrote the Secretary General of the Community Party, “Dear Gust, I am hereby resigning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.141" offset="6303953">Fraternally Yours, Ben Gold.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.127" offset="6315865">In other words, if the Court please, this case was submitted not on any can't resign theory on count number one, it was submitted to the jury and he didn't resign, his resignation was false, and the jury was entitled to infer not only from that but from evidence as to subsequent actions of Gold when he attended the 1951 and 1952 Mayday Parades which the evidence showed where Communist control and was on the stand with Williamson, Dennis and the rest of the hierarchy of the Communist Party and spoke there and was at the parade and spoke in 1952 that if he had made a bonafide change in allegiance, in other words, that severed his membership, he never would have been allowed near Union Square in May of 1951 and 1952.</text>

            <text syncTime="2008.399" offset="8137017">Namely, that it not passed over all the issues in the case other than the FBI's communications with the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.306" offset="8172648">Aside from this FBI episode, this trial was marked by numerous other unfair circumstances, those were intentional and were not unintentional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.922" offset="8227088">If this case goes back to -- for a retrial, they will be repeated if this Court remains silent on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.116" offset="8255822">We say that there should not be a repeat performance in this case on the retrial, whereby Mr. Lowther would once more intimidate a jury of government employees by introducing weeks of lured testimony on the claim that he is proving the admitted fact that Ben Gold had been, for 30 years before his resignation, a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.681" offset="8350072">And we don't think that he should be permitted by the silence of this Court to wit induce the jury that Mr. Gold is still a member of the Communist Party because he could no more resign from the Party than a soldier from the army.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.699" offset="8406183">And we don't think that the Government should be allowed to use Manning Johnson whose credibility and veracity in the (Inaudible) case, they found themselves unable to defend and who is a self-admitted perjurer to the knowledge of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.056" offset="8467623">Moreover, despite Mr. Lowther's highly erroneous statement of the facts, on this record, there is not one shred of adequate reasonable evidence of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.328" offset="8520704">And we don't think that petitioner should go through another unfair trial without the protection of the perjury rule under misleading and vague instructions.</text>
