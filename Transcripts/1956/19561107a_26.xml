            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 26, the Leiter Minerals, Incorporated, Petitioner, versus United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.265" offset="148459">Mr. Morton.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="perry_w_morton" startTime="19.144" stopTime="509.101">
            <label>Mr. Perry W. Morton</label>
            <text syncTime="19.144" offset="179911">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.060" offset="203630">This case is not here today on the merits, except to the extent required to show that the federal court has jurisdiction of a case presented by a sufficient complaint and to show the propriety of its issuance of the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.854" offset="314807">The lower courts unanimously had no doubt about any of these points.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.330" offset="344691">I would just as soon argue the merits today but I shall not thrust this upon the Court's time by any extended statement of them, beyond that which may be necessary in counter statement to the discussion yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.833" offset="434657">The petitioner's entire case, on the merits, hangs on the Louisiana Act of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.244" offset="484394">That was so admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.021" offset="499440">Here, the petitioner finds itself on the horns of a dilemma.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.284" offset="524518">On the one hand, the petitioner cannot prevail if the Louisiana statute is interpreted as not impinging upon the Government's contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.019" offset="575404">Since then the contract stands in the clear of it.Likewise, the petitioner cannot prevail if the Louisiana statute is held to affect the Government's contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.377" offset="648861">Since then it necessarily impairs the obligation of that contract and falls in a heap of unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.628" offset="697866">Yesterday, Mr. Plauche, several times referred and one time named the so-called Nebo case, decided by the Fifth Circuit a few years ago in connection with this very same statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.417" offset="769024">But in Nebo, the United States bought the land expressly subject to a perpetual mineral servitude, outstanding in the hands of third parties, under whom Nebo eventually claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.749" offset="850317">Nevertheless, except for the intervention of the Act of 1940, the United States, although it had not contracted for the minerals would have become the owner of the mineral rights under the Louisiana law of prescription, in the absence of any exercise of the mineral servitude for 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.187" offset="968077">Thus, on the familiar rule that a statute of limitations can be altered at the will of the legislature, the Fifth Circuit held in Nebo that the rights, which the United States would, otherwise, have acquired only by prescription, had properly been rendered imprescriptible by the Act of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.701" offset="1082180">But the present case is as different from Nebo, as an express contract is different from a statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.313" offset="1132648">Here, the United States bought this property including the mineral rights on certain specific terms, which as to the mineral rights, were very materially different from the consequences of statutory prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.290" offset="1212583">Mr. Marshall may deal with those differences in greater detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.713" offset="1230242">I will pick just one of them for illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.218" offset="1248214">Under the Louisiana rules of prescription, the drilling of a single dry hole, in good faith, would interrupt the running of this period of limitation and extend it for another 10 years as to the entire acreage, in this case more than 8700 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.310" offset="1344658">But under the contract in the Leiter case, the reserved rights were defined and limited in meticulous detail and made finally to expire on a day certain, April 1st, 1945, absent the carefully stipulated development requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.270" offset="1440475">And thereupon, said the contract shall, “Complete fee,” become vested in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.808" offset="1486555">The rights of the United States originated in a contract made with the Leiter estate on March 14th, 1935, only a few days more than 10 years prior to the April 1, 1945 expiration date.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.011" offset="1579447">And that, of course, readily explains the various references in the contract to a 10-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.512" offset="1613406">The deed made in 1938, after the Leiter estate complications had been closed up was merely in consummation of the 1935 contract and copied its terms verbatim.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.456" offset="1677145">I cannot recommend that as a good conveyancing practice but you know it often happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.595" offset="1709746">Now, beyond this brief preliminary review of the merits, I should like to summarize and set them in outline, the points, which have to do with the position of the Government in this case, in its posture today.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.758" offset="1778395">The position of the Government boils down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.568" offset="1793651">The only issue on the merits of either this case or this case in the state court is a dispute about who has the title to the minerals and the mineral rights involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.706" offset="1858226">And that is necessarily a dispute squarely between the petitioner and the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.884" offset="1894902">The United States has submitted that issue to adjudication in the federal court, as it had a perfect and clear right to do under familiar Section 1345 of 28 U.S.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.366" offset="1948818">There is nothing here about the Government hiding behind its wall of immunity, because this is a title dispute, the United States is an indispensable party.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.595" offset="2009736">The suit in the state court is in effect a suit against the United States, which has not consented to be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.095" offset="2035754">The United States is not, cannot be made and cannot become a party in the state court litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.586" offset="2077759">Without the consent of Congress, no officer of the United States has any power to inject the United States or its property into any court, whether it be state or federal in the posture of a defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="609.622" offset="2541902">I'm going to have more to say in just a minute, but I hope by this time in this summary outline, we may have seen the conclusion that the state court has no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.812" offset="2598640">On the other hand, the federal court in which the United States is the plaintiff, has before it all of the parties interested in a full and final adjudication of the title.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.240" offset="2656319">And that necessarily means, that the federal court has exclusive jurisdiction, while the state court has none.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.513" offset="2689442">It is only the protective arm of the injunction here on review, which safeguards the Government from the eminent threat of inestimable and irreparable damage to its property.</text>

            <text syncTime="669.412" offset="2780975">Most certainly, I will.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.964" offset="2799261">At the hands of an assailant, which has prevailed upon a state court for Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, to assume a pretense of jurisdiction to determine the Government's title behind its back, now, as shown by the undisputed proof and as found by the two courts below, there can be no question about the eminence and the irreparability of the damage, which will befall the property of the United States if the petitioner is allowed to proceed in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.711" offset="2938232">And as I indicated, Mr. Justice Reed, I have considerably to say on that subject, in a few moments.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.047" offset="2971564">Much preliminary argument is made unnecessary by the petitioner's frank admission here yesterday, page 30 of its brief, that in the absence of the United States, any decree made by the state court could not be res judicata against the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.397" offset="3048991">In fact, what there is left of the petitioners case after that admission, I fail to see.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.902" offset="3078980">If, as I believe, and as the petitioner apparently admits, no decree of the state court can bind the United States or its property.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.553" offset="3125582">How can any proceeding in the state court stand as a bar to the case in the federal court?</text>
            <text syncTime="761.584" offset="3149720">If what the petitioner wants, in good faith, is a binding adjudication of its title, it would seem that the petitioner should rather welcome than resist the progress of this case in the federal court, which alone can make a binding determination of what claim to title against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.930" offset="3231117">The petitioner's insistence upon resisting the injunction here certainly suggests that there is ample need for one.</text>

            <text syncTime="1504.934" offset="6123081">The petitioner contends that we are relegated to an intervention in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.990" offset="6151293">Article XLIII of the Code of Louisiana practice is the one, which governs the character of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.186" offset="6180133">It is the Article which the petitioner itself has invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.110" offset="6199777">You'll find it printed at the bottom of page 3, in the top of page 4 of the petitioner's brief, if you care to turn to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.065" offset="6235617">There at the top of page 4 in the second paragraph, you'll find in something to this effect, that when in such a case in Louisiana known as a petitory action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.740" offset="6282324">The lessee shall declare to the plaintiff the name and address of his lessor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.830" offset="6310640">Then what happens?</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.364" offset="6324851">The lessor, “Shall be made a party to the suit and who must defend it in the place of the tenant, who shall be discharged from the suit.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.837" offset="6374693">Now, under those expressed words, how could the United States get into that case except as a defendant?</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.050" offset="6407607">The statute makes the petitory action, a title action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.656" offset="6425997">It has been so interpreted consistently by the Louisiana court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.492" offset="6445328">The petitory action has to be brought by one who is out of possession against one who is in possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.641" offset="6481899">Leiter qualifies as a plaintiff, so far as this point is concerned because it is out of possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.763" offset="6506454">The United States does not qualify as a plaintiff on this point because it is and long has been in possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.304" offset="6560580">I'm told by petitioner's brief that there's an article in the Louisiana Code 392, which says how a petitioner in intervention shall proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.799" offset="6618572">It does not say that all interveners are plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.736" offset="6638320">And in fact, Article 389 of the same code makes it clear that interveners may also be defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.164" offset="6664025">And in any event, in a Louisiana petitory action, there's only one way to get in, if you're a lessor named by the lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.724" offset="6706239">And that is as a defendant, you may be a cited defendant or an uncited defendant but you can't be an intervener, as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.117" offset="6751796">Now, in reference to this Louisiana practice point, it maybe noted finally that the particular judges who heard this case in the two courts below are all along practiced in Louisiana law and three out of the four of them are members of the Louisiana Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.959" offset="6823163">They're in unanimous disagreement with the petitioner's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.284" offset="6840508">Were it not then for dependency of the case in the state court, the petitioner would surely have to agree that the federal court does have jurisdiction over the case presented by the complaint of the United States to quiet its title and such jurisdiction is specifically given by 1345.</text>

            <text syncTime="1784.371" offset="7240808">First, as demonstrated by a long line of federal decisions I won't try the name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.686" offset="7262124">They're on page 37 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.312" offset="7276648">With none to the contrary, 2283 and its predecessors do not apply to the United States for the reason that a restrictive statute will not be applied to the sovereign without express words to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.523" offset="7333491">And this Court, in a very similar situated -- this situation in the United Mine Workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.091" offset="7355747">Several years ago, case was mentioned yesterday, held very much to the same order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.566" offset="7389602">In that case, this Court was of the opinion that the anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act did not prevent an injunction at the suit of the United States because it did not expressly include the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.441" offset="7445086">The Clothing Workers case was also mentioned yesterday.</text>

            <text syncTime="1858.280" offset="7536515">The United States was not a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.888" offset="7554905">As I read the case, the knob of it, as far as the Leiter case is concerned is in the third point of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.635" offset="7593880">No relief except an injunction had been sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.883" offset="7618853">Thus, there was no other jurisdiction to be aided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.190" offset="7640168">The Leiter case is in a wholly different situation, the preliminary -- the primary, rather, jurisdiction invoked by the Government in the Leiter case is to quiet its title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.355" offset="7700773">The injunction is plainly proper within the express words of the statute as being in aid of that jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.024" offset="7735463">The petitioner argues that the in aid of its Jurisdiction Clause of 2283 was for the purpose of protecting the federal courts removal jurisdiction, and indeed it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.072" offset="7807666">The petitioner has ran pretty fast however, over the first part of the sentence in the reviser's code -- reviser's note before the word “and”, which says that this phrase was added, “To conform,” to Section 1651.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.096" offset="7871718">And what is Section 1651?</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.993" offset="7883316">It is the all writs Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.854" offset="7918738">Now, having seen that the Section 2283 is at least, in my judgment, no impediment to the power of the federal court to issue the injunction in aid of its jurisdiction, the next question is concerned with the propriety of the exercise of that power in the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.146" offset="7995956">Both courts below have decided favorably to the United States on the question, finding in unmistakable terms that if the state court proceedings were permitted to come to final judgment, dispossessing the lessees of the United States before the quiet title suit in the federal court is terminated “Both court said this, “Inestimable and irreparable damage will result to the United States from the interruptions in the operation of its lessees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.687" offset="8114134">This contingency can be avoided only by an abatement of the state court action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.414" offset="8137017">The undisputed proof in the record supports this conclusion as to the irreparability of the damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.234" offset="8160319">Now, while Mr. Marshall, representing the California Company is better or best versed than I and I want to reserve some time for him in the technical aspects of the operations of this oil field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.781" offset="8210474">And I'm sure we'll have more to say on that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.910" offset="8219042">It is clear from this record that any interruption whatsoever, even for a few hours in the operation of this field will result in a large permanent loss of recoverable oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.057" offset="8275571">Many of these wells are being produced under a so-called pressure injection method.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.895" offset="8298977">Any stoppage will cause wells to become water flooded and sand loaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.514" offset="8321442">When this case began in March of 1954, the first well having been completed as recently as January of 1950, there were already 80 producing wells and there had already been a gross production of $28 million worth of oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.210" offset="8392182">I am advised that there are now more than 90 wells and that the gross production has passed $61 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.810" offset="8422588">The permanent loss of even a momentary shut down would obviously be inestimable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.804" offset="8446621">Now, what was the eminence of this damage occurring when the United States was first advised the dependency of the case in the state court, seeking to try its title behind its back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.416" offset="8505031">The state court had already taken submission of the arguments on the exceptions of the California Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.079" offset="8535646">In federal practice we would call those exceptions a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.823" offset="8554663">And it was about to decide the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.393" offset="8564903">Indeed, the first restraining order was issued by the federal court on the last day that the California Company had to answer in the state court, after the court had overruled its exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.313" offset="8612655">If the state court had been permitted to proceed to judgment, as it could and likely would in the immediately near future the execution of a judgment for possession under Louisiana law would require that the sheriff, aided by a posse comitatus place the petitioner here in possession by force if necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.954" offset="8699173">The only alternative would be a suspensive appeal, in which a bond would be required in an amount which under Louisiana law, as to the formula for the figuring of it, might run as high as $100 million based upon the figures I have already given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.560" offset="8765628">Now, on that state of facts, what was the predicament of the United States?</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.417" offset="8797080">It could not enter the state court case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.613" offset="8809827">It had no control whatsoever over that litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.600" offset="8825814">Obviously, in properly representing the interest of the United States, there is a vast difference between cheering from the sidelines of a contest between other parties, on the one hand, and having active control as a quarterback of its own contest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.588" offset="8909720">It does not do to say that the California Company might and probably would take an appeal and post the bond.Certainly, there was no means by which the United States could either direct its action or furnish the bond for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.626" offset="8973876">I do not even know whether the mineral lessee could post such a bond and we have no way of being assured that it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.746" offset="9006373">I submit that under those circumstances, only one proper course lay open to a responsible official of the Federal Government and that happened to be me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.946" offset="9047124">And that was to protect the interest of the United States as a legal matter and as a practical matter by bringing this case in the -- for the Government to quiet its own title, and pending the determination of that case to seek to preserve the status quo and the integrity of the Government's property by an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.180" offset="9136044">In such a situation, it is idle to talk about not issuing an injunction because of a policy to avoid unseemly conflict between courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.859" offset="9174810">Indeed the denial of the injunction would only have served to promote conflict of a more aggravated sort at a latter stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.220" offset="9208247">The present injunction, timely extinguishes a spark which, otherwise, might spread into a blaze.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.075" offset="9239698">Finally, I wish to emphasize that the question here is not one which arises from a conflict of federal courts, these are the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.923" offset="9299048">Precisely, the same principles would be involved if upon some basis, Leiter had brought its action in the same federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.526" offset="9345442">The United States being disabled from entering such case voluntarily or involuntarily as a defendant for the same reasons already given would have to resort to its own separate case as plaintiff and move for a stay of the other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.719" offset="9422242">And now, may it please the Court, Mr. Marshall would conclude the arguments for the respondents, representing the California Company.</text>

            <text syncTime="2373.817" offset="9598621">Producing oil and gas wells are wasting assets and possession of such assets carries with it the power to consume and destroy them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2457.940" offset="9935182">And we would look to the United States as its mineral lessees to maintain as in feasible possession of this property, it has an obligation to do so and we would expect it to hold as harmless to -- and harmless as to any damages which we might sustain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.735" offset="9998294">I submit therefore, that the effect of this state court suit inasmuch as it reduces the property rights themselves, this loss of oil and the appropriation of oil by this petitioner, which it -- would occur there is therefore a suit directly against the property rights and interest of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.978" offset="10087320">But the state court suit is also, even in form, a suit against the United States under our law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.109" offset="10111770">All that a petitory action is in Louisiana law is a simple suit to adjudicate title brought by the party out of possession, the claimant out of possession against the defendant, who is in possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.898" offset="10162970">How long continued possession such as the United States had is the court in recognition under our law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.598" offset="10185749">We do not permit such long and continued possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.287" offset="10196511">It would be disturbed by an adverse claimant who seeks possessory relief along.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.897" offset="10218977">He has to come in with this petitory action and have it adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.481" offset="10237262">In this case, that this petitioner's title is good and that the United States title is bad or he can't achieve any possessory relief whatsoever against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.670" offset="10278013">But the dispute as to title lies not between the petitioner and the mineral lessees of the United States by the very declaration in that suit, that we are sued as mineral lessees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.458" offset="10325243">This petitioner admits that the dispute as to title is between petitioner and the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.350" offset="10352724">And that shows that even in form this suit is a suit against the Government and it brings it directly under the rule of the decisions in the Schwalby case, New Mexico versus Lane, Louisiana versus Garfield and kindred cases culminating in the Larson case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2597.951" offset="10495143">And finally, we raised the question of the statement of the claim made by the complaint in the state court, the validity of the claim which was asserted there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.876" offset="10534849">And the state court overruled all of those exceptions in an opinion holding that in effect that petitioner's claim was good and the United States claim was bad, that the United States was not an indispensable party and that the claim stated the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.595" offset="10613739">Now, the considerations that I've mentioned about the damages which would occur to the property of the United States are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.540" offset="10645504">This oil field is being operated on a gas injection method.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.107" offset="10663790">That is a procedure whereby gas is reintroduced into subsurface structure at control pressures in its selected points in this oil field in the interest of long-range maximum production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.002" offset="10731395">That is a complicated endeavor of necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.954" offset="10743202">It is based upon studies, analyses, and techniques developed by the United States mineral lessees throughout their long association with this property and in the course of drilling there, more than 80 wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.412" offset="10788968">The uncontradicted proof in this record is that whether that there'd be any transfer of control away from the mineral lessees of the United States, not even the most competent and skillful outside operator could be substituted for them without permanent and irretrievable loss, nor could there be any interruption in the production for a moment without serious loss of recoverable oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.562" offset="10885622">The proof in this record is that where the flow of oil to be interrupted from these wells as to many of them, it would never be established again and much oil that would be recoverable, would be lost forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.681" offset="10938075">In the event of any interruption, drainage would occur from one of the United States lands in favor of adjoining lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.748" offset="10966392">Moreover, oil and gas production is a hazardous business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.200" offset="10984155">Wells may blow out, go out of control or other things happen unless the most careful and prudent practices are observed in day-to-day operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.109" offset="11027832">If anyone of those things were to happen, untold damage could occur and whole segments of this reservoir be rendered worthless for all time to come.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.457" offset="11069210">Petitioner's suit in the state court proposes to visit these things upon us, to no purpose because it concedes in the brief in this Court's -- in this Court that the state court suit could not be a res judicata of the interest to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.413" offset="11125008">So, we are confronted with a temporary eviction in the state court in a case that can solve nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.714" offset="11150190">And this petitioner, as the record shows, is a corporation which was organized just prior to bringing this suit in the state court.</text>
