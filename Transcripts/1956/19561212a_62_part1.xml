            <label>Mr. George J. Moran</label>
            <text syncTime="51.630" offset="309896">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.487" offset="325360">This suit was brought pursuant to Title 46, Section 68 -- 688 of the United States Code annotated which provided or provides that any seaman who shall suffer personal injuries in the course of his employment shall have a remedy therefore if there's negligence on his employer or his fellow servants and all of the rights that railroad employees have shall extend to the seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.201" offset="480214">Now, Jacob Senko files suit in the City Court of Granite City, Illinois alleging that the defendant was the owner and the operator of a dredge called the James Wilkinson and that he was a member of the crew and a deckhand on that dredge.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.783" offset="586480">He further alleged that the dredge was plying on navigable waters of the United States on the 5th day of November in the year 1951 and that was he was injured through the negligence of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.021" offset="659414">The case was tried on res ipsa loquitur theory and trial was had and the jury rendered the verdict in the City Court in the amount of $30,000 which was reduced by remittitur to $20,000 and then judgement was entered by the Court on the verdict of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.261" offset="760456">Now, after that judgement was entered, the case was appealed to the appellate court for the Fourth District on several grounds but mainly the fact that Senko being a land lover could not be a member of the crew of a vessel and therefore as a matter of law, the jury had no right to bring in a verdict in his favor, and the appellate court reversed the judgement outright on the ground that the facts being undisputed that there was only one conclusion to draw from the facts and that was that Senko could not recover because he didn't bring himself within the definition of a member of a crew of a vessel operating on navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.073" offset="1023666">Now, the James Wilkinson operated with a crew of four.</text>

            <label>Mr. George J. Moran</label>
            <text syncTime="266.290" offset="1168488">The -- the vessel operated with a crew of four.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.782" offset="1186461">There was an engineer who operated the dredge -- who took care of the machinery on the dredge, there was an operator who operated the levers that ran the spuds and the -- and the anchors which moved the dredge above.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.948" offset="1259186">And then there was an oiler who oiled the machinery and then there was Senko, the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.692" offset="1282173">Now, all of the work that was done on the dredge and the evidence clearly shows that, which was not connected with the machinery, was done by Senko.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="305.436" stopTime="312.452">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="305.436" offset="1325119">Incidentally, is that the kind of crew, a standard set of -- type of crew for the dredge in this character?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_j_moran" startTime="312.452" stopTime="483.493">
            <label>Mr. George J. Moran</label>
            <text syncTime="312.452" offset="1353226">Well, I believe that's true, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.102" offset="1363780">I mean the -- generally the -- I imagine some dredges might have a larger crew, they all carry what we call -- what the respondent calls a laborer and we call a deckhand.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.788" offset="1414562">Now, all the elements necessary to determine whether his status was submitted to the jury by instructions tendered by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.385" offset="1464926">The defendant tendered an instruction on -- and a definition of navigable water.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.433" offset="1489063">The -- and that was given by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.420" offset="1505050">The trial court also gave a -- gave a definition of -- of a member of a crew and told the jury that he had to be a member of a crew of a vessel operating on navigable waters in order for -- in order to recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.373" offset="1564818">So, this case, after it was reversed, we filed a petition for leave to appeal with the Illinois Supreme Court, the petition for leave to appeal was denied and thereafter, we filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court and the certiorari was granted on May the 28th, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.849" offset="1658755">Now, the evidence in this case showed that for about year prior to the time of this incident that Senko was attached to the dredge, James Wilkinson, exclusively that he was a deckhand and they termed him so as a deckhand, that is his witnesses did, some of the witnesses and that the only time that he went ashore was on duties for the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.249" offset="1768364">In other words, he had certain duties on the ship but sometimes when they were dredge -- when they had this dredging operation, he would have to go to a shore to deliver lanterns or to get supplies or do those sort of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.401" offset="1816952">And in addition to that, he operated the small motor, the rowboat back and forth to the shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.290" offset="1840567">And while he was doing that, he had to wear to a lifejacket, that was government regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.433" offset="1857076">He's filled the water cooler under -- on there and he took on the supplies, took off the supplies and he cleaned up the dredge.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.002" offset="1887378">He kept the dredge shipshape and he also -- there's some testimony in there about him splicing rope.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.988" offset="1923323">And two witnesses who are in the record testified clearly that his duties were confined to the dredge and that's all the work that he did was on the dredge except when he was going off the dredge on dredge business.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.550" offset="1985599">Now, the James Wilkinson had been dredging in the canal south of Block 27 for about a year prior to the accident, in a place called Gabaret Chute or Gabaret Slough.</text>

            <label>Justice Harold Burton</label>
            <text syncTime="483.493" offset="2037321">He hadn't moved away for a year?</text>

          <turn speaker="george_j_moran" startTime="485.720" stopTime="501.117">
            <label>Mr. George J. Moran</label>
            <text syncTime="485.720" offset="2046203">Yes, he was operating right in that particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.229" offset="2060309">It was a place of about a mile from the south mouth of that canal up there and this -- it was a part of an army engineer plan to make the Mississippi river more navigable as a whole.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harold_burton" startTime="501.117" stopTime="505.749">
            <label>Justice Harold Burton</label>
            <text syncTime="501.117" offset="2107852">And the barge would move a little from time to time but stay the same area for a year?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_j_moran" startTime="505.749" stopTime="668.434">
            <label>Mr. George J. Moran</label>
            <text syncTime="505.749" offset="2126346">Well, it could -- the -- the water was 300 feet wide at that space and from the south edge of the lock down to the mouth of the -- of the channel was a mile and it was dredging out, making deeper this channel so that the -- that this area could be made more navigable.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.724" offset="2202311">The idea was that the army engineers wanted to avoid the Chain of Rocks Bridge of the Mississippi River which at certain times of the year became low and the vessels couldn't navigate up and down the river because of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.067" offset="2259675">Now, Senko at the time he testified, testified that as among his duties were taking soundings and when he took these soundings, he took soundings prior to November of 1951 and that the depth of the water when he took the soundings were from between 18 to 22 to 24 feet or right around there.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.928" offset="2351104">Another witness, William Trojan testified that at the time this happened and prior thereto he was assistant lock master and that he took soundings in August prior to the time of this happening and that from the south mouth of the canal all the way up the south gate of this lock that was almost completed, that the depth, the minimum depth was 10 feet and he also said that the water was deeper in November than it was in August.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.917" offset="2491016">So -- and there was some testimony that prior to 1951, from 1946 to 1951 that boats moved in and out of this canal up to where the dredge was and in and out of the south mouth of this canal, government boats, the supply boats, they move the concrete plant in and out of there.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.255" offset="2564368">They had built a supply dock in there in 1946 and ships and supplies in and out and that the locks, although not open to the public at that time, the locks that were being built in this Gabaret Chute or Gabaret Slough had been operated prior to November with temporary controls for a period of a week and on -- on different occasions and that they operated these when they brought some bulkheads in, they were 200 feet long with tenders to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.189" offset="2692159">And that the Wilkinson itself was floated through the south mouth of this canal when it first started this dredging operation at the south mouth of Gabaret Chute, we might say, what they were dredging out.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.103" offset="2743777">It was floated through a dredge tender.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.536" offset="2757465">Now, prior to the time that the army engineers ever came in here in 1946 --</text>

            <label>Mr. George J. Moran</label>
            <text syncTime="673.393" offset="2796962">A dredge tender, yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.864" offset="2806784">And prior to 1946, this slough had been used by public for years and years and years.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.130" offset="2843878">The slough was about four or five feet long and then practically parallel with the Mississippi River and the -- it -- it entered in -- in came into the -- left the Mississippi River at one point and joined it again at another point, it ran generally north and south.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.685" offset="2914095">And there was evidence in the record that one -- one witness, Saunders, testified that when he was a boy, 25 years ago or so, that he used to use this particular slough or chute as a shortcut in returning to home from Saint Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.120" offset="2987865">There's also testimony that there was a ferry operated across there from the mainland over to the -- over to the Gabaret Island and that they hauled horses and mules and things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.082" offset="3035721">And also that folks went across back and forth across this slough.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.850" offset="3054738">In fact, as I pointed out in my reply brief, this particular slough was made the subject of litigation over 20 years ago where a couple of horses or mules fell in there and the Court at that time, all it wanted was the navigability was involved, pointed out that the record showed that it was 300 feet wide at that time and 20 feet deep in places.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.572" offset="3133628">And another thing I think we should remember particularly in this case, we're talking about the navigability.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.623" offset="3153899">This record is replete with evidence that as the slough rose, so with the Mississippi and vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.139" offset="3183888">That the water in the Mississippi and the water in the Gabaret Slough were interchangeable and that when water in the Mississippi -- when the Mississippi was low, the slough would be row -- low or when the Mississippi was high, the slough would be high.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.893" offset="3242924">Now, the dredge was a 136 feet long, 36 feet wide, carried its own power equipment and it operated by the use of two spuds and anchors.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.801" offset="3302588">And it was on these set of facts and it's out of this evidence before them that the appellate court for the Fourth District reversed the jury's finding of fact and found that the plaintiff was not under the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.095" offset="3363715">The Court said, "This Court therefore holds as a general proposition, an employee whose principal duty is to load supplies on a vessel at anchor and to perform incidental tasks of a common laborer character and who is not primarily at work to aid in navigation cannot maintain an action under the Jones Act."</text>
            <text syncTime="839.809" offset="3462562">The Court again says further as to this particular case, it being undisputed that plaintiff lived and boarded ashore, worked the hours of a laborer, only was -- was paid only by the hour, had the primary duty of loading supplies and material on and of -- and of performing various other common labor task and who is not employed in moving the vessel from place to place and was not aboard except when the vessel was anchored that he cannot maintain an action under the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.610" offset="3585860">Further, that the provision of law making the Compensation Act the exclusively remedy of employees on vessels other than masters and members of the crew, cannot be evaded by asserting that a jury's notion of what law should be applied nullifies that provision where there is no substantial dispute as to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.273" offset="3672482">The reasoning used by the appellate court therefore makes it clear that what was behind this decision was a basic disagreement with the law that a dredge when dredging is in navigation and under maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.663" offset="3730056">For example, the Court said that the dredge had to use arms or poles or spuds to make its position more secure as the primary anchorage and it used anchorage there in a term of a ship being anchored of any other type of ship and but not in -- in terms of when its anchored that the dredge is actually doing its work.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.363" offset="3808841">They also referred to the petitioner as being a person who is only aboard when the ship is anchored.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.420" offset="3829008">Now, under this reasoning, no dredge when doing its job could be engaged in navigation and no person aboard a dredge, such as this appellate court describes, could be a seaman because under this reasoning, the dredge being in -- in anchor could not be in navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.920" offset="3907062">As we contended when we filed our petition to leave -- for relief to appeal with the Supreme Court of Illinois that this case flew into the faces of the federal law on this subject and the federal cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1009.409" offset="4141014">Yes, but they've also said that a dredge boat when operating and performing its function of dredging is navigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.313" offset="4180616">In other words, a dredge was designed to operate with two anchors and two spuds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.870" offset="4198902">The spuds are large, about 55 foot metal round objects which go down under the bed of the stream where they're navigating and the two anchors go on to the starboard and one to the port out and with these two anchors they put -- they put pressure on one anchor and one spot and they maneuver the dredge all over the stream wherever they may be dredging and in -- and -- and do that and they perform the very function for which the dredge was operated or was designed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.886" offset="4318960">Now, in the event that we say that that is not navigation, then we must say that when a dredge is performing the work for which the vessel was designed, it is not in navigation and as a far as work and as -- as far as the law is concerned, it wouldn't be a vessel such as it's contemplated to be in navigation under the -- under the maritime law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1092.654" offset="4474023">That -- we -- we say this that if the -- if the water was available for navigation and susceptible to navigation in the future, it could have made navigable by reasonable expense and effort that it would still be navigable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.403" offset="4528985">But we maintain that for a number of years prior to this that boats went in and out of there and when those boats went in and out of there, the first one, when the dredge tender floated through there that that became navigable as a matter of fact and according to even their own definition in their brief, the Daniel Ball case, if a -- if a stream water is navigable, in fact it is navigable in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.173" offset="4648103">In the Appalachian Power case, it extends the -- the definition of navigability to say that reasonable effort can be expended, then a stream is a navigable.In addition to that, we say that this water had become navigable by usage in the past and that there was and incidentally, Your Honor, this also, in our opinion, is a question of fact to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.667" offset="4754056">But it had been -- yet it's been -- had become navigable in the past by long usage and by this very reason, things have went back and forth, but this man using and people using it go back upstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.718" offset="4794284">It's historically a navigable stream, it's a tributary -- tributary to the Mississippi River which had been used in the past.And once being navigable, once it is navigable, it's presumed to be navigable in the future -- long -- as I understand the law, long continued disuse of the stream would not make it become unnavigable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.776" offset="4878503">So, we say that under the cases, Gianfala case and the cases cited therein and under the South Chicago Coal &amp; Dock case which the appellate court used to reverse this case, that this case was a question of fact for the jury that the navigability was a question of fact for the jury, that the question whether the ship was navigating was a question of fact to jury, that the question whether the man was a member or crew was a question of fact to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.778" offset="4998457">And if there was an evidentiary basis for this judgement, it should stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.643" offset="5017893">We feel that the evidence in this case was so strong that there was hardly an evidentiary basis for not holding him a member of a crew.</text>

            <text syncTime="1279.057" offset="5219558">There is a group, a company of men under the command of a master that worked together that have this as esprit de corps and who are subject to the orders of -- at anytime of day or night in order to operate and navigate the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.946" offset="5291133">The principles as to whether or not the Jones Act is applicable to a workman are decided by the cases and contained three essential elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.872" offset="5350902">Those are that the vessel be in navigation, that the worker, his duties will be are -- to be primarily in the aid of navigation and that the man must have a permanent connection with the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.518" offset="5417462">Those principles are recited in the South Chicago Coal &amp; Dock Company versus Bassett and in all of the other cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1926.203" offset="7808188">And we must bear in mind that the dredging part was only one phase of shaping the bank, use of tractors, hand tools and other things going on the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.934" offset="7855104">The Laborers' Union supplied these men, some either nine men to this particular job The union representative on the job, who was called a pusher, assigned one man to go and work, one laborer to go and work on the dredge, other men to do work in other places in the entire operation.</text>
