            <text syncTime="98.378" offset="496933">The Gianfala case scited several cases in this per curiam decision and the -- a couple of the decisions, the Wilkes versus Mississippi River Sand and Gravel Company and Gahagan Construction Company versus Armao cited there and the South Chicago Coal and Dock Company were all dredge cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.458" offset="593168">And it's interesting to note that in the South Chicago Coal and Dock Company, the Court held that -- they held in that case that they were bound by the findings of the commissioner that the man was not a crew member.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.352" offset="656802">But, they also held that was a question of fact defined and the -- the appellate court in reversing this judgment used the South Chicago Coal and Dock Company to reverse it.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.552" offset="821582">Now, in distinguishing this case, the appellate court, from the case of McKie versus Diamond Marine Company, 204 F.2d 132 and Wilkes versus Mississippi River Sand and Gravel Company, 202 F.2d, the Court said whether these cases should be regarded as close or as a encroaching on any like -- enacted legislation is immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.287" offset="920534">They do not apply to a plaintiff, employed under a union, permit to perform common labor on a local project and who's duties are to perform while the applicant is securely attached to the garment.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.302" offset="968600">The net result of this reasoning denies the benefits of the Jones Act to all man engaged in dredging and then the usual course of dredging on our ordinary dredging operations on our in bound navigable waters.</text>
