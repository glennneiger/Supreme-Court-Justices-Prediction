            <label>Mr. Theophil C.Kammholz</label>
            <text syncTime="18.475" offset="177298">The question presented in this case, if the Court please, is whether the Board has power to declare a union out of compliance upon a finding in a separate administrative proceeding that an officer of the union has filed false non-Communist affidavits and that the union membership was aware of their falsity.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.590" offset="269772">This case arose out of proceedings before the Board in which it issued its determination and order in early 1955 to the effect that the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers was out of compliance with the 9 (h) because one Maurice Travis, Secretary-Treasurer of the organization, had filed -- excuse me -- affidavits which were false and that the membership was aware of such falsity.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.302" offset="400593">By way of background, the record shows that commencing in 1949, Travis and other officers of the union had filed affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.346" offset="436746">The Board had presumed them to be true and had held the union in compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.330" offset="468720">In 1953, in an unfair labor practice proceeding in Chicago involving prior to Scientific Precision -- involving Precision Scientific and the refusal to bargain charge against that company, the respondent company asserted among other things that at the time Travis filed his initial 1949 affidavit, he had stated publicly and there had been released in the union publication at that time a statement to the effect that he had resigned from the Communist Party solely in order that he might be able to execute the affidavits required under the Taft-Hartley law but that he nevertheless continued to adhere to the principles of communism and the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.092" offset="695777">The Board then is now treating questions of compliance for its administrative determination and not for litigation in a representation or an unfair labor practice case, thereupon issued an order directing an administrative hearing on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.004" offset="787414">Specifically, it directed that the hearing be held before a Board hearing officer for the purpose of receiving evidence on two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.193" offset="824195">First, whether Travis in fact had admitted that the affidavits which he had filed with the Board pursuant to 9 (h) were false, and secondly, whether the membership of the union was aware of such falsity.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.608" offset="885844">The -- the order also provided for opportunity for oral argument in filing the briefs with the Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="573.807" offset="2398647">Thereupon, a suit was commenced by the union in the District Court for the District of Columbia contending inter alia that the Board's determination was beyond its powers under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.274" offset="2456430">In that proceeding, Precision Scientific intervened and alleged among other things that the union in fact was not a labor organization and that it was in Court with unclean hands, and therefore, ought to be denied injunctive relief for which it craved.</text>

            <text syncTime="680.776" offset="2826428">The Court's position of course implies that the Board function with reference to non-Communist affidavits is purely a ministerial one, that it has no right or authority to look behind the paper to inquire into truth or falsity, that it must accept affidavits even though they concededly be false as counsel Harwood suggested in the prior argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.538" offset="2937501">It is the Board position that both apart from and under the language of 9 (h), the Board possesses implied power to protect its processes from abuse and this is confirmed by the legislative history and the scheme of the statute with particular reference to these filing requirements in the purpose of the Congress in providing for non-Communist affidavits under the Act, witness the Highland Park language.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.536" offset="3069471">I should like at this point to document briefly the history of what the Board has done on this subject in response to your previous inquiry, Mr. Chief Justice Warren.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.606" offset="3125791">At the outset, the Board established an affidavit compliance section.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.699" offset="3154213">It took the position that the question of truth or falsity was for the Department of Justice and that if evidence came to it of false swearing, those matters should be referred to the Department of Justice for such action as it might deem appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.470" offset="3225266">Shortly afterwards, however, in connection with its administration of the Act, it became apparent that certain other rules of the game would need to be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.654" offset="3266017">The problem arose first in connection with the so-called fronting by another labor organization or by an individual on behalf of a labor organization not in compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.897" offset="3314918">And the Board early held that where a fronting situation existed, it was entitled to look into the true facts of the situation and was empowered to dismiss a charge and refuse to proceed on a complaint if a front was presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.263" offset="3408436">Subsequently, and I -- this occurred in early 19 -- in late 1952, the first conviction under a false 9 (h) affidavit occurred in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.981" offset="3507284">The union officer was Valenti, an official of the United Packinghouse Workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.062" offset="3531630">About that same time, a grand jury had been convened in New York and it inquired specifically into the veracity of a number of 9 (h) affidavits filed by officers of other unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.624" offset="3593906">The grand jury issued a presentment, which was transmitted to the Board by Judge Weinfeld asserting that these officers, including Gold, had declined before the grand jury to acknowledge that the affidavits they have previously filed were truthful, that this was a proper matter for Board inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.933" offset="3667153">Not long -- long afterwards in 1953, the Senate Subcommittee, to which I made previous reference, rendered its report in which it asserted that in questions involving falsity, the Board did have the right to look behind and was not obligated to rely on a precarious affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.018" offset="3771434">Thereupon, the Board first issued an administrative order reciting the facts set forth in this presentment and requiring that a hearing be had to determine the facts.</text>

            <label>Mr. Nathan Witt</label>
            <text syncTime="1597.181" offset="6492139">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.058" offset="6503633">Since Mr. Cammer and Mr. Kammholz have discussed the legislative history, they went into the 1947 statute, and also in light of the questions put by the members of the Court particularly to Mr. Kammholz, I'd like to say a few words about the statute which was passed in 1954 subsequent to some of this history which Mr. Kammholz was just telling you about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.006" offset="6647411">In August 1954, the Communist Control Act of 1954 was enacted, being an amendment to the Internal Security Act of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.716" offset="6722226">In the Communist Control Act of 1954, Congress defined a new type of Communist organization in addition to those which had been defined in the 1950 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.646" offset="6789935">And the new definition pertained to "Communist-infiltrated organizations," being an additional category to so-called Communist action and Communist-front organizations in the 1950 Act with which Your Honors of course are thoroughly familiar from the Communist Party case involving the Subversive Activities Control Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.882" offset="6894947">And in the same way that Congress entrusted the -- the determination of the type of organization involved in the 1950 Act through the Subversive Activities Control Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.395" offset="6973001">It entrusted the determination of Communist-infiltrated organizations to the Subversive Activities Control Board and the Act of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.283" offset="7024515">And it did so of course with some slight variations not now material, certainly not material to this case, with the same procedure for administrative determination and judicial review as had been made in the 1950 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.790" offset="7110510">So, at least in that Act, whatever else we might say about it in an appropriate proceeding, at least in -- that Act does not have the serious defects, constitutional as well -- well as other defects which we complain about with respect to what the NLRB has attempted to do in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.021" offset="7215417">But aside from that and without getting into -- into the details about the 1954 Act, there are two points that will be -- that ought to be made about it which have considerable elements to the issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.259" offset="7296397">The first is actually an answer to the argument which Mr. Kammholz makes about -- on which the Board makes in its brief about these developments which began with the conviction of Valenti, the first conviction under Section 1001 for having filed a false affidavit pursuant to Section 9 (h), a conviction not in New York but in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.347" offset="7392737">Late in 1952, a few months after Chairman Herzog's testimony in March of 1952, and the Board in its brief, and Mr. Kammholz touched on these developments in his argument, relates the other developments from 19 -- the end of 1952, the one -- Valenti conviction into the time in 1953 when it began its first effort to assert upon what should -- therefore said and said over and over again, not only the committees of Congress but in case after case that Congress had not entrusted to it in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.498" offset="7585416">So that, just about the same time when Mr. Kammholz tells us that these developments who come into ahead in quoting the report of the Subcommittee of the Senate Labor Committee, headed by Senator Humphrey, the Congress took steps to deal with the problem in a normal way by passing legislation about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.803" offset="7710595">The second point to be made about the Communist Control Act of 1954 is that unlike the consequences which fall from a -- from determinations under the 1950 Act legislation enabling all the rest of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.495" offset="7793351">As far as the 1954 Act is concerned, be waiting for communist-infiltrated organizations including labor organizations and there is no question that the -- that the 1954 Act was directed principally at labor organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.070" offset="7863672">The principal sanction, the only sanction to speak off in the 1954 Act is what in this case we call decompliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.659" offset="7914036">It's not called that in the 1954 Act, but the 1954 Act provides that once an order becomes final, not of course after determination by the SACB but after judicial review, final order being defined in the same way as it's defined in 1950 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.692" offset="7994180">The 1954 Act provides that a union loses, the union found to be Communist infiltrated, loses its status before the NLRB and in fact goes further and loses its status as a bargaining representative generally and that's -- all of its contracts have opened to petitions filed by liable unions before the Board, etcetera, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.437" offset="8101073">So, we say about this that the very clear history which we derive from the time the -- the bill, which became the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947 was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.668" offset="8182053">We say the very clear history which runs in our direction in this case is reinforced by Congress, was reinforced by Congress in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.933" offset="8223117">And if Mr. Kammholz is right in -- in saying that these developments beginning at the end of 1952 were pertinent, then the conclusion really is that what happened was that Congress set up machinery to deal with the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.185" offset="8308067">Therefore, if there was any doubt before August 1954 about this power which the Board to say, we say there no longer is any doubt.</text>

            <text syncTime="2150.726" offset="8706278">But the Board also argues that Congress continue to be concerned with Communist domination or Communist control or Communist infiltration of labor organizations despite the passage of Section 9 (h) and that's why the Board is asserting the power that's asserted in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2187.194" offset="8852146">No, it doesn't in that sense, Mr. Justice Black, but in arguing that an interpretation should be put on the legislative history of the 1947 Act, the Board argues that this history of continued Communist influence or control or domination, supports the -- the power that the Board is asserting as a result of the 1947 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.957" offset="8975235">And we say that by passing the 1954 Act, the Congress set up a mechanism for dealing with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.193" offset="9000103">And in addition, if the Congress had wanted to give this Board the power, the whole problem having been discussed for sometime before that is illustrated by Chairman Herzog's testimony in March 1952, and the whole problem had been thoroughly discussed before the Humphrey Subcommittee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.155" offset="9084008">It would have done so in -- in codifying or disposing of this entire problem in the Act, which it passed in August 1954.</text>

            <text syncTime="2274.503" offset="9201351">Well, without now arguing number 40, Your Honor, that quote from Chairman Herzog has a reference to a conviction, conviction of an affiant, the way union officer would file an affidavit, and that's not our case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.003" offset="9315349">As a second reason why the Board's action in this case was improper, not only -- not only does the National Labor Relations Act of course provide that the Board may enact rules and regulations, but the Administrative Procedure Act requires that it sets out provisions for rule making by administrative agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.798" offset="9462575">And I have particular reference to Sections 2 (c) and 4 of the APA, Section 2 (c) providing for rule making and Section 4, providing for giving a notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.703" offset="9522134">And we say that in this case, the power which the Board asserts to decomply unions as a result of allegedly false affidavits filed by their officers is a power which can be asserted only after the proposal of the rules as pursuant to Section 2 (c) of the APA and notice and hearing as spelled out in Section 4 of APA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.037" offset="9655568">Now, this case illustrates, it's a vivid illustration of what happens when those provisions not complied with and illustrates at least one of the good reasons, which went into the enactment of APA particularly in light of the fact that for five years after 1947, the Board had not asserted this power that came as a complete suffice when it asserted it for the first time in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.035" offset="9791509">And the history of the Lannom case and the history of this case demonstrates that there is no way of knowing, neither officers and certainly not members of labor unions, have any ways of knowing on what basis the Board will act in its efforts to decomply unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.881" offset="9886908">But in any event, we -- we say that on the face of these provisions in APA, the Board's action in this case was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.681" offset="9934137">Now, I'd like to conclude with a few words about the facts in this case, which will illustrate -- which will illustrate the administrative impossibility or rather the enormous difficulties and confusions which are created or which would be created if the Board were given this power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.764" offset="10090454">Now, Mr. Kammholz told you that in his statement in 1949, Mr. Travis stated, and I'm trying to quote Mr. Kammholz, that he still adhered to the principles of communism and the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.274" offset="10176449">Now, nowhere in that statement will you find any remark or statement by Mr. Travis that he still adheres to the principles of the Communist Party and you certainly won't find it in the extract from that statement that Mr. Kammholz read to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.481" offset="10269341">Now, this illustrates what happened in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.176" offset="10300061">The Board did not find after its administrative hearing that Travis had admitted that at the time he signed his first affidavit in August 1949, he was a member of the Communist Party or affiliated with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.076" offset="10387728">What the Board found in rather general language mostly was that he had admitted that the affidavit was false, and when the Board became specific about it in its decision and order of February 1st 1955 that referred to his continued belief in communism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.001" offset="10487411">Now, getting back to a question that you asked, Mr. Chief Justice, Section 9 (h) has nothing to do with a belief in communism and the quotation or the part of Mr. Travis' statement that Mr. Kammholz read to you has nothing to do with Section 9 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.260" offset="10564420">Section 9 (h) requires the affiant to swear that he's not a member of the Communist Party, not affiliated with it, nor that he is a member of -- or that he believes in or supports any organization which believes in forcible advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.459" offset="10669223">And Mr. Kammholz in his argument and the Board in its brief is very careful or very careful to stay away from being specific, and of course they did it also and the order passed -- the decision and order passed in February 1955, being specific about what clause of that provision of Section 9 (h) Travis falsified and what clause he had -- he was admitted in August 1949 that he falsified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.563" offset="10809657">At most, he stated as Mr. Kammholz argued that he believed in the principles of communism which to him meant struggle for better life and what the trade union movement meant to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.838" offset="10858768">Mr. Kammholz then go on to the -- to another section of that statement in which Mr. Travis said that he had never believed in force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.841" offset="10902758">That if he had the opinion that the Communist Party believed their advocated force and violence, he would never have joined it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.158" offset="10939956">So that in a statement, he expressively rejected any notion that -- that the statement expressly rejects any notion that he was lying about the belief provision which incidentally has never been passed on by this Court anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.826" offset="11010696">It's left opened in the Douds and Osman cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.403" offset="11032952">So that here, we get an illustration of what happens when an administration asserts -- an administrative agency asserts an implied power which pass no limits which permits it to -- to conduct what it calls a hearing, an administrative hearing instead of the criminal proceeding with all the safeguards provided by Section 1001 which Congress said is specifically applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.975" offset="11155310">And to this date having -- even though I lived with this case ever since the Board issued its original order in February 1954, I'm still not certain as to what the Board said Travis admitted in that statement in August 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.117" offset="11243813">Secondly, and I won't spend any time on this point because it was discussed somewhat in the other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.018" offset="11283414">The Board went on to find that since he his admitted that as 1949 affidavit was false, not only was the 1950 affidavit false.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.066" offset="11335659">It goes much further than the Amalgamated case in that respect but that all of the affidavits he has filed until 1953, a total of seven affidavits, six subsequent to the one filed in August 1949 were also false.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.334" offset="11416743">So that if what the Board has found in -- in the Amalgamated case as -- as extreme, it's difficult to characterize what the Board has done in this case appropriately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.726" offset="11470242">Then beyond that, in this case, the Board asserts the power to decomply the union not only because Travis admitted the falsity or I should say in addition that the order that the Board passed in February 1955, not only decomply the union as far as the period from August 1949 to November 1953 was concerned, but also decomplied the union with respect to an affidavit which was filed after the administrative hearing had been completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.690" offset="11626141">So that the Board refused to give effect to an affidavit filed by Travis in October 1954 which came between the time the Board issued its order starting a proceeding and the time it issued its final order decomplying the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.855" offset="11702836">So that if there's any question as to whether we had a hearing on the six affidavits filed between August 1949 and November 1953, there's no question but that we never had a hearing on the October 1954 affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.253" offset="11772426">Now, coming to the question of membership, I wanted to ask especially in view of the limits on my time, I -- I -- all I think I may do to begin with as to remind, Your Honors, of Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question to Mr. Kammholz as to how many members of this union of 100,000 American workers were aware not only of the falsity of Travis' affidavit in August 1949, but were aware of the falsity of his six or seven -- take your choice, affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.516" offset="11929475">And the Board of course has never spelled that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.810" offset="11942640">We don't know whether the Board's finding that the membership was aware of the falsity just taking not only the August 1949 affidavit, but the Board's concluding finding that the membership was aware.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.065" offset="11991646">That means all 100,000 members in August 1949 and whether the different 100,000 in -- in December 1951 or the different 100,000 in December 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.209" offset="12056221">The shifting nature of union membership of course is well known.</text>

            <text syncTime="3124.754" offset="12602389">The effect -- the effect of decomplying this union in February 1955 if the decompliance had been valid on the statute constitutionally, would have been to so open to question -- not so open to question, but in effect to invalidate not only as a labor board proceeding since August 1949, but as a collective agreement which this union had made with the copper companies, invested in non-ferrous metal industry and as well as all of its local unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.208" offset="12780231">In this connection, I advert back to the Act of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.253" offset="12816384">That Act does not operate retroactively the way the Board's asserted power in this case would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.946" offset="12847208">It acts prospectively so that the union is not out of compliance or doesn't lose its status as a labor organization until the order of the SACP is final, and avoids this disastrous consequence even if you overlook shooting the shotguns into the ranks of 100,000 workers as put in the court below if you impose the penalty of decompliance on the members of the union because an officer has been adjudged injurious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.980" offset="12991300">Certainly, in light of the basic philosophy of the Wagner Act and the Taft-Hartley Act, it's a point to think of the consequences of saying that all of this union's agreements with the big copper companies are now open for grabs and everything we've been doing these last few years under these agreements have been implied.</text>

            <text syncTime="3253.595" offset="13117733">First, it is our view that the Administrative Procedures Act has no bearing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.571" offset="13141661">This is not a question of rule making, it's an adjudicatory question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.789" offset="13162559">Secondly, on the subject of the Communist Control Act of 1954, we deal with it in a footnote at page 39 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.211" offset="13204250">Suffice it to say here, I think that Act did not purport to repeal the provisions of 9 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.569" offset="13233612">It deals with a broader subject and consequently, we submit has no application to the question before the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3292.125" offset="13271855">Mr. Kammholz, Mr. Herzog as such (Inaudible) in this field has -- I looked at his testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="3311.282" offset="13348551">But I can't read the light -- I noticed his testimony leaves (Inaudible) on -- developed the light in (Inaudible) because on page 53 of the testimony he says, “It is my recollection of what happened was -- he means a procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.380" offset="13420857">It's my recollection of what happened was that if a party raise such a question in a case, we said it was not litigable before the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3352.437" offset="13513122">But later on, he says on the next page, “If there was a conviction of perjury."</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.266" offset="13544469">"Yes, I would."</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.912" offset="13551052">Mr. Herzog, "An affidavit, if it is perjurious, certainly should not be regarded as a valid affidavit so that in that -- both argument, the testimony on the one hand that -- that in the distribution of -- of enforcement function, this was simply to state it in the Department of Justice, on the other hand, the perjurious affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.499" offset="13641331">There's no affidavit that we can think of that -- or I should think that disqualified that effect from the real problem in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.116" offset="13671842">Who is to decide or what is the procedure for determining whether the -- the jury says a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.347" offset="13696711">If you -- if you by any chance (Inaudible) there's no testimony, it couldn't do it.</text>
