            <text syncTime="13.276" offset="156505">On yesterday, may it please the Court, we considered and sketched briefly the Louisiana Public Service Commission, its powers, its duties and its obligations and compared them on parallel courses as far as practical with the functions of the S. E. C.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.359" offset="240828">We also discussed the right of judicial review of any order made under subsection 11 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.770" offset="286490">Today, I should like to discuss the merits of the case with particular reference to the Louisiana Public Service Commission, applying the principles of Section 11, subsection 1 (a), (b) and (c) of the Act because we feel that the objectives, the obligations and duties of that Commission do not conflict with those of the S. E. C.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.953" offset="439150">That their orbits of influence need not necessarily clash, that the Congress when it enacted the Public Utility Holding Company Act and particularly when it inserted the proviso which I shall read in a moment in Section 11 (b) (1), that it intended to take care of a situation exactly such as we described on the merits of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.693" offset="546147">And so it is our feeling that a reasonable interpretation of the provisions of the Act would bring the same conclusion here, we hope, that the Fifth Circuit thought was justified under the provisions of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="645.239" offset="2684322">Section 11 (b), I will paraphrase or not repeat all of the words of the first subsection 1, but when I get the proviso, I'll read every word that it shall be the duty of the Commission to require by order that each registered holding company shall take such action as the Commission shall find necessary to limit its operations to a single integrated public utility system."</text>
            <text syncTime="671.870" offset="2790902">Now, provided -- I have skipped several words there, but I don't think they're pertinent particularly, provided, however, that the Commission shall permit a registered holding company to continue to control one or more additional integrated public utility systems if after notice and opportunity to -- for a hearing it finds that (a), each of such additional systems cannot be operated as an independent system without the loss of substantial economies which can be secured by the retention of control by such holding company of such system.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.553" offset="2953592">And then the (b) and (c) provisions, I don't believe are -- are at issue here but they are interesting to see whether or not we are -- we fit with them and (b) states that all of such additional systems are located in one state or in an adjoining states or in a contiguous foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.181" offset="3020048">The Louisiana Power System is entirely located within the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.499" offset="3037393">The (c) provision states that the contingent combination of such systems under the control of the holding company, I skipped a few words, is not so large as to impair the advantages of localized management, efficient operation or the effectiveness of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.479" offset="3101236">Now, may it please the Court, the proviso in the Act somewhat softened the impact of the directive to the S. E. C. which Congress had passed in this particular Act and there was a reason for that, there had been a disagreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.433" offset="3177096">The legislative history shows there had been a disagreement between the Senate and the House as to what the provisions of the Act should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.017" offset="3215444">The Senate passed a version.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.356" offset="3220773">The House passed a version with amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.226" offset="3232266">The amendments were not concurred in by the Senate and it was necessary that the matter go to conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.823" offset="3254627">And after the conference, there was an attempt made in the House to adopt the Conference Report which in effect would adopt the Senate bill which did not have this proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.144" offset="3291930">That -- the House rejected the agreement to -- to the Conference Report and another Conference Report was prepared which contains the provisions which are now in the Act and which we are adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.752" offset="3338428">Now, the Conference Report of the House, which I find on page 20 of the Louisiana Power's brief and I will borrow that paragraph from their brief makes this significant statement, "The conference substitute meets the House's desire to provide for a further flexibility by the statement of additional definite and concrete circumstances under which exception should be made to the form of one integrated system."</text>
            <text syncTime="838.089" offset="3455770">I ask Your Honors to note the word “flexibility” and that was what the proviso was designed to do and that's what we think it did do.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.516" offset="3489416">“Definite exceptions not only provide a satisfactory constitutional standard but also an effective standard for the guidance of both the Securities and Exchange Commission and those holding companies which wished voluntary -- voluntarily to comply with congressional policy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="864.401" offset="3560991">It's the end of the quotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.116" offset="3571858">So we -- we think that the proviso as a matter of fact one of the Circuit Judges said, I think, perhaps on a dissenting opinion that the Act would not have passed had the proviso not been inserted in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.392" offset="3628910">And I think we may imply that from the legislative history because of the failure of the first Conference Report, they have been concurred in by the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.105" offset="3663809">So I think we may fairly say that this Public Utility Holding Company Act would not have passed had this proviso not been inserted in it.</text>

            <text syncTime="935.502" offset="3845413">No, I don't think it's unreasonable but I again say that I'm not seeking that interpretation here.</text>

            <text syncTime="958.022" offset="3935483">But I have in sketching the background of the Act upon yesterday, attempted to show Your Honors that Congress in passing the Act felt that -- that the word of the State Commission under certain circumstances was very vital.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.197" offset="3992116">In fact, they wouldn't give approval of certain types of transactions without State Commission approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.733" offset="4014268">Now, that is purely an analogy, I agree and I'm just trying to -- to bring it by analogy but for any person, Mr. Chief Justice, I wouldn't -- I say it's susceptible to that construction but I don't ask for it here, I ask only that you hold that this Commission can come in and do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.033" offset="4095457">Now, the offer of proof which the Louisiana Commission filed stated that it had exercised jurisdiction over the retail electric and gas rates of this company of -- for residential, commercial and so forth uses that the Commission requires Louisiana Power to file annual reports that it had fixed the electric rate base of Louisiana Power back in 1946, had prescribed its allowable rate of return, that its electric -- at Louisiana Power's electric accounts are classified on the uniform systems of accounts as or the gas accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.127" offset="4251878">And then in the offer of proof, Louisiana Commission used the language of the (a), (b), (c) provisions of the proviso which I have just read and alleged that the facts would say -- would show in the offer of proof, fitted into those particular provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.872" offset="4314885">And it said that there is no law of the State of Louisiana which prohibits the ownership by utility of both an electric and gas system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.905" offset="4346964">That Louisiana Power has the express approval of the Louisiana Commission to have both an electric and gas system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.358" offset="4376848">That the public interest would best be served by the continued operation of Louisiana Power of both in electric and gas system and it supported that by a letter from the Governor of the State and by letters from the officials of 28 of the 30 towns and cities which this company serves and 14 of the 15 parishes or counties which are involved in this particular system, which are covered and embraced in this particular system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.540" offset="4497533">It further supported its offer of proof by a separation study, a detail separation study which you will find in the record at pages -- beginning at page 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.284" offset="4544554">And it showed that the total additional cost to consumers and customers of Louisiana Power would be $957,000 a year of which $684,000 would be lost to the electric system and $272,000 would be lost to the gas system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.214" offset="4624280">The separation study was -- was made by taking the operations of this company for 1954 and extracting from the electric system of accounts all charges that had heretofore the -- extracting from the books, I'd better say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.578" offset="4689690">Those charges which had heretofore been made for the gas system and set -- setting up and projecting two separate corporations just as if they had operated separately on that particular year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.548" offset="4729605">And it was natural that there should be and the -- the loss of $957,000 came from the fact that you were going to have two overhead cost where you had one before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.614" offset="4781850">And because of the fact that this particular company's gas, customers are largely also its electric customers there's going to be a duplication of activity, duplication of billing, of reading the meters, of -- duplication of administrative officers and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.119" offset="4839842">And the total that's shown in the record here, the exact amount is actually computed by the Louisiana Commission's own staff and it comes out to what Louisiana Commission considered a very large sum of money which would be lost to customers of Louisiana Power by divestiture of the gas system in a separation of the gas system from the electric system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1202.776" offset="4914448">Mr. Ainsworth, is there anything in the record which would indicate why the utility itself did not take an appeal or was not the moving party in this situation?</text>

            <text syncTime="1218.117" offset="4975888">I don't -- there is nothing in the record on that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.109" offset="4995845">Now, another thing that was brought in the offer of proof was that under the peculiar facts and circumstances and based somewhat upon the climatic conditions of the State of Louisiana that been -- that the gas and electric systems tended to compliment each other, that in the summer you had a higher use of electricity, in the winter you had a higher use of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.442" offset="5077138">And there's an exhibit in this record that shows that by combining the two on six months basis beginning in November through April and from May through October that they balanced out the total revenues from the two systems, averaged out about 50% each time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.506" offset="5141400">So that the company, by virtue of having the two systems, tended to have a complete operation from the very nature of things inherent in the operation of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.658" offset="5182046">Louisiana Commission said that it -- in it's offer of proof that it had -- had long experience with this utility, that it believed it to be an efficient operation, that it had found its regulation in Louisiana Power to be most effective that that company had never had been given a rate increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.533" offset="5261458">On the other hand, it had given electric rate reductions that the only gas increase that had ever occurred was one equal to the amount of the increase in the wholesale cost of gas to this particular company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.019" offset="5311404">And so, on the basis and on the predicate of -- and I have skimmed through it only very briefly, they held the Louisiana Commission felt that the facts justified a holding that giving a reasonable interpretation to the Section 11 (b) (1), particular Clause (a), that the loss of economies was a substantial one, the Courts have held that substantial means important economies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.137" offset="5427911">That's the Circuit -- the Second Circuit held that, the Fifth Circuit held it in our own case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.320" offset="5448704">We say substantial is a relative and an elastic term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.319" offset="5464691">The S. E. C. interprets substantial to mean that the losses must be so great that the severed system, here the gas system, could not continue to operate independently, economically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.746" offset="5510353">Now, we say that that conclusion is simply not justified by the language of the statute and that is an erroneous interpretation and it -- it confines this proviso so tight that it would be practically impossible to fit within it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.689" offset="5574092">In other words, that it has the effect of nullifying the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.304" offset="5588616">We also say that the loss of substantial economies should relate not only to the severed system, the gas system, but also to the principal system, the electric system, that it would be blinding one's eyes to reality as the brief of the Louisiana Commission says when it -- which was submitted to the S. E. C.</text>

            <text syncTime="1417.203" offset="5772204">Well, actually, may it please the Court, there are a number of things shown in the offer of proof whether you consider them substantial changes in circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.487" offset="5809298">That's why a moment ago when you asked me the question, I didn't want to confine it only to that, I also feel that we have to go back to the conditions that existed at the time the original order was issued which were based upon erroneous legal interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.317" offset="5856632">But to answer your question more directly, the order was issued in 1953, the early order, the separation study was based on facts and circumstances in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.994" offset="5903339">Since the order of 1953 had been issued, it had been possible to find out that the -- the severed or gas system would have to pay a larger amount for a debt service because Louisiana Power had actually gone into the market and sought that financing for the company that was to be set up to take over the gas system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.862" offset="5974810">That in addition to that the Louisiana Commission had the benefit of the studies of the operations of the Arkansas Power &amp; Light Company and the Mississippi Power &amp; Light Company which has severed their gas systems to show what the increase cost had been to those companies or no longer being able to allocate part of their overhead expenses to gas system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.629" offset="6057880">And the -- the running of time was necessary in order to have that information before the Commission, it could not have been obtained, it could not have been submitted to the S. E. C. at the time because those systems had only then been severed and it -- the information wasn't then available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.235" offset="6116289">So we put it on two premises as the Fifth Circuit said that it could -- that the Court could examine the conditions that truly prevailed at the time the original order was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.808" offset="6170624">We ask Your Honors to consider these legal interpretations which the S. E. C. has given, which we respectfully suggest are erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.542" offset="6201553">We ask you also to examine the offer of proof and decide whether or not in your exercise of judicial authority and discretion, whether or not the facts and circumstances which were shown subsequent to the time of the March 20, 1953 order justify the allegation which you find in the supplemental petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.703" offset="6274173">That's our case, we stand or fall on it, if Your Honors please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.770" offset="6290474">And we are anxious that the Louisiana Commission to have the opportunity of cooperating and working with the S. E. C., but we can see no compensating advantages which accrue from the separation of this gas system in Louisiana, it's contrary to the state policy and we feel that if haven't -- if -- if given the opportunity on a remand to go back to the S. E. C., we would hope to persuade our brothers there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2199.270" offset="8900420">Mr. Justice Douglas asked whether it was registered, yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.020" offset="8919437">It's not registered because it is not a holding company but it is a subsidiary of a registered holding company and as such is subject to the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2236.046" offset="9047542">Now, that was one of the considerations in writing the Holding Company Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2266.016" offset="9167391">Now, we submit, if Your Honor please, that on the state of the record in this case, it must be assumed that if this separation is or complied with that there will be a loss of $957,000, a minimum of that -- a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.198" offset="9264149">That there will be a additional cost to a separated gas properties in the form of a higher interest rate, it was estimated by the Commission at approximately $28,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.489" offset="9321305">Also there will be loss, the other advantages of combined operation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2331.409" offset="9429034">Now, this seems to be admittedly a highly undesirable result and therefore in approaching the interpretation of Section 11 (b) (1) (a), we ask ourselves does that -- do those words require this result?</text>
