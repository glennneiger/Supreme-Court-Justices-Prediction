            <text syncTime="46.631" offset="289938">When Mr. Justice Douglas wrote the prevailing opinion in the now famous case of Estin against Estin, the last sentence in that prevailing opinion read as follows, "And it will be time enough to consider the effect of any discrimination shown to out of state ex parte divorces when a state makes that its policy."</text>
            <text syncTime="84.215" offset="440195">I don't think that even Mr. Justice Douglas had the faintest idea of what was going to happen to the legislative policy of New York after writing that opinion in Estin against Estin.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.008" offset="499440">But shortly thereafter, attempts were made to introduce statutes into the New York legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.028" offset="539460">And finally, one was passed effective April 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.650" offset="573942">The Court has been supplied with the pamphlet of the Law Revision Commission, Legislative Document Number 65 (k), which accompanied the proposed statute, which is now for consideration before this Court in view of the particular circumstances of this case I may say.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.379" offset="688880">And in that pamphlet, I'd like to read just two sentences to call to the direct attention of the Court, the background before I recite the most important facts, which are to be considered by the Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sol A. Rosenblatt</label>
            <text syncTime="200.241" offset="904338">I'll see that you certainly have them sir, if you haven't already been given.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.737" offset="922311">At page 5 of this recommendation and the top reads, "Recommendation to the Law Revision Commission to the legislature relating to the jurisdiction to the Supreme Court, that's of New York, to grant maintenance to a wife not withstanding a judgment of divorce, annulment or nullity of marriage of a court which did not have personal jurisdiction overheard."</text>
            <text syncTime="232.344" offset="1032756">And in the second paragraph, the Commission says, "The Estin case called the attention to the injustice to a New York wife whose husband has obtained the divorce in another state in an ex parte proceeding."</text>
            <text syncTime="252.372" offset="1112900">And thereafter, immediately before the recommendation of the specific statute, which will be found in the petitioner's brief at page -- I think 4 or 5 -- page 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.225" offset="1232227">The Commission says the following, "The Commission believes that legislation is necessary to protect the New York wife who's right to support from her husband may now be completely cut off by an ex parte foreign divorce decree in the absence of a previous New York separation decree with provision for maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.070" offset="1323656">In order to avoid discrimination against foreign divorces, against which the Estin opinion warned, such legislation should be made applicable whether the husband's ex parte adjudication of marital status was obtained in a foreign court or a New York Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.553" offset="1421563">What wonderful language and I'll proceed to take it apart, because as applied in this case where there was no New York wife and there was no New York husband, my contention is that this statute is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.757" offset="1562415">It violates particularly Article 4 Section 2 of the Constitution and is in complete disagreement with every concept, when I was taught years ago, constituted the elements of due process of law and I think I can make that clear on the statement of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.249" offset="1688325">In 1948, a fellow named Vanderbilt had been a resident, a legal resident, a domiciliary of the State of Nevada since 1928.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.199" offset="1768155">That's 20 years previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.310" offset="1780590">During all that period of time, that was his domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.747" offset="1790412">That is his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.309" offset="1808593">And in 1948 of September, the lady who he married in the State of Connecticut was admittedly domiciled herself in the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.415" offset="1877034">So, when this two got married in the State of Connecticut in September of 1948, they continued in their marital relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.299" offset="1936593">Sooner or later, left the matrimonial domicile of Nevada and became domiciliaries of the State of California where they voted, where they paid taxes, in the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.813" offset="2006601">And in September of 1952, they parted.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.769" offset="2038471">They were then both residents of the State of California in September 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.333" offset="2072743">But this lady, in an action which is very important for the Court to understand but which is not -- this particular action but between these two parties, this lady sat in Los Angeles and verified a complaint in the Supreme Court of New York County where she cause Mr. Vanderbilt to be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.317" offset="2176606">He hadn't just gotten off a boat from Europe, and she claimed that she was entitled to a separation, alimony, counsel fees, and she swore from that complaint that she and Mr. Vanderbilt, her husband, were residents of the State of New York, domiciliaries of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.093" offset="2291754">Because if she hadn't said that they were residents of the State of New York, she couldn't have issued any process to have him served in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.758" offset="2334386">You cannot bring a matrimonial action of any kind, nature or description in New York State unless there is a specific allegation in the complaint that the parties are legal residents of the State of New York.</text>
