            <text syncTime="33.185" offset="236126">This is an issue which is present in the much power of the greatest majority of these cases and which, at least, in certain aspects, there is a conflict of the circuits.</text>

            <text syncTime="150.289" offset="704554">That is our -- our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.444" offset="713122">Now, if the burden of coming forward of -- with some proof, some prima facie evidence of duress rest on the claimant to citizenship, what is enough is the fact that he was drafted, that he was conscripted, is that enough?</text>
            <text syncTime="166.494" offset="769337">Now on that issue, there is a conflict of circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.140" offset="779891">The court below and we believe the District of Columbia Circuit and perhaps some others have said that mere proof of subscription of conscription is not enough to carry his burden of coming forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.439" offset="825135">As we read the Second and Third Circuits decisions, they have said it is enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.593" offset="841749">On that issue, all I would like to add to what has been said is to point out that this Court in the two cases, the Murata and Okimura case, which it had here about four or five years ago, we think we solved that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.888" offset="894934">In those two cases, Judge Mclaughlin in Hawaii had invalidated the statutes providing for expatriation for serving on a foreign army and the Japanese Army in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.004" offset="935372">The cases came here on that constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.999" offset="947388">The Court did not decide the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.444" offset="957106">It vacated the –- of the judgment of the court below remanded the case, both cases for consideration by the trial court of the issue of duress pointing out that all the circumstances should be shown and inferences draw therefrom.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.271" offset="1016456">The point I wish to make here is that if conscription alone were enough, the Court would have affirmed the judgment below because on the records which came to this Court, it was undisputed that both of those petitioners had been conscripted, had been grafted into the Japanese Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.640" offset="1077896">This was clear on the findings of fact made by the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.973" offset="1091271">And if that was enough to bear his burden of coming forward, there would have been no need to reverse the cases and send it back for further hearings and further consideration on the issue of duress.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.149" offset="1139963">Now, I pass from the issue of -- of who -- of whether duress is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.610" offset="1169847">I mean, if whether conscription is sufficient to -- for the citizenship claimant to show in order to bear his burden of coming forward with evidence of duress.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.459" offset="1213210">And I pass to the -- that the last question of who has the ultimate burden of proof in the whole case, and perhaps I can state it most succinctly if I say that petitioner's view of the statute is as if it read, a person shall lose his nationality by entering or serving in the armed forces of a foreign state voluntarily -- voluntarily as if that word were in the statute as part of the -- the facts which cause the expatriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.791" offset="1326582">On the other hand, our position is that it's a proviso that its as if Congress had said, “You lose your nationality by entering or serving in the armed forces of a foreign state provided that if you can show that you did it involuntarily, you shall not lose your nationality.”</text>
            <text syncTime="321.629" offset="1389902">I argue with the statute, the citizenship claimant would have the burden of proof that -- that he did enter under duress.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.775" offset="1422503">Now, as a general rule, duress is a defense in our law.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.073" offset="1439640">It is not part of the plaintiff's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.593" offset="1449775">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states specifically that in civil actions, duress must be set up and prove by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.378" offset="1480913">We think that that general rule which occurs in many cases, in fact occurs in the type of cases from which this Court took the clear and convincing rule, the -- the patent -- land patent cases where the Court said the defenses of -- of bona fide of purchase over value had to be set up and proved by the man who had the land patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.642" offset="1569938">Since my time has expired, all I can do is refer the Court to the -- to the discussion in our brief of the legislative history which we think is very important and which shows that Congress deliberately rejected the notion that voluntariness should be proved by the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="387.948" offset="1655202">It is with regret that I find myself disagreeing with Government counsel in a statement yesterday that there are no cases on appeal in which there was not a protest of some type made by the petitioner or by the person claiming citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.746" offset="1738376">In our opening brief, at pages 25 and 26, we have called attention to at least two or three cases, the main one is the Lehmann case in which the Court of Appeals pointed out.</text>

            <text syncTime="427.277" offset="1812459">The omissions which were relied upon by the Government to show voluntary conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.456" offset="1837223">I call attention to the second and third that at a visit to the American Consulate, he did not specifically, did not asked specifically for the protection of the American Consulate and expressed no desire to register as an American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.332" offset="1892707">And number three, he did not protest that the time he entered the Swiss Army or at the time he took the oath of allegiance.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.374" offset="1920920">And the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit said, "With respect to these admissions, it need only be said that they were utterly irrelevant to the critical issue of voluntariness."</text>
            <text syncTime="464.955" offset="1963238">In another case, Monaco against Dulles, which we also call attention to, not only was there no protest but the citizen actually ignored the warnings of the State Department when he was leaving the United States when they told them, he ought not to go until he made sure that he would not have to serve in the Italian Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.993" offset="2035336">And even in the Penn-Delco case upon which the Government relies and which we call attention to on the next page, the Government stresses the fact that the plaintiff did not protest to any United States Consulate that he was being forced to enter Italian military service under duress.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.872" offset="2098866">So I think it's clear that a number of appellate cases have had the question as to whether or not duress was necessary.</text>

Supp. 166, whereon facts essentially similar to those here, the trial court held that the claimant had not lost his American citizenship, this is the Government's explanation as to why they didn't appeal because the District Court's ruling on this point was viewed as correct.</text>
