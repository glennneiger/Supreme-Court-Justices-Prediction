            <label>Mr. Richard N. Clattenburg</label>
            <text syncTime="20.237" offset="184299">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.138" offset="203943">This is a suit brought by a railroad employee for reinstatement in his job after his dismissal under the terms of a union-shop agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.732" offset="262248">In his suit, he asked an opportunity -- he asked that the Railroad and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, petitioners here, to be restrained from continuing his discharge until he'd had an opportunity for readmission to membership in the Brotherhood and further ask that enforcement of the union-shop agreement against him be restrained.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.812" offset="354617">The suit was brought in the District Court for the Western Districts of New York which dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.478" offset="389308">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Hand, reversed and remanded the case for trial on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.798" offset="422536">I will briefly recite the facts as they are alleged in the complaint in the affidavits attached thereto since there is, of course, no further record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.928" offset="463078">The respondent, Mr. Rychlik, was employed by Pennsylvania Railroad as a trainman and was dismissed from service in January of 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.500" offset="509367">Prior to this time, the union shop amendment to Railway Labor Act, Section 2, Eleventh of that Act, was passed by Congress in, I believe, January of 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.077" offset="559731">And, in March of 1952, the Railroad Company and the Brotherhood, the Railroad Trainmen which was a duly asserted representative of the trainmen on the Pennsylvania, entered into a union-shop agreement in conformity with the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.883" offset="622947">In substantially the words of this statute, the agreement provided that all trainmen employed by Pennsylvania, as a condition of their continued employment, must become members of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen and maintain membership in good standing in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.469" offset="693269">The agreement further provided, as required by the statute, that a trainman could satisfy this requirement of membership by holding or acquiring membership in any one of the other labor organizations, national in scope, organized in accordance with the Railway Labor Act and admitting to membership employees of a craft or class in engine, train, yard, or hostling service.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.453" offset="809148">There is a special provision in Section 2, Eleventh (c) of the Railway Labor Act which applies to union-shop agreements between railroads and their employees in what we call the operating classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.667" offset="865991">They are, generally speaking, engineers, firemen, hostlers, conductors, brakemen, and other trainmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.323" offset="900681">There was a specific problem, which will be discussed in more detail later, which required a little different treatment than the union-shop amendment between the operating unions and the non-operating classes, who are, generally speaking, the clerks and others not directly engaged in the movement of a train.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.327" offset="976645">As a result, there is a -- the specific language of the statute states that the requirement of membership in a labor organization in an agreement made pursuant to Section 2, Eleventh (c) shall be satisfied as to a present or future employee in engine, train, yard, or hostling service.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.405" offset="1060968">That is, an employee engaged in any of the services covered in Section 3, First (h) of the Act, that is, a provision defining certain jurisdiction of the National Railroad Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.441" offset="1109138">It says that the requirement of membership shall be satisfied if such an employee holds or acquires membership in any one of the labor organizations, national in scope, organized in accordance with this Act and admitting to membership employees of such a class or craft.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.715" offset="1178206">At first, the respondent Rychlik, was a member of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen in good standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.405" offset="1200985">However, in 9 -- in February of 1953, he resigned his membership in the Brotherhood and became a member of another union, United Railroad Operating Crafts, which he -- well, the complaint states he believed, in good faith, to be national in scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.840" offset="1274755">And, thereafter, respondent and other trainmen in similar situation who had given up their BRT membership in favor of United Railroad Operating Crafts which, if you don't mind, I'll call UROC because that is a preferred method of referring to it, were cited to the Railroad by the Brotherhood because of alleged failure to comply with the union-shop agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.136" offset="1363884">Now, under this agreement, the Railroad and the Brotherhood had established a System Board of Adjustment, which is provided for under Section 3, Second of the Railway Labor Act, to settle any disputes arising in connection with the union-shop agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.657" offset="1430026">Section 3, Second provides an orderly means of settling these minor disputes to the National Railroad Adjustment Board, and specifically state that any carrier or group of carriers can establish a regional or system board of adjustment with the same jurisdiction as the National Railroad Adjustment Board provided for in Section 3, First.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.772" offset="1518425">This union-shop agreement, then, provided that the System Board had jurisdiction over disputes under the union-shop agreement and, further, it provided, as is normal in the case of such system boards, that the Railroad and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen would each have two representatives on the System Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.229" offset="1596270">In case of a deadlock, the deadlock was to be broken by a decision of a neutral appointed by the National Mediation Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.815" offset="1630647">The agreement provided that the decision of the System Board would be final and binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.573" offset="1657710">After the respondent was cited for noncompliance with union-shop agreement, he was given a hearing before the System Board in August 1953, and the second hearing was held a year later, in August 1954, without any further action having been taken against him, in the meantime, under the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.669" offset="1734092">The System Board eventually came to the conclusion that respondent had failed to comply with the union-shop agreement, that his membership in United Railroad Operating Crafts did not constitute compliance with the union-shop agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.249" offset="1788322">As a result, he was discharged from service in January of 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.878" offset="1814862">There was evidence at the hearing before the System Board in August of 1954 that, in the previous month, respondent had joined the Switchmen's Union of -- of North America, which is generally recognized as being a qualified labor union, national in scope, and fitting the terms that I have quoted from the union-shop amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.547" offset="1905560">And, the complainant alleges also that the respondent, at some time after he first resigned from the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, had tendered his dues and applied for reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.812" offset="1954670">After his discharge, the respondent filled this suit in the District Court alleging these facts I have stated, and asking --</text>

            <text syncTime="497.418" offset="2093014">He had resigned from the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen in February of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.393" offset="2112972">The evidence alleged here of joining the Switchmen's Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.238" offset="2124361">It's evidenced that he joined in July of 1954, after about, I believe, 17 -- 15, or 16, or 17 months of not belonging, under this decision of the System Board, to any union, national in scope or coverage.</text>

            <text syncTime="525.046" offset="2203564">The District Court, in this case, ruled that it did not, citing the (Inaudible) case which is referred to in the briefs, which is, I believe, a decision of the Sixth Circuit in which this Court had denied certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="543.414" offset="2277021">So that, he is in the same position that he was in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.577" offset="2289664">I mean, he resigned from the Trainmen and then he joined the UROC and that's where he stands.</text>

            <text syncTime="553.474" offset="2317249">That's -- that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.430" offset="2321115">He may -- I believe he may still be a member of Switchmen's Union but the -- the District Court, in this case, held that the fact he joined the Switchmen's Union did not warrant the Court in exercising its equal powers of intervention and the Second Circuit did not discuss the point in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.661" offset="2406066">The complaint which was filed in the District Court alleged that the -- his discharge violated the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.180" offset="2432084">One of the grounds alleged was that which Mr. Justice Burton has raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.855" offset="2450787">He -- he stated that, after he had joined the Switchmen's Union, despite this lapse in membership in -- from the Brotherhood of the Railroad Trainmen until the time he joined the Switchmen's Union, he alleged that that discharge after he joined the Switchmen's Union was a violation of the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.822" offset="2518706">He also alleged that his discharge after he had applied for reinstatement in the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen and had tendered his dues was a violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.409" offset="2557053">And, he further alleged that the Railway Labor Act had been violated by this agreement in the establishing of a System Board under Section 3, Second to decide these disputes in providing for brotherhood representation on the System Board and in stating that the Board awards would be final and binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.855" offset="2638764">The District Court dismissed the entire complaint for failure to state the cause of action, not on the ground of jurisdiction but for failure to state a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.224" offset="2680247">The Court ruled that the agreement was valid, the union-shop agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.448" offset="2697174">It ruled that the System Board, under the Act, had jurisdiction over any dispute arising under the union-shop agreement and it held that the Brotherhood representation on the System Board did not per se make the Board's decision invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.633" offset="2757883">The Court specifically rule on the question of the respondent's membership in the Switchmen's Union and, also, on the refusal of the Brotherhood to reinstate him and held that neither of these grounds require the Court to exercise its right to intervene, to protect the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.359" offset="2836773">The Court rule that, with regard to the status of UROC as a union, possibly national in scope, it was not necessary for the Court to reach this decision under the facts which were submitted to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.895" offset="2894973">And, the -- and, the District Court pointed to the administrative procedure provided in Section 3 of the Act as the exclusive method of determining this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.451" offset="2941158">Now, the administrative procedure to which the Court there referred is the procedure provided by the Railway Labor Act for determining whether a union is qualified to participate in selecting members of the National Railroad Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.156" offset="3012002">Section 3, First (a) of the Act provides that an adjustment board -- the Adjustment Board shall consist of members to be selected by the carriers and by such labor organizations of the employees, national in scope, has, have been, or may be organized in accordance with the provisions of Section 2 of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.704" offset="3102177">Section 3, First (f) provides that if there is a dispute as to the right of any union to participate in this selection, the dispute will be investigated by the Secretary of Labor who will make a determination, preliminarily, as to whether the claim has merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.809" offset="3186604">And, if in his judgment, it has merit, the Secretary is told to notify the Mediation Board and, after receipt of that advice, the Mediation Board sets up a board of three.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.230" offset="3244283">One representative of the labor unions already recognized as national in scope, for this purpose, one representative of the claimant union, and a neutral appointed by the Mediation Board which makes a final and binding determination as to whether the union is qualified to participate in the selection of members of the Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.231" offset="3344280">This was pointed to by the District Court as being a remedy with regard to determining this question and, on the basis of the Pigott case which had been decided by the Sixth Circuit at that time, the Court -- District Court indicated, pretty clearly, it believed that this was the exclusive method under the Railway Labor Act to determine whether a union was national in scope not only for the purpose of picking Adjustment Board members, but also for purposes of the union-shop amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1277.016" offset="5211408">In the first place, we have had these bipartisan boards under the -- the Railway Labor Act since 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.687" offset="5242128">What the Pennsylvania brief shows in detail is procedure set forth in the Act and, for these boards, a procedure which was followed very closely in setting up this Board under the union-shop agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.075" offset="5291656">Thus, there is nothing new or novel in a bipartisan board of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.215" offset="5308270">And, this Court, of course, has held in the Slocum case and E, J &amp; E case that the purpose of these boards is to settle these minor disputes and keep them out of the courts and to keep peace in the Railroad Industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1315.074" offset="5363649">The second point is that there is nothing new or novel in having an opposition between an individual whether or not -- an individual employee, whether or not he is a union member, and the union that there is nothing new or novo except that in the union-shop situation, under these agreements, there is a greater focus, perhaps, on that because it is implicit in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.072" offset="5463646">Congress has seen fit to provide that there will be a conflict of interest there between the union and an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.096" offset="5503770">However, that can happen in any case that goes before the National Adjustment Board or a system board because, in the most -- Picayune pay claim, that claim may very well be contrary to union policy.</text>

            <label>Mr. Henry Kaiser</label>
            <text syncTime="1657.020" offset="6731421">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.800" offset="6738526">Now, the point to which I address my remarks illuminates completely any questions of hostility or conflict between the employee and the statutory representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.147" offset="6808012">I start with the rather startling statement that, in my judgment, the premise upon which the Court below reached the result it did means certain chaos in railway labor relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.533" offset="6897455">Now, let's examine precisely the reasoning adopted by the Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.058" offset="6931623">It, in effect, conceded that the Section 3 procedure that Mr. Clattenburg described was a thoroughly impartial unbiased procedure, but it certainly reject that procedure and it asserted two reasons for that rejection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.728" offset="7014275">Now, I past by that first reason namely that the qualifications imposed by the statute upon labor organizations in order to be able to select members to the Board are different from the qualifications appearing in the union-shop amendment of 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.868" offset="7110823">I say, if I may, that the learned judge simply didn't do his homework.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.075" offset="7131721">A reading of the statute shows, beyond question of doubt, that the qualifications are almost in haec verba identical and certainly in substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.429" offset="7177070">There is no difference between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.884" offset="7190862">The second reason is a more interesting one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.160" offset="7211969">He starts with the premise that, under the 1951 amendment, employees who are covered by a union-shop agreement were granted by Congress the right to join any other union, that is to say, other than the contracting union, which they -- the employees believe to qualify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.467" offset="7341223">Then, the judge went on to point out that the Section 3 procedure, being available only to unions, not to employees, concluded that he must have his right, that is, the individual employee, himself to prove subsequently that, previously, he believed to be the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.031" offset="7455535">Now, let me make that more exquisite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.163" offset="7468074">The critical aspect of the decision below is that employees may, first, join unions and, subsequently, in a court of law, prove that the unions they joined met the requirements of the 1951 amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.199" offset="7564204">Now, to please the Court, it seems to me that any rule of law --</text>

            <text syncTime="1880.518" offset="7625435">I say that any rule of law that, in one breath, says that parties may enter into a lawful agreement and, in the second, precludes those parties from knowing the terms of their own agreement from confidently performing their own obligation, from mutually agrees on the meaning and scope of their own agreement, I say that reflects an internal contradiction that's completely insupportable no matter what the subject matter of the agreement or how privately limited its impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.595" offset="7833788">Now, how much greater is that contradiction when we're dealing with an agreement authorized by the Congress covering labor relations in an industry whose welfare, whose labor peace is so vital to the nation's welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.824" offset="7946637">The statute, in its declaration of purposes and in its substantive provisions, exhorts and mandates the parties to minimize their differences and resolve their disputes by the most informal and expeditious methods possible, notably, conferences and direct negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.516" offset="8053426">This Court, in the leading Virginia case, said, “the major objective of the statute is the avoidance of industrial strife by conference between the authorized representative, but of what avail, what utility, a conference by the parties who are handicapped by a coerced ignorance as to the meaning of their union-shop agreement, and how a void industrial strife if the normal self-interest of the parties to the agreement compels conflict.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.170" offset="8268048">Now, let's picture the realistic situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.235" offset="8284348">Brotherhood here has a contrast with a carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.717" offset="8302216">Brotherhood says to the carrier, “Mr. Rychlik, respondent here, is not a member of our Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.645" offset="8337951">He's not a member of another union, national in scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.793" offset="8354565">We, therefore -- we, therefore, request you to comply with your commitment and discharge Mr. Rychlik.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.052" offset="8387584">Now, if the opinion below is affirmed, the carrier, at an understandable interest to prevent the incurrence of liability, would say, “we cannot discharge Mr. Rychlik until we get some court determination that UROC is not national in scope.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.204" offset="8492178">The Union would say, “Very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.408" offset="8512972">We insist upon you discharging him because no court has as yet said that UROC is national in scope.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.887" offset="8558947">In short, gentlemen, the necessary inevitable result of the decision below is to invite industrial strife rather than to avoid it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.416" offset="8624985">It is unthinkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.695" offset="8634180">It is unthinkable that the Congress created a right in these individuals, employees, as defined by the Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.233" offset="8688306">Now, what did Congress have in mind?</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.818" offset="8702621">Congress, we say, left to the individuals, and I underscore the word “left” because the 1951 amendment granted to employees nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3244.471" offset="13081266">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.131" offset="13099865">As the lower court said in substance in this case, nothing would more completely defeat the most elementary requirements of fair play and nothing with more firmly entrenched the recognized union in power than a holding that judicial review was not necessary from the decision of the System Board in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.360" offset="13200802">I would like to discuss the application of Section 3, First (f) and the entrenchment of the unions in power, and Mr. Fix will discuss the elementary requirements of fair play.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.868" offset="13242807">We've broken up our argument in that way in order to better tie it in with the opposition argument which was presented in that manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.274" offset="13276453">Now, the technical provisions of Section 3, First (f) dealing with labor union eligibility to participate in the selection of labor members to the Adjustment Board has nothing to do with the employee's statutory right to hold his job if he belongs to a union which is national in scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.485" offset="13377285">Now, under any construction of the statute, eligibility for a seat on the Board cannot be a possibly -- cannot possibly be an adequate remedy to the employee for bias on the System Board level because Section 3, First (f) is not applicable to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.463" offset="13453249">He can't get a seat on the Board and he has no way of compelling his union to get a seat on the Board, and I might point out that that was the only argument that was made in the lower court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.522" offset="13493478">The second argument of exclusiveness was certain -- certainly not firmly pressed, if pressed at all, in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.809" offset="13526601">Now, because of the lower court holding, the petitioner's now argue that national in scope exception to the union-shop requirement which Congress cast in terms of employee rights really confers a right not on the employee, but on his labor organization to exempt him from the union-shop requirement not if that union is national in scope, no, but if it is qualified to participate in the selection of Adjustment Board members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.167" offset="13651989">And, they further argue that a seat on the Board is the only way, the exclusive way, that national in scope status could be achieved and this argument is also very necessary because if there's any discretion left in the System Board, we're, again, presented with a question of the bias in the System Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="3424.361" offset="13800782">Now, to accomplish the results which the petitioners are asking for here, the statute has to be drastically rewritten in its language.</text>

            <text syncTime="3472.735" offset="13994297">It was argued to this Court in the Elgin case that, despite expressed language to the contrary, the statute did not give the employee a right to process his own grievances but, instead, gave this right to his union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.311" offset="14068590">Now, this Court specifically rejected this argument in the Elgin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.584" offset="14089697">Now, certainly, the employee's right to have a fair determination made on whether or not he is entitled to hold his job, which is the basic question here, is as basic as his right to process his own grievances, which this Court said he had in the Elgin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.854" offset="14170781">Now, in the Elgin case, this Court went so far as to specifically reject the past practices of the National Railroad Adjustment Board in reaching its conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.416" offset="14209024">In that case, the National Railroad Adjustment Board has specifically held in the past that the employee did not have an individual right to adjust his own grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.389" offset="14240893">Now, here, the Court does not have to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.978" offset="14255313">Past precedent confirms that the right to determine national in scope status of his union is in the employee and that the labor unions qualifying for a seat on the Board is not the exclusive manner in which national in scope status can be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.436" offset="14317066">Now, all of the past decisions dealing with UROC and its members, with the exception of one case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.091" offset="14339741">The District Court case -- District Court opinion in the Pigott case, including the majority and minority opinion in the Pigott case in the Court of Appeals, all, at least tacitly, assumed that this right given by the statute is in the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.907" offset="14402957">There is no case cited to the contrary, with the exception of the District Court opinion in the Pigott case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.093" offset="14431796">Therefore, at least in line with court authority, there is no precedent especially in view of the Elgin case, a decision of the Court, for a holding that the individual rights are not in the employee.</text>

            <text syncTime="3710.780" offset="14946513">Now, I was getting to the point that the Government had made, in its amici curiae brief, the Government -- and this is the only -- the only argument that is made in terms of statutory construction as far as its right in the employee, the Government, in its brief, points to the expanded language in the union-shop amendment as justifying the interpretation that Congress intended to vest the right in the labor union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.305" offset="15032613">Now, the obvious answer to this is, why, instead of using the expanded language, didn't Congress save themselves about 15 words and say that the employee can maintain his job, can hold his job if he belongs to an organization which is qualified under Section 3, First (h)?</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.603" offset="15093739">It's a much simpler way of putting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.514" offset="15101471">Now, even disregarding this, aside from this, the expanded language has a much simpler explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.744" offset="15134386">Now, the expanded language which the government refers to and, by expanded language, I mean that they must be national in scope, organized in accordance with the Act, and fairly represent the members of a craft or class, or -- I don't mean that word “fairly,” I meant represent members of a craft or class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.515" offset="15189452">This language is identical in its terms to Section 3, First (a), not Section 3, First (f) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.019" offset="15223411">Now, there was an administrative determination, two of them, two administrative determinations made of the meaning of Section 3, First (a), and these determinations were made by the Secretary of Labor who, incidentally, they were made under a Section 3, First (f) proceeding but they were made as interpretations of Section 3, First (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.553" offset="15293628">And, in these determinations, the Secretary set forth a definition of the phrase “national in scope” and this is his definition in substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.676" offset="15330095">He says that, “to be national in scope, a union must represent employees of different companies rather than be organized within a single company or carrier and have more or less of a general dissemination throughout the country and,” he didn't use that exact language but he used these criteria to show that, “geographical area of representation, number of employees represented, number of agreements, number of carriers with whom agreements are held, and the mileage of such carriers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.037" offset="15431555">Now, we say that the expanded language of -- that Congress used in the union-shop amendment, Section 2, Eleventh (c), they use that language to incorporate the previous definition of the Secretary of Labor and, instead of using that definition, they could use very few words to accomplish that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.745" offset="15498324">Now, that becomes very significant in view of the argument that chaos and confusion and uncertainty will result if judicial review is put into this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.489" offset="15573347">The emphasis on this -- in this case is not on the legal, the morale, or the statutory justification for importing wholesale the provisions of Section 3, First (f) and Section 3, First (a) into this union-shop amendment and changing the language of the union-shop amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.388" offset="15640952">The emphasis is not -- are none of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.433" offset="15649102">The emphasis here and the starting point of Counsel's argument before this Court was chaos and confusion and uncertainty will result if this isn't done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.412" offset="15685047">Therefore, you must do it, in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3900.327" offset="15704691">Now, remembering the Secretary of Labor's definition in light of this argument, as I say -- said before, the Secretary of Labor's definition becomes very important for, under the Secretary of Labor's definition, we'd have a definite guide to everyone as to what national in scope means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.164" offset="15792044">Under the opposite construction, if Section 3, First (f) is deemed to be an exclusive remedy, we have certainty, as far as the recognized organization goes, the certainty of being entrenched, there'll never be a challenge by any new organization successfully, number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.489" offset="15857351">You have certainty as to them, but you have no certainty, for example, as to the employee or as to the new union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.153" offset="15883995">Now, the employee cannot make any independent determination of his own as to whether he can join a competing union because he doesn't know whether it's national in scope or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3955.134" offset="15923911">There's no definition at all advanced under their theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3957.629" offset="15933837">The definition is that it's going to be given some time in the future by a three-man board which, since 1934, has never been convened and which may never be convened in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3967.876" offset="15974902">So, in other words, no one knows what it means.</text>

            <text syncTime="4059.466" offset="16341243">And, he stepped in on the theory, and I'd like to quote his language on that because I think I feel it's very significant, “that the participating organization seemed to have carefully avoided taking any position on this matter.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4070.088" offset="16383770">So, in other words, once it becomes evident enough to everyone that the participating organizations, because of self-interest, will do nothing, then, the Secretary of Labor could step in.</text>
