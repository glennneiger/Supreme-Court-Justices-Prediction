            <label>Mr. John H. Hudson</label>
            <text syncTime="27.378" offset="212929">Mr. Chief Justice, associate justices, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.510" offset="253367">It is my hope in presentation the case for the petitioners that we will give the Court a rest from some of these abstruse and profound principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.818" offset="354617">This case comes to this on a report by which of the fact that a man by the name of Gordon P. Haynes during the year 1949 was an employee of the Southern Bell Telephone Company under what is called here a plan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.346" offset="452733">I'm sorry Your Honor, I'm really not able to carry on but it's a proposition where one has to so I do the best I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.654" offset="501948">This plan is incorporated in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.603" offset="521801">It has a schedule of payments to its employees fixed on the length of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.235" offset="580315">Mr. Haynes suffered an accident prior to the time he become ill with what is known as causalgia or balloon nerve.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.207" offset="628172">During this 1949, he did not perform any service for the Southern Bell Telephone Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.547" offset="669550">He was home sick so the record in the evidence show.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.966" offset="687208">Did not so much as go to the office because of his disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.874" offset="718869">When the time came for passing upon the question of whether or not the $2100 which he earned that year or which came to him by virtue of the fact that he was home sick, was taxable as income -- gross income or was exempt under Section 22, the fact the Telephone Company itself was not certain about it so they went ahead and turned $318.44 to the tax Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.246" offset="896397">Then the case of Epmeier came along and the question rolled as to whether or not this entire fund was what is called under this exemption or under the law, income law whether or not it was income or whether or not it was upon receive because of illness, sickness or was benefit upon received from this plan as such that it was not proceeds from capital on the part of Haynes, that it was not earnings on the part of Haynes and therefore the entire $2100 was exempt from taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.982" offset="1095346">And the question before the court is at this time whether or not this is income, gross income and is taxable or whether or not it is fund received from sickness and disability benefits and therefore is exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.192" offset="1200149">Now we think and may it please the Court, that we are dealing here with the exemption not so much of the tax statute as funds which are exempt under the 22 (b) (5) that are not taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.984" offset="1315297">Our contention is that this cannot be what is known as income from labor because under the plan and Haynes had served under this plan more than the 25-year period and was entitled to what is known under the plan as full compensation or full payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.599" offset="1425742">Now, the Government takes this view of this entire proposition that the payments which went to Mr. Haynes while he was sick and totally disabled was simply a continuation of salary plan and that it was taxable.</text>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="357.620" offset="1533889">What was it?</text>
            <text syncTime="358.221" offset="1536293">The amount of the salary?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_h_hudson" startTime="360.114" stopTime="719.571">
            <label>Mr. John H. Hudson</label>
            <text syncTime="360.114" offset="1543816">The amount of the salary, the total he earned in 1949, may it please the Court was $2100.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.523" offset="1573491">Now that, may it please Your Honor was the sum which he would have received if he had been on the job the full 52 weeks of 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.821" offset="1634617">That is one point which the Government contends that this is income and it is taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.726" offset="1670248">It is not sick and disability benefits which are exempt under the statute involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.548" offset="1713612">We think among some other contention that it must the intent and purpose of this plan, it really in substance is insurance, although it is not marked or labeled insurance and the Government points out that that is one of the weaknesses of our contention then it is not issued by a commercial insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.096" offset="1835760">No objection that the government has to our contention is that this plan and this -- what we call for petitioners, sick benefit do not require and the company does not require that its employees pay a cash premium for this protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.515" offset="1945475">Now we don't think that that really makes any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.271" offset="1968462">The services which he rendered to the Telephone Company as an employee for more than 25 years, we think is ample payment of what we may term premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.912" offset="2047039">Now there are several -- there are several other marks of similarities and marks of dissimilarity in -- on both sides of this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.467" offset="2105240">If I could bring myself to conceive of a person who does not qualify either under receiving something from capitals such as interest or grants on an investment or not receiving something for the labor that he performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.433" offset="2213073">If I could bring myself to the conclusion that nevertheless that sort of income is taxable then I wouldn't be here before this honorable Court but I just cannot conceive of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.922" offset="2283081">We get income from two sources mainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.511" offset="2301367">One of them is from capital investing.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.710" offset="2322160">The other one is from our labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.855" offset="2338774">Haynes had neither.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.620" offset="2349850">This came to him straight because he was protected or because he came under this plan and because he was sick and could not perform any service.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.010" offset="2399378">Now on capital -- look at this pamphlet which is the heart of our record, you will find that there are graduated scales.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.650" offset="2461968">One reason or one point made by the Government and I'm trying to be as brief as I can and -- but I do want to be clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.703" offset="2514213">I don't know that I shall be that at all but I want to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.395" offset="2544933">Since Haynes had neither capital nor labor and since this benefit fund came to him by reason of the fact of the length of his employment with the Telephone Company and by reason of the provisions of the plan of the Telephone Company which has given to each employee as the employee starts to work for the Telephone Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.233" offset="2640332">And the employee has to do two years work for the Telephone Company without the provisions or any benefit at all, sickness or disability or accident before he begins to receive any benefit from the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.842" offset="2718699">Now we say in our contention is that this is obliged to be insurance because we don't pay people for being sick.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.149" offset="2771989">We can't afford to pay people for being sick.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.140" offset="2783901">It is their sickness and not their services that brings this benefit to the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.835" offset="2818696">If we could say as it's sometimes contended that well the Telephone Company then has a plan which makes sickness and accident profitable, then we should reverse our philosophy with reference to those -- to disadvantages and arrange some way to have as many accidents and as much sickness as possible in order to profit by that, but that's inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.703" offset="2934157">That's an inconsistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.605" offset="2941785">That is not the way human affairs ran and that is not the way business is ran.</text>

            <text syncTime="773.002" offset="3195382">Another point of distinction if I may proceed is that the Southern Bell Telephone Company is not licensed in the State of Georgia to rate sickness and disability insurance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1117.631" offset="4573915">The Government takes a view of it that that is not to be interpreted as broadening the exemption, that this to be taken, that is to be viewed in a limited sense and simply applies to the exemption and is to be construed in a restricted sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.954" offset="4679137">Now the Government begins with the history of this taxation and comes all up to that particular point and it didn't appear brilliant and a very skillful manner we think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.179" offset="4724067">Now we start right, if it please the Court, and we go back down to the same trail that the Government comes up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.375" offset="4764923">It is our opinion and it is our contention in this case that what they did, what Congress did in 1954 was illustrated of the intent of Congress at the time they made that amendment, that all the time, these questions were coming up from 1913, 1918, 1924 and questions arose that the tax commissioner was referenced to some claims, was in doubt that's in the case of American Telephone and Telegraph Company, December 24, 1918 when they rule that this kind of compensation or this kind of income was not taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.742" offset="5006294">And then we drew along a little bit further in the history of this taxation when the tax commissioners in various places held that it was gross income and that it was taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.082" offset="5067734">Now taking the 1954 amendment which was put through by Congress as indicating or a circumstance which may indicate an Act which -- from which we might infer that all the time, all these years from 1913 to 1954, it was the intention of Congress to exempt funds received from this type of benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.580" offset="5225723">In other words, this particular kind of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.775" offset="5250487">Now that is exactly we know, contract to the contention of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.552" offset="5273579">Now here, we have a -- we have live, we have a vital issue not affecting compensation received under this plan or any other employer-employee plan but affecting a large number of claims now pending in the various Circuit Courts of this country under this plan and similar plans as to their earnings up to and during 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.793" offset="5438568">Now we say very frankly, candidly that if this honorable Court takes our view of it, makes a ruling in favor of the taxpayer, it follows on necessity that the Government will lose some revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.753" offset="5530415">But we also take this viewpoint, it's our contention that this nontaxable income is correct, then the withholding of these funds -- pardon me please -- from these taxpayers in the various Circuit Courts did not give the Government a title to these funds or this particular fund as they're sticking straight to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.505" offset="5681403">And in as much as it did not, in as much as the Government as we contend collected it illegally, it never had the title to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.701" offset="5718183">It was not entitled under the law if our contention is correct, to receive these funds or hold these funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.023" offset="5751515">Therefore, in the estimate, advised by the Government and we got no right to dispute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.389" offset="5788923">It isn't -- we've got no way of disputing it successfully even if it is a mere estimate that approximately $6 million are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.489" offset="5829360">We say that our position is direct if we are right, then all of the funds that are being held now by the tax commission since 1949 and even prior of that time up to the statute of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.655" offset="5901981">It is holding -- it is withholding those funds from the taxpayers illegally, therefore an order requiring the commissioner to make these various refunds in whatever amount is perfectly all right because the Government is not really losing anything that it was entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.212" offset="6000201">Now there is another side of course to this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.834" offset="6034683">While some $6 million in funds probably more, probably less are involved in actual dollars and cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.835" offset="6086719">There is a large number of employees of the various companies through the years have founded beneficial to inaugurate or establish a plan although no cash premiums are required in order to receive the benefits under the plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="1630.763" offset="6626408">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.171" offset="6652008">I think it's quite clear from Mr. Hudson's remark what this Court has a narrow little question of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.141" offset="6691924">These are the statute in question which was governing during the years here in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.100" offset="6735809">Here are some of the appendix to our brief beginning at the bottom of page 40 up to page 41 that being code Section 22 (b) (5).</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.477" offset="6789308">It creates an exemption from tax -- I'll skip the opening part of the sentence which has no relation to our problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.058" offset="6827656">It exempts amounts received through accident or health insurance or under Workmen's Compensation Act, compensation for personal injuries or sickness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.449" offset="6885125">Those are the amounts which are exempt from tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.970" offset="6911248">At the beginning of the page appears old Section 22 (a) with which this Court has had much familiarity where Congress has defined in the broadest terms possible, its concepts of what is taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.184" offset="6976136">And of course included in Section 22 (a) is compensation for personal services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.432" offset="7009050">So the definitional section includes compensation for personal services and the exclusion section exempts amounts received for sickness under health insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.073" offset="7063698">And so the question here really is this, where an employer either voluntarily or pursuant to a plan as it's true in this case, undertakes to tell its employees that we will continue to pay you in whole or in part some part of your salary during some periods that you maybe ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.229" offset="7168293">Is that compensation for personal services as the Government contends?</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.965" offset="7191280">Or is that amounts received for illness under health insurance which Congress has exempted under Section 22 --</text>

            <text syncTime="1821.956" offset="7391169">You have defendant's exhibit number one which starts at page 88.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.755" offset="7410395">As I recall, this is part of the, one of the annual statements of Southern Bell Telephone Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.119" offset="7439862">And toward the bottom of page 89, there is paragraph dealing with sickness and accidents and it says at the second line, a total of $1,700,000 is paid as sickness disability benefits under the plan and $1,090,000 for sickness pay during the first seven days of absence was charged a departmental expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.490" offset="7533380">You'll immediately see that the amounts paid during his first seven days are not substantially less than the amount paid under the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.847" offset="7562742">The only difference as I understand it is, that under the plan which the company of course had the right to change it anytime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.475" offset="7593253">But under the plan, precisely what you would receive was set forth while during the first seven days, it was discretionary for the company to pay or not to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.036" offset="7639542">But I would guess from these figures that the company exercises discretion mostly to pay and that's the only difference that I can see between what was paid during the first seven days and what would be paid after, inclusion of the first week of illness and yet the contention here of that is that what's paid under the first seven days is not exempt and what's paid after the first seven days is exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.954" offset="7739225">In our view, both payments as I shall develop I hope is compensation for services rendered or to be rendered by the employee and it's nothing more or less than that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2718.623" offset="10977886">The fact that Congress had a definite notion of what is insurance and what is not insurance, we think is also evident by another amendments that took place in related areas between 1918 and 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.494" offset="11045386">For example, from the very beginning, amounts received as life insurance had been exempt for income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.568" offset="11081644">Now then the question would arise paralleling this case where under a plan of the employer and its part of the plan to which this employer had certain lump sum payments are made to a widow or other beneficiaries when an employee dies, is that insurance?</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.489" offset="11153324">Now it seems to me that if the taxpayer's argument here that payments during illness is insurance, by wide token and payments on death or to be regarded as life insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.976" offset="11199300">And yet, it was not until 1951 that Congress put in a special exemption where amounts paid by an employer to an employees beneficiaries on death and then put in a limited exemption, limited amount so that from this I would draw some conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.749" offset="11298356">The first that when Congress spoke about insurance, it had a very definite concept in mind and it didn't think that in payments made by an employer to an employee or to an employee's beneficiary were insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.884" offset="11358960">Secondly, that when Congress with the social objective in mind has created this kind of an exemption is done limited in amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.507" offset="11397413">In other words, I think lurking in there is the feeling that companies cannot create large reserves for their favorite officers and get a tax exemption that was never intended to encompass that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.178" offset="11464077">In other words, if the president of the company is sick, Congress didn't intend that his entire salary during illness should be exempt and the president of the company will receive several hundred thousand dollars on his death from the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.891" offset="11514964">Congress didn't intend that that should be exempted as life insurance.</text>
