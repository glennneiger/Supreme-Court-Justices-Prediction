            <text syncTime="10.051" offset="143548">Thank you, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.311" offset="148668">I think that it might be a good point of departure for this after recess just to briefly state what the Court of Appeals said if the rule was that they were applying.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.861" offset="194853">And they said that the test is whether there's a collision between the personal interest of those in control of the corporation and the interest of the corporation itself in the subject matter in the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.859" offset="242813">Such antagonism may appear from the relationship of those in control of the corporation to the defendants or by the words or acts of those in control, which as a matter of fact, proven attitude antagonistic to the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.369" offset="300805">That's on the last page practically of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.658" offset="313971">That's the test the Court of Appeals said they were applying.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.298" offset="328600">Now, this -- this corporation doesn't fall within either of those circumstances, controlled by the real defendants is not alleged and sometimes referred to in a case as domination or in antagonistic hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.350" offset="384815">And it is in a case where the corporation has taken sides with the real defendant, become partners in litigation with the real defendants, actively participating in the defense in such manner that the Court can conclude that the corporation is in antagonistic hands with respect to the basic controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.731" offset="474258">Now, in the Court of Appeals, in its opinion and I believe our brief also amply demonstrate that no hostility or antagonism was alleged or shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.791" offset="514487">The complaint doesn't allege facts which charge that the people were in control.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.501" offset="545416">Now, referring to the complaint here, he referred -- Mr. Doyle did on his argument to the fact that there was a statement about hostile hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.291" offset="580524">I'd like to read just a very short excerpt from the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.623" offset="593899">It's from paragraph 4 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="124.353" offset="600795">It starts at the bottom of page 6 of the record, the last sentence, “A stockholder's resolution directing the bringing of suit would be futile, since the control of such action would be in hostile hands for the reason that the officers and directors and counsel for the Railway Company have indicated as plaintiffs are informed and believed that they do not believe this suit should be brought and they would refuse to bring it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="150.523" offset="705494">In other words, the complaint says that the action be in hostile hands because the directors have indicated they'd refused to bring a suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="206.492" offset="929311">He -- and he made a statement in the Court of Appeals, which were cited at great length, the reasons why the corporation had refused to commence the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.643" offset="965987">Those are the reasons that the plaintiff should have put in its complaint but didn't and Mr. Busch supplied those by affidavit.</text>

            <text syncTime="222.975" offset="995244">You would -- you would say that that affidavit wouldn't be sufficient then because it failed to show sufficient facts to indicate that the directors were not exercising an honest judgment?</text>

            <text syncTime="1118.128" offset="4575901">And it said that that complaint failed to charge that the corporation or those in control of it were hostile to the prosecution of this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.213" offset="4612263">Then, it said, “Secondly, the named plaintiffs say that if matters beyond the complaint are to be looked to, the decisive fact is that the answer filed by the Railway Company controverts the complaint and important particulars referring specifically to paragraph 16 of the answer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.355" offset="4700766">Then, the Court examined that paragraph of the answer and held that that didn't -- that that answer did not show antagonism to the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.039" offset="4747577">Then they examined some other conduct, the conduct that Mr. Busch, the counsel for the corporation in -- which is recited at great length.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.179" offset="4796061">Here, is his statements to the Court and they found that each of those statements showed that there was no antagonism towards this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.924" offset="4843081">They didn't make any findings of fact there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.494" offset="4853321">Then they -- they make -- they make the final statement in the opinion that's on the very last page of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.192" offset="4888116">It says, “Situations readily suggest themselves in which plaintiffs might be impeded in preparing in prosecuting a case such as a refusal of the corporation's permit to access to its files and records, or the corporation is giving aid to the defendants in opposing the suit.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.035" offset="4963558">It says, “No such relationship, words, or acts are charged by the plaintiffs in this case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.474" offset="4989262">Well, that's my full point on that finding of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.732" offset="5002324">The Court of Appeals made no findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.482" offset="5013295">It said we -- if we accept the plaintiff's contention that this is to be determined on the complaint alone, the complaint is inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.631" offset="5041925">The plaintiffs in their reply brief that pointed the certain facts which they say are decisive that antagonism exists with -- the Court of Appeals examined each one of those alleged facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.875" offset="5082885">Really, they were the answer in the conduct of counsel, that's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.480" offset="5097305">They weren't all this matter in the depositions of any and said, “We don't find that in any of those.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.607" offset="5125831">There is evidence of antagonism toward this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.837" offset="5138683">Then they went on they said, “We -- we can conceive of situations for there might be antagonism shown by corporate conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.460" offset="5169194">No such conduct is charged.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.686" offset="5178075">Now, that's prior from the finding of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.977" offset="5195316">And clearly of a failure to charge essential facts is to be differentiated from a making a findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.547" offset="5225514">Now, we contended in the Court of Appeals that in -- Mr. Doyle talked about this summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.427" offset="5261040">One of the things we contended in the Court of Appeals was on the state of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.282" offset="5276505">Summary judgment was justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.582" offset="5285700">We've submitted affidavits and we've submitted depositions and these people had had a year or two years to submit countervailing material and they didn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.602" offset="5325824">Now, if they thought there was anything in the facts that would show that there was antagonism, it was up to them either to amend their complaint as Mr. justice Black suggested to charge such conduct or at least to show by an affidavit or deposition or some other way to point out a fact which showed that there was antagonism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.139" offset="5431881">And the -- the facts that they pointed out to the Court of Appeals, the Court of Appeals held it didn't show any such conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.899" offset="5466990">It didn't charged it and the burden is on them to charge it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3470.355" offset="13984789">Now, I don't suggest, Your Honor, it is the moment I don't suggest that I'm talking now about the equitable basis for a stockholder suit once you're in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.075" offset="14019688">That's a separate question on which we would like some time to be heard in this case, but -- but I'm saying that for purposes of alignment and for the application of the rule of the Indianapolis case or for any of the cases that I've held that there must be a genuine difference that separates this plaintiff's stockholders from the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.946" offset="14111117">For those purposes, I say that the question must be whether the refusal was real and not feign, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.876" offset="14158869">Now, we cite as one authority for that proposition a case decided by this Court, Chicago against Mills in 204 U.S.two years after Doctor and Harrington which we believe is a wholly, and which we believe it was necessary to a holding in a case and it was a jurisdictional case that this proposition be recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.955" offset="14255208">In other words, in Chicago against Mills, the directors had refused -- the directors of a utility company in Chicago had refused to bring a suit to enjoin the enforcement of a certain rate regulation of the City of Chicago and it was admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.951" offset="14323127">I shouldn't say admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.777" offset="14326471">It was in the pleadings that the reason they refused to bring the suit was they thought that if they brought such a suit, they'd get in trouble with the city council of Chicago and that the Mayor would get after him and that they'd have a of political trouble in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.137" offset="14383940">So, they decided for what the Court called prudential reasons, not to -- not to bring the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.327" offset="14416645">The plaintiff's stockholder from another state then brought the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.707" offset="14434200">There was a long and it involves procedural history of that case too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.157" offset="14447992">Ultimately, it came to this Court on the question of jurisdiction and you'll understand there's no suggestion of hostility on the part of the directors who refused the suit toward the plaintiff who brought it, but only a genuine disagreement, and -- and it was also suggested of course by the defense that this was collusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.907" offset="14526986">The collusion question was -- was explored below and also explored in the Supreme Court, and they held there was no collusion, and then the Court held that there was federal jurisdiction.</text>
