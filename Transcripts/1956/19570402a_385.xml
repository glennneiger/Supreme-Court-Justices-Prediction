            <text syncTime="18.613" offset="177821">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.997" offset="187329">This case involves a little switching railroad at the Harbor of San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.919" offset="231006">The railroad is one the facilities of San Francisco Harbor.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.017" offset="251486">San Francisco Harbor is operated by the State of California to facilitate the national and international trade of the port.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.958" offset="311254">The Harbor Board is appointed by the Governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.611" offset="329853">The employees of the State Belt Railroad since 1913 have been members of the state civil service.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.407" offset="380949">Our state constitution requires that all employees of the State with certain minor exceptions shall be members of the California State civil service system.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.364" offset="440822">In 1942, a demand was made upon the Harbor Board that it enter into a collective bargaining contract pursuant to the Railway Labor Act fixing wages, hours, and terms of employment for the employees of the State Belt.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.086" offset="539669">There is no -- it is admitted here that the State Belt Railroad is engaged in interstate commerce as well as settled by United States against California.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.664" offset="590033">The successor, a -- a contract was entered into effective September 1, 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.150" offset="623992">A successor of Harbor Board questioned the authority of the -- the previous Board to enter into this contract and requested the Attorney General to bring a declaratory relief action in the California courts to determine the validity of the contract and whether California was subject to the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.789" offset="714480">The California Supreme Court held that the general language of the Railway Labor Act was not to be interpreted as being applicable to the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.782" offset="770487">Thereupon, the respondents here, who were members of the State Belt employees and who had filed claims before the Adjustment Board under this contract, brought an action to require the Adjustment Board to proceed to hear and determine the claims which had been filed under the 1942 contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.034" offset="899532">The reason this arose was that -- following the decision of the California Supreme Court, the carrier members of the Board had refused to proceed with the cases on the ground that the matter had been settled by the decision of the California Supreme Court.California intervened in this mandamus action and filed a motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.913" offset="1011022">The District Court granted our judgment on the ground, the California decision was determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.516" offset="1037458">However, the Seventh Circuit reversed and held contrary to the decision of the California Supreme Court that the Railway Labor Act was applicable to a State in its operation of a carrier in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.930" offset="1127111">Now, the essential problem we have here is whether the Railway Labor Act is applicable to the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.873" offset="1170892">The Act, if Your Honors please, covers a carrier by Railroad subject to the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.951" offset="1211225">And the Interstate Commerce Act in turn applies to all carriers engaged in the transportation of passages and property holding by railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.404" offset="1256991">In other words, the Railway Labor Act compendiously adopts the determination of what is to be considered as interstate railroad commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.391" offset="1320939">The Act requires all carriers as employers to engage in collective bargaining with representatives chosen for each craft on its property.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.704" offset="1382170">Duties are imposed with respect to the selection of representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.712" offset="1402232">The duty to collectively bargain may be enforced by injunction as this Court decided in the Virginian Railroad case.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.770" offset="1434415">All disputes, and this is how we arrive in Chicago, all disputes under the Act, regarding the interpretation of contracts may be taken by either party to the National Railroad Adjustment Board and -- and a money award made to an employee may be enforced on -- by the specific terms of the Act by suit against the employer in one of the federal district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.962" offset="1579238">So, we are faced essentially, Your Honors, with determining if Congress in using the general language of the Act, all carriers subject to the Interstate Commerce Act by that general language intended to control a State's relationship with its employees when that State is engaged in conducting a carrier engaged in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.251" offset="1700342">In other words, must our civil service laws give way to the -- to the collective bargaining provisions of the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.233" offset="1740257">The history of the Act shows that Congress gave no consideration to the fact that there might be here and there, a -- a carrier owned by a State, such as our switching railroad, engaged in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.474" offset="1805249">As this Court has pointed out, the Act was the result of a -- of a conference, a industry wide conference composed of some 55 railroads and 20 labor unions which produced this, as we have to call it, this instrument for Government in their -- in the railroad industry, to Congress and it was so adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.222" offset="1908276">In approaching this problem, we rely upon the rule that where there is a restrictive statute and it's -- the claim is that it's applicable to Government that the restrictive statute will not be applied unless there are expressed words to that effect or unless there are affirmative reasons for believing that Congress intended to apply it to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.905" offset="2023006">The latest -- one of the latest expressions was by this Court in the Wittek case.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.511" offset="2045367">Now, what are the basic and in that regard, we should examine the Act as has been said in its total environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.441" offset="2089148">What were the objective of the Act and the subject matter and so forth?</text>
            <text syncTime="499.832" offset="2102732">Well, the stated purposes of the Act in Section 151 (a) were that to avoid interruptions in commerce and in it -- in the interstate railroad commerce, the employers should engage in collective bargaining for the purpose of establishing rates, hours and working conditions for their employees.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herbert E. Wenig</label>
            <text syncTime="538.511" offset="2257377">The stated objective of the Railway Labor Act was to prevent strikes which would be obstructions in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.178" offset="2304084">Strikes are not characteristic of public employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.462" offset="2325191">The Labor Management Act provides that federal employees are even prohibited from striking and may even lose their civil service jobs if they do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.473" offset="2373256">But as a general matter, strikes against the Government, whether it be state or federal were not characteristic of public employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.747" offset="2410350">The other objective of the Railway Labor Act, it's stated by -- by this Court in the Virginian case was to eliminate the evil of the company union, the very terminology itself indicates that this was not characteristic of public employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.223" offset="2476283">But now I come to the remedy which Congress sought to prevent company unions and strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.956" offset="2523199">Collective bargaining, almost universally, the Court's everywhere hold that collective bargain, the system of establishing wages and hours by the contract method are not characteristic of State or local employment, these matters are set by statute and ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.274" offset="2620479">So, we have two factors here as a actual fact, we didn't have collective bargaining in public employment, and we have numberless cases holding that the public authorities do not possess the authority to establish working conditions by collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.185" offset="2708146">President Roosevelt said in 1937, in a -- in a letter to the national federation of federal employees, "All government employees should realize that the process of collective bargaining as usually understood, cannot be translated -- transplanted into the public service.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.934" offset="2799156">It has its distinct and insurmountable limitations when applied to public personnel management.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.098" offset="2835728">And we had the same problem in the United Mine Workers case, when we had the question of whether the general term "employer" in the Norris-La Guardia Act could or should be applied to the federal government when the federal government was acting as an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.623" offset="2925902">And Mr. Justices Black and Douglas in that case said in -- in applying the term employer or not -- applying it, Congress had never in its history provided a program for fixing wages, hours and working conditions for its employees by collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.356" offset="3012838">Working conditions of government employees had not been the subject of collective bargaining nor been settled as a result of labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.980" offset="3051290">And this is where we place our stand at this point in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.272" offset="3068426">It would require specific congressional language to persuade us that Congress intended to embark upon such a noble program.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.329" offset="3104684">And we submit that the requirement that a State engaged in collective bargaining would be just as much a noble program.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.388" offset="3156929">And to use a colloquialism, I would say that what was source for the "federal goose" in United Mine Workers case, it should be source for the State gander in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.289" offset="3208547">Now, furthermore, when we examined this Act, there are no necessary implications from the scheme of the Act that it should apply to a state carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.880" offset="3266853">By contrast, in United State against California, we have the question as to whether or not the Safety Appliance Act which was in general terms applicable to common carriers engaged in interstate commerce should apply to this very State Belt Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.224" offset="3344280">And the Court at that time looked at the objective of the Act which was to protect the employees and the public from defective appliances in the interstate railroad commerce and the remedy was uniform safety appliances and the Court said, "Well, that -- the need for a uniform safety appliance is just as needful on a State owned cars or privately owned car."</text>
            <text syncTime="839.501" offset="3461413">And then the Court pointed out and said, "This Act then was all -- was national on purpose and all embracing in scope and held this very State Belt Railroad subject to the Act."</text>
            <text syncTime="853.918" offset="3519091">But in this case, we do not have any necessary implications from the plan of the Act itself that a State should be subject to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.518" offset="3553468">The Act doesn't provide for nationwide collective bargaining.</text>

            <text syncTime="896.221" offset="3688260">The report of the National Mediation Board for 20 years shows that there had been -- there are now registered with the Boards some 5190, collective-bargaining contracts made under the Railway Labor Act and that while there have been some national wage movements that these contracts vary from contract to contract, and a matter of fact, you will find that different unions represent the same craft on different properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.662" offset="3818036">So, our point here is that there are -- there is nothing within the -- the plan of this Act which is national in scope and all embracing in purpose so that to keep the State out of it would interfere with -- with a nationwide plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2919.110" offset="11779845">Let's assume that an employee, some of the five who were here represented by me are -- are successful and get a judgment or get an award as it's called in the Adjustment Board for several hundred dollars against the State of California and California says, “We won't comply.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.819" offset="11846614">We then would be permitted under the Railway Labor Act and this is the only thing we could do under the Railway Labor Act to start a suit in a federal District Court on the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.961" offset="11891231">And so, we would have squarely the question which Mr. Justice Frankfurter puts to us now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.195" offset="11916204">Is that a suit against the State which is forbidden by the Eleventh Amendment?</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.223" offset="11936266">That brings up the very question as we see it that the -- it was involved in the Mississippi decision and that's the relation of the Eleventh Amendment to the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.333" offset="11984750">Now, Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution gives to the Congress the right to regulate interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.858" offset="12026755">On the other hand, here is the Eleventh Amendment which says that suits cannot be started against the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.118" offset="12051832">But as we have pointed out in our brief, this Court has many, many times interpreted the Eleventh Amendment, I think, not perhaps in this identical situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.159" offset="12103973">But many times, there has been an interpretation by this Court of the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.883" offset="12126856">The trend of those decisions, it seems to us, is to make the States and their agencies more responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.730" offset="12170324">Specifically, if the State has been guilty of some tortuous conduct in the operation of a proprietary function, it's liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.179" offset="12212120">And many decisions of this Court have upheld that liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.035" offset="12231555">If some state officer is threatening an illegal act and suit maybe brought against him and the Eleventh Amendment is no bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.142" offset="12275963">Now, possibly, it would be said that if the state officer is acting or threatening to act tortuously, it isn't a suit against the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.952" offset="12307205">On the other hand, the recent decisions of this Court have established the liability of all federal -- not all, but at least 40 federal corporations, to suits in spite of the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.957" offset="12383169">It seems to the respondents that when a State chooses to go in to the railroad business, it makes itself like other employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.346" offset="12420786">The operation of the railroad is not one of the typical governmental functions in which -- with which we were concerned at the time of the adoption of the Constitution or of the Eleventh Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3147.632" offset="12693922">And when this Court granted or at -- in connection with the petition for certiorari, that point was waived by the State of California so that, I believe, it's -- it's no longer here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.199" offset="12744182">But be that as it may, if this Court holds, sir, that the Railway Labor Act applies to the State Belt Railroad, then under my view, all California law which is inconsistent with the application of the Railway Labor Act to the operation of this road would be void anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.681" offset="12834147">We have a contract that's already been made that the only question is, will that -- is that contract valid?</text>

            <text syncTime="3215.350" offset="12964760">Well, I think it was made under the Railway Labor Act because I don't believe the Railway Labor Act forces the -- the parties to enter into an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.413" offset="12997047">It strongly encourages them to, but I don't believe that they are coerced into doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.733" offset="13018258">It's been suggested that there are only 11 railroads which are in question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.113" offset="13043858">Actually, as we point out in our brief, there are 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.938" offset="13067160">It may be that Mr. Wineg has in mind that out of the 30, only 11 are actually operated by the State and the others were subject to lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.530" offset="13097462">But we think that the legal principles are the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="3281.010" offset="13227447">And then, I think California in a ex parte manner hands down the terms under which the employees are to work.</text>
