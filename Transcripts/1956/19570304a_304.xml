            <text syncTime="17.592" offset="173746">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.504" offset="189419">This case arises on certiorari to the Third Circuit under the federal wagering tax and presents the question whether a numbers pick-up man is subject to the occupational stamp tax which is imposed upon persons who receive wagers for or on behalf of any person who is subject to the excise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.830" offset="294640">The Third Circuit has decided that a pick-up man is not subject to such a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.082" offset="319718">This decision is in direct conflict with the decision of the Fifth Circuit in Sagonias v. United States, 223 F.2d 146, certiorari denied 350 U.S.840.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.952" offset="387218">To resolve this conflict, the Government petitioned for certiorari which this Court granted.Congress in 1951 enacted two new taxes to deal with professional gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.327" offset="448658">The first of these taxes was the excise tax which is set forth on page 3 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.188" offset="484080">This was a 10% excise task and subdivision (d) of Section 3285 provides that each person who is engaged in the business of accepting wagers shall be liable for and shall pay the tax under this subchapter on all wagers placed with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.088" offset="575718">The legislative history of this Section indicates that it was designed to cover the person who acted in the role of the principal who accepted wagers on his own account and to -- for the risk of profit or loss on such wagers.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.467" offset="653249">The Government concedes that the defendant in this case was not such a person and so the excise tax is not the tax with which we are primarily concerned in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.804" offset="706539">However, the second tax imposed in subchapter B, the occupational tax was imposed on a broader member of persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.354" offset="748753">Section 3290 provides, reading from page three of the Government's brief, "A special tax of $50 per year shall be paid by each person who is liable for tax under subchapter A," interpolating that is each person who functions in the role of the -- of the principal, the banker, the man who has the risk of profit or loss or the statute continues, "Who is engaged in receiving wagers for or on behalf of any person so liable."</text>
            <text syncTime="197.609" offset="893785">And the question in -- in this case is whether a pick-up man is engaged in receiving wagers for or on behalf of such a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.526" offset="933491">The penalty provision is contained in Section 3294, cited on page 4 of the Government's brief and provides that any person who does an act which makes him liable for the tax without having paid such tax shall be fined not less than $1000 nor more than $5000.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.548" offset="1021576">It was for violation of this penalty Section that an information was filed against the defendant in the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.739" offset="1070373">At that trial, which was before a jury, evidence was presented by Philadelphia policemen who are experts in the operation of the numbers racket in the City of Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.541" offset="1125543">The evidence indicated that the practices followed in the numbers game were fairly-well standardized.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.594" offset="1157726">A person wishing to place a -- a wager in the numbers game would not come in direct contact with the banker or the principal, rather he would come in direct contact with the person known as the writer and would tell the writer the three-digit number on wish -- on which he wish to make a bet and would give the money to the writer.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.053" offset="1267545">The writer would keep a book which was a triplicate form book and on this book he would indicate the number which was selected by the player and the amount which the -- was to be wagered.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.109" offset="1323760">The writer would keep for his own records a white copy of this record, would give to the player a tissue carbon copy.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.802" offset="1362631">There would then remain a third copy which is a yellow copy and which would ultimately be turned over to the pick-up man.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.690" offset="1398157">The pick-up man's function was to operate as a liaison between the bank, the principal, and the writers.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.183" offset="1432116">He would daily collect from the writers these yellow pick-up slips and would deliver them to the bank or banker prior to the time towards the end of each day when the winning number would be determined.</text>

            <text syncTime="356.347" offset="1528769">The pick-up man would circulate among various writers.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.146" offset="1543920">The writers would usually be people who would come in contact with the public such as bootblacks or news dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.380" offset="1572864">The pick-up man, working for one bank or banker, would circulate the various writers who also work for that bank and would deliver the slips, which he collects from the various writers, to the bank.</text>

            <text syncTime="400.549" offset="1705566">The practice in Philadelphia at -- at this time which was in October 1952 was for the payoff to be made if -- if a -- a player had selected a number which came out for that day from the bank directly to the writer and from the writer to the -- to the player.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.463" offset="1801174">Evidence was also adduced at the trial that the defendant was apprehended on a state charge by Philadelphia policemen and that he had in his position at that time yellow banker slips of the type I have just described representing 1800 separate bets.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.434" offset="1881109">The defendant admitted that he was engaged in picking up numbers and that he had been so engaged for three months, and said that he was employed at a salary of $40 a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.161" offset="1935966">The defendant was indicted in the local court, the Court of Quarter Sessions in Philadelphia and pled guilty to a charge of maintaining a lottery and was fined.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.750" offset="1982360">Evidence was also adduced to the effect that he did not have the occupational stamp tax, and with this evidence before the jury rendered a verdict of guilty, the Third Circuit by a divided court reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.857" offset="2062817">In disagreeing with the Fifth Circuit and holding that a pick-up man does not receive wagers, the Third Circuit took the view that the placing of a wager by the player and the receipt of the wager were two sides of a single coin and that by the time the pick-up man entered the picture, the wager had been placed.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.039" offset="2155499">And so that rather than receiving a -- a wager, the pick-up man receive merely the record of a wager.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.712" offset="2190190">The Government respectfully submits that the language, purpose, and administrative interpretation of this statute all lead to a -- or support a contrary result.</text>

            <text syncTime="556.368" offset="2328848">Now, do you consider that the person to whom he delivers those records is also subject to the Act and then to carry it down farther through the secretarial force or -- or is there an end of the liability when the pick-up man gets it down there?</text>

            <text syncTime="578.930" offset="2419127">I think, Mr. Chief Justice, there is an end to the liability depending upon the function which is performed by the individual with respect to the -- to the secretary or bookkeeper who performs no role in channeling the wager from the player to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.601" offset="2493733">The Treasury Regulations recognize that the occupational stamp tax would not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.610" offset="2525811">But one might -- and in fact, there exists situations where there are several intermediaries, all of whom serve to -- to transfer the wager from the player to the -- to the bank to -- to avoid apprehension by local and federal authorities, various schemes have been setup through the use of -- of intermediaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.667" offset="2657991">But if the role performed by the -- by the person working for the bank is one of transmission of the wager from the player to the ultimate source, the bank, then the Government submits such a person is -- receives wagers within the meaning of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="681.796" offset="2830608">The Government submits that the key error of the Third Circuit is that emphasis was placed by it on the -- on the player, on the better rather than on the banking side of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.059" offset="2907617">But the statue specifically speaks of persons receiving wagers for or on behalf of any person liable to the excise tax, not on receiving wagers from the betters.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.925" offset="2975117">The difference between this statute and the type of statute which does focus on the better or player is perhaps best demonstrated by reference to the lottery statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.397" offset="3028929">The statute found in 18 U.S.C. Section 1301 which prohibits interstate transportation of lottery tickets.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.058" offset="3071561">That statute prohibits interstate or foreign commerce in, "Any paper, certificate, or instrument purporting to be or to represent a ticket, chance share, or interest in or dependent upon the event of a lottery.”</text>
            <text syncTime="761.858" offset="3150764">This Court in Francis against United States in 188 U.S.375 construed that statute and held that the carrying across state lines of slips, which were the equivalent of the yellow pick-up slips in this case, did not violate the statute because they were not purchases documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.875" offset="3234879">They did not stand as the representative of title to the purchases of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.533" offset="3257553">But in contrast to this statute, the governing factor is not the interest of the purchaser but rather the -- the interest of the banker, the transmission on the banking side of this transaction nor does the statute in speaking of receiving wagers for or on behalf of any person have reference to contract concepts and other provisions in the statute, reference is made to the placing of a wager or the acceptance of a wager.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.365" offset="3396838">Significantly, with respect to this provision of the occupational tax, the broader term receiving wagers is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.684" offset="3442082">And indeed in the -- in the parlance of the numbers rackets, the slips themselves are said to contain the bets.</text>

            <text syncTime="1040.141" offset="4263894">And the -- the situation of the relay of the several intermediaries was considered by Congress, and the -- the report of the Committee on this bill is significant in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.173" offset="4348113">The occupational tax was enacted as a -- an enforcement device for the more important excise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.651" offset="4385938">And the Committee Report in making reference to the occupational tax in language, which appears in page 18 of the Government's brief, stated that the -- the Committee consists of the occupational tax as an integral part of any plan for the taxation of wagers and is essential to the collection and enforcement of such a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.172" offset="4484054">Enforcement of a tax on wagers frequently will necessitate the tracing of transactions to complex business relationships, thus requiring the identification of the various steps involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.554" offset="4545599">For this reason, the Committee Report continues, the bill provides that a person who pays the occupational tax must, as part of his registration, identify those persons who are engaged in receiving wagers for or on his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.976" offset="4611323">And in addition, identify the person whose -- on whose behalf he is engaged in receiving wagers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.454" offset="4641207">The Section 3291 of Title 26 contains the registration provision which is a part of the structure of the occupational stamp tax, and this requires that every person who is subject to the excise tax register the name and place of residence of each person who is engaged in receiving wagers for him or on his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.577" offset="4761684">And if he is engaged in receiving wagers for or on behalf of any person liable for the tax, the excise tax, then he too must register.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.540" offset="4805569">In other words, the consequence of a -- of a holding that a pick-up man does not receive wagers is to remove the pick-up man from the scope of the registration provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.326" offset="4860635">And therefore, defeat the congressional purpose of enabling the tracing of the various transactions in the professional gambling activity so that the excise tax might be enforced.</text>

            <text syncTime="1248.073" offset="5095633">The -- the pick-up man is not as the Third Circuit thought a minor functionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.979" offset="5131264">He is of course the direct emissary of the -- of the banker, a man from a headquarters, Judge McLaughlin called him in -- in dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.542" offset="5197511">And we think that the language of the statute, legislative history that the purpose of the statute all support the conclusion that a pick-up man is a person receiving wagers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1321.666" offset="5390085">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.662" offset="5406072">The Government, I think, has outlined very faithfully the factual situation as developed in the record from the court below and in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.775" offset="5462497">The Government's position seems to be that since the respondent, a pick-up man, is a part of the gambling operation and performs a vital function in that operation that he must therefore fall within the terms of Section 3290 because Congress intended the statute to apply to anyone engaged in any vital phase of the gambling operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.794" offset="5590497">I think this attempts to make the statute do more than what it was passed to do because essentially it is a position that -- that Congress in enacting this statute sought to make it coextensive with the various state statutes which was -- which regulate and punish gambling, and that under this statute, anyone who would be liable for criminal penalties for violation of state gambling statutes would also be liable for the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.957" offset="5743156">I was somewhat interested in the answer which counsel for the Government gave to the question put by the Court as to where he would cutoff this liability for in reading his brief at page 11, it seemed to me that the position taken there was that this tax would apply to anyone who had a part in the gambling operation regardless of what that part was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.965" offset="5867186">If the Government, however, now seeks to limit the application then I think we must be faced with the question of whether or not the limitation, which it now concedes, makes any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.741" offset="5922356">Now, first of all, I think we must consider just what it was that the respondent here did and what part he does perform in this gambling operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.344" offset="5964779">He has no contact whatsoever with the numbers player, the person who makes the bet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.172" offset="5996022">He doesn't carry any money either from the writer to the bank or from the bank back to the writer and eventually to the numbers player.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.174" offset="6040116">All he does is handle the slips, the records which are made of the gambling transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.557" offset="6073553">And in doing so his function is that of a messenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.217" offset="6088286">He circulates between the bank and the writer and brings records which concededly are necessary in the operation of this lottery but which, we submit, have nothing to do with the wager as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.915" offset="6162996">And I think that in analysis of the statute makes this clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.616" offset="6189850">In the first place, we must notice that under Section 3285 (a) which deals with the excise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.944" offset="6223182">This is a tax imposed -- the excise tax is a tax imposed on wagers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.411" offset="6248991">Obviously, it makes the bet the important thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.590" offset="6265710">In discussing the liability for the excise tax, it's again the liability of anyone who accepts wagers and wagers is again the central word which determines liability for the excise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.840" offset="6330702">In determining credits against the excise tax, again it refers to the laying off of wagers by one person who accepts them initially with another person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.648" offset="6382007">Finally, it defines a wager as any wager placed in a lottery conducted for profit, focusing therefore on the transaction which gives rise to the bet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.525" offset="6441462">The transaction by means of which the numbers player on the one hand and the bank on the other hand become committed, and the agency by which this transaction is consummated is not the pick-up man, it is the writer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.201" offset="6508126">It is in this sense, we submit, that when the statute talks of receiving wagers on behalf of a banker that the term is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.592" offset="6557759">The person who receives the wager is the person through whose agency the wagering transaction is consummated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.714" offset="6594226">From that point on, the wager is completed and from that point on, any dealings with whatever results is not a dealing with the wager.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.844" offset="6634768">What you're doing from that point on is conducting a bookkeeping function insofar as the bank and its operations are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.987" offset="6675310">Now, when Congress passed Section 3290, it carefully chose its words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.722" offset="6706239">Had it desired to make the liability for the occupational tax extend beyond the person who has the contact with the better, beyond the numbers writer who admittedly is subject to the occupational tax, it would not have used the word "receiving wagers."</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.832" offset="6798712">He could have accomplished this by saying any employee of the banker or any agent of the banker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.415" offset="6829014">And essentially, what the Government argues is that because the pick-up man is an agent of the bank and performs as, that agent, a vital function then he must be subject to the Act because Congress wanted to get that anyone who performed a vital function in this operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.030" offset="6931519">But we submit as the Third Circuit held that in considering the interpretation of the phrase "receiving wagers," we must consider that we cannot just isolate the word "receive" and say as the Government does receive has many, many meanings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.481" offset="7013334">We must focus upon what it is that has been received and the statute very explicitly says it's the wager.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.876" offset="7046875">And then by reference to the definition of wager which consists of the placing of the wager in the lottery pool, we see that the receiving of the wager and the placing of the wager are, as the court below put it, two sides of the same coin and when the wager has been placed, the receipt of it has been accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.189" offset="7148126">And from then on we are not any longer dealing with a receipt of wager.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.846" offset="7178742">Now, the Government says that to do this, we give it this interpretation, would defeat the congressional purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.776" offset="7226493">And in the Sagonias case, the case which arose in the Fifth Circuit, where they held that the pick-up man was liable for the occupational tax, the same argument was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.585" offset="7281664">But a reading of the Fifth Circuit case would indicate that that Court had difficulty coming to its conclusion because as I read it they admitted that the express wording of the statute didn't cover the pick-up man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.410" offset="7337044">It clearly covered the numbers writer, but not the pick-up man.</text>

            <label>Mr. Raymond J. Bradley</label>
            <text syncTime="1819.535" offset="7381556">The banker is because the statute specifically makes him liable, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.034" offset="7399528">Because in Section 3290, the statute says that the occupational tax shall be paid by everyone who is liable for the excise tax, which is the banker, and anyone who receives wagers on his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.004" offset="7459401">And I think there again it's indicative of what the meaning of the term “receiving wagers” is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.871" offset="7490853">Because to get the banker in, they specifically said he is in because he is one who is liable to the excise tax, and then they say also those receiving wagers on his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.276" offset="7548426">If they weren't using receiving wagers in the restricted sense that I have used it, they could have said and that anybody who receives wagers that would then if -- if their intent was to include the banker under those words, then you might say that receiving wagers has the interpretation which the Government seeks to give it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.271" offset="7640482">But Congress used these words “accepting” and “receiving” I believe in a very restricted sense as the wording of this Act indicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.107" offset="7679770">And as the Fifth Circuit in the Sagonias case, I believe, was forced to admit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.241" offset="7700355">And then faced with the -- the -- their own interpretation that the express wording did not cover the pick-up man then they had reference to some broad general policy which they said was inherent in this Act and said that unless we included the pick-up man, then we would defeat this broad general purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.859" offset="7810800">Now, on -- in his argument, counsel for the Government says that when the pick-up man comes to the bank and delivers these slips, which he has, to some other functionary of the gambling operation that that second functionary is not liable for this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.110" offset="7899826">He gets the very same thing that the writer got, he gets the slips.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.604" offset="7917798">And with them, he performs certain functions necessary to the operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.978" offset="7939323">Now, they said the pick-up man who has only the slips is liable, but the person to whom he delivers the very same things which make him liable is not liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.569" offset="7989687">Now, the Treasury takes that position too in its regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.149" offset="8011943">We submit that that distinction cannot be justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.691" offset="8030124">How you can say that one who handles the slips must pay the tax and another who handles the very same thing need not pay the tax is something which is difficult to understand and appreciate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.597" offset="8097729">The Government, I think, is relying basically on the dictum which occurred in the case Daley versus -- versus the United States, a decision in the First Circuit in 231 F.2d 123.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.807" offset="8166588">There, the Court said that in approving a charge which was directed not at this question but at another issue in the case, the Court said that anyone who has anything to do with the numbers operation is engaged in the business and in conducting a lottery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.591" offset="8245687">Now, if that interpretation were taken, it would make the pick-up man not only liable for the occupational tax but liable also for the excise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.920" offset="8303052">Now, the Government concedes that he is not liable for the excise tax but they would like to use that same theory, which they say is wrong, to impose liability for the occupational tax which is involved here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2931.855" offset="11830836">But we submit, sir, that even when you take a look at the Treasury Regulations, although the example which was cited in the Government's brief and also which is set forth on page 4 of our brief, covers the pick-up man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.639" offset="11905964">It does so, it seems to me, by just pulling itself up by its own bootstraps and assuming that what he gets is the receipt of the wager and that's the very question that we have involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.511" offset="11961448">Now, if you look at other sections of the Act -- of the regulations, particularly the Section 325.24, which is set forth in our brief on page 2 and 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.268" offset="12044413">I believe that the Treasury there accepts our proposition that the receipt and placing of wagers are two sides of the same coin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.683" offset="12082134">Now, I believe also that in the first example given in Section 325.41 of the regulation which says -- which excludes the bookkeeper as a receiver of wagers, even though the bookkeeper gets the very same thing which the -- the pick-up man gets is an inconsistency which just can't be explained and which, it seems to me, indicates that the Treasury Regulation is a force attempt to read into the statute more than was there and more than what Congress intended to be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.598" offset="12237720">And therefore, what we -- and the fact that the statute was reenacted in the substantially the same language throws little light on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.964" offset="12283277">Although it has sometimes been said that reenactment of a statute following the promulgation of a regulation indicates that Congress approved of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.020" offset="12339493">That has generally been the case where the regulation has been of longstanding, where it was well-known, where it had been subject to court interpretation, and where it was brought home to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.020" offset="12387453">If you look at the legislative reports which accompanied the 1954 Revenue Code, which reenacted the statute, you'll see that there's just this one sentence passing reference to the gambling taxes then lead to the effect that we have reenacted the gambling taxes to say that when Congress did that, it took this Treasury interpretation and put it into the gambling tax statutes goes entirely too far in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.462" offset="12529246">So what we come back to is the statute which is where we started.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.422" offset="12549099">And we submit that if you stick with the statute and avoid this rather easy way of getting at it by saying, “Oh, let's bring everybody in because Congress was trying to hit everybody in this lane, you stay with the statute, you can only come to the result which the court below bridge.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.485" offset="12633318">And since this is a statute which is both a taxing measure and a criminal measure, there is no justification for taking this attitude of broadening it beyond its plain terms and extending it to situations which were not contemplated and which do not fit in with the statute taken as a whole.</text>
