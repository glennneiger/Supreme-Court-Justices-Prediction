            <text syncTime="22.962" offset="195271">Honorable Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.191" offset="212093">Petitioner has come before this Court and complain that the Government does not have a right of appeal in the instance where the District Court has granted a motion to suppress evidence after indictment and pending trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.715" offset="298193">In this case, if it please the Court, the petitioners has filed a motion to suppress evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.863" offset="334869">There is indication in the respondent's brief that there was also a motion to return property.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.562" offset="369664">I might say to the Court that the two other defendants that is below, the motions having been denied as to them, the Government for some reason or other chose to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.237" offset="416371">There was no appeal taken from the granting of one of the motions in the lower court not respecting these petitioners here with respect to the return of property ceased from some premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.056" offset="471646">So, as will be seen from a reading of the decision of the Court of Appeals, at page 31 of the record, that this case comes before this Court clearly on the question of the supression of evidence ceased from the person of the two petitioners here.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.653" offset="557955">The Government, however, claims that under section 1291 of Title 28, they have a right of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.285" offset="600482">Our contention is clear, we think, that there is no statutory right granted to the Government in the instance of the interlocutory order.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.977" offset="643323">We claim that the order in this instance is interlocutory and we rely up on our proposition for the opinion rendered by this Honorable Court in the case of Cogen versus United States, the Cobbledick case and of the recent case in 1955 of Bodinger versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.317" offset="724616">The Government also urges in their brief that a local statute which is Title 23, section 105 of the District of Columbia Code entitles them to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.336" offset="780727">I respectfully submit to the Court on behalf of the petitioners that that grants them no relief because, first of all, Title 23, section 105 was passed upon by this Court in the case of United States versus Evans.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.597" offset="853765">And I think that's to be found at 213 U.S.reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.230" offset="876335">In addition, there is the section 17 -- Title 17, section 102 of the D.C.Code of which limits in the same fashion as section 1292 of Title 28 limits the right to appeal from interlocutory orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.991" offset="959300">Moreover, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit did not rely upon the local statute, that is either Title 23 or Title 17 of the D.C.Code to justify their decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.652" offset="1034010">They squarely state that the decision of this case rests upon a prior decision of Cefaratti versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.623" offset="1073821">We sought a certiorari to this Court, but because of the matter of time, the petition not having been filed in time, it was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.736" offset="1114363">Now, in that case, they state that they rely squarely upon the decisions of this Court in the Stack, Cohen and Swift cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.656" offset="1149994">I respectfully submit to the Court that the Stack case, the Cohen case and the Swift cases, all of them dealt with a civil matter and dealt with matters that were entirely independent of the issue in trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.713" offset="1218226">For instance, the Stack case as this Court will recall dealt with the matter of bond pending of person's appeal, a bail bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.797" offset="1250513">In the other case, it was a matter of the attachment dealing with the -- an admiralty manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.338" offset="1272769">And in the third, it was a matter of the posting of security of cause during the course of an appeal where there was a stock, a derivative action stockholder suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="319.933" offset="1383111">Now, the Government as we see it and we urge upon this Court is in a rather anomalous position.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.831" offset="1414666">In order to rely upon finality as was set forth that is the -- the several bases on which finality might rest as determined in the Stack or of the Swift cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.678" offset="1482062">There is the fourth one which was not mentioned in the Cefaratti case.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.708" offset="1498154">And that is the one urging that the matter must be independent of the issue and trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.337" offset="1528769">Now, the Government attempts, I think rather feebly to straddle that issue by suggesting that this is independent of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.170" offset="1560012">However, on the other hand, they urge upon this Court as they did in the court below, that without this particular evidence, they are unable to go forward successfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.369" offset="1612884">We state that the failure or that is the paucity of their evidence is of no moment and we believe as the courts have held in the decisions I indicated to the Court like the Cohen case for instance, the Bodinger case and the Cobbledick case.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.658" offset="1689997">Now, incidentally, I did not cite -- I did not cite the Cobbledick case in our brief but the Cobbledick case is to be found at 309 U.S.beginning at page 323.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.097" offset="1747780">I might suggest that that was an opinion, I believe written by his Honor Judge Frank -- Justice Frankfurter.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.108" offset="1783829">So, as we see the case on the facts as they are at issue here, and as Mr. Justice Harlan has indicated, now the sole issue then is one of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.658" offset="1833984">We say that there is no finality here that this evidence which has been suppressed by the Court is necessary by the Government's own confession and intercourses a necessary part in the whole trial procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="507.873" offset="2134915">That does not go to the question of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.368" offset="2148812">As a matter of fact, I think that lends more to the suggestion that it is an integral part of the trial proceeding itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.863" offset="2174830">And it seems to me that is therefore entirely consistent with the pronouncement of this Court in the Bodinger case against the honorable decisions for instance on the one hand and the allowance of piecemeal mere litigation on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.688" offset="2238151">And there would fundamentally be the constitutional issue involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.423" offset="2265109">For instance as of this case, as you will notice from the record, we have been over three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.125" offset="2291858">So, therefore, the trial, the right of the speedy trial, the constitutional right to a speedy trial is necessarily involved in this issue because at any moment, in further answer to your question, that the Government felt and this is a conclusion left up entirely to the Government that they felt that they would be incapable of proceeding further successfully, than they would on -- on the occasion of an adverse ruling than they would want to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.615" offset="2413798">Certainly, this Court can appreciate the confusion that would reign in our appellate courts under such circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.924" offset="2439084">And also the confusion inhabited would prevail in the instance of the matter of trial, of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.848" offset="2466774">It would, as it has been done here, this trial -- the trial of these people has been held up for approximately three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.876" offset="2494882">I don't think that is consistent with the pronouncements of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.556" offset="2513586">We say that the Government in this instance does not come within the purview of the -- the statute, of the statute which regulates the matter of appeal on behalf of the Government and coming further to your question that it must come within the area of finality, that this being an integral part of the trial proceeding itself does not come properly as a final order or decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.472" offset="2621210">It's interlocutory therefore in the character and that the Government may not appeal from it.</text>

            <text syncTime="646.051" offset="2687561">In the context of this case there are two prerequisites to the appealability of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.057" offset="2711594">In the first place, there must be an existence of statute which confers appellate jurisdiction on the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.505" offset="2737403">Secondly, the decision from which the appeal is sought must be -- must qualify that final order.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.698" offset="2762167">And so far as the statutory jurisdiction is concerned, we rely primarily on the District of Columbia statute to which I will come in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.005" offset="2795395">We also rely on the section of the United States Code that is the general appeal section of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.532" offset="2825488">But both of those statutes require as a prerequisite to the operation that there be a final order, the final decision as distinguished from interlocutory decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.713" offset="2870209">And so, I'd like to address myself to that question first as to whether we have a final order in a decision which supresses the Government's evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.164" offset="2912005">Now, basically, there are two criteria which are found in the decisions for determining, and for measuring whether a decision measures up to the test of finality.</text>
