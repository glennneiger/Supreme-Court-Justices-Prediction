            <text syncTime="15.899" offset="166954">If the Court please, petitioner in this case is a 72-year old alien, a native of Germany.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.938" offset="199137">He was admitted to this country for permanent residence back in 1914 and he has resided here ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.581" offset="233723">He was ordered deported under the provisions of the Internal Security Act of 1950, which provides for the deportation of aliens who are former members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.530" offset="285445">A finding made by the Immigration Service in this case was that the alien here had been a member of the Communist Party for about six months in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.222" offset="340302">This finding of membership was based entirely upon a voluntary statement which was made by the petitioner under oath to an officer of the Immigration Service back in January of 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.218" offset="404250">That statement is set out in the record at pages 25 to 32.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.531" offset="425462">And we have reproduced all the relevant portions of that statement in our brief from pages 401.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.280" offset="464541">I wish at this time to bring to the Court's attention the most prevalent portions of that statement which will come up in -- across my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.646" offset="505919">On page 5, the question was put to the alien, “What was the purpose of your joining the Communist Party?”</text>
            <text syncTime="109.903" offset="543013">Answer, “The purpose was probably this, it seemed to me that it came hand in hand, the Communist Party and the fight for bread.”</text>

            <text syncTime="125.631" offset="605915">Sorry, it's -- it appears at the record on page 25 and I'm reading from my brief at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.655" offset="637994">It seemed to me like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.811" offset="642591">Let's put it this way that the Communist Party and the Workers' Alliance had one aim, to get something to eat for the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.272" offset="676446">Turning then to the brief on page 78, the following appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.678" offset="694105">Question, “Were you an active worker in the Communist Party?”</text>

            <text syncTime="158.733" offset="738304">“Were you an active worker in the Communist Party?”</text>
            <text syncTime="161.397" offset="748962">Answer, “The only active work I did was running the bookstore for a while.”</text>
            <text syncTime="167.078" offset="771636">Question, “Where did you run a bookstore?”</text>
            <text syncTime="170.553" offset="785533">Answer, “241 Market in Minneapolis.”</text>
            <text syncTime="173.280" offset="796505">Question, “What sort of bookstore was it?”</text>
            <text syncTime="177.148" offset="811969">Answer, “Oh, all kinds of literature, all kinds of writers in the whole world.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.976" offset="831300">Strachey, Marx, Lenin's writing and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.114" offset="843839">Socialism and all that stuff.” Question, “Did you own the bookstore?”</text>
            <text syncTime="190.149" offset="864005">Answer, “No.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.832" offset="866722">I didn't get a penny there.”</text>
            <text syncTime="193.711" offset="878216">Question, “What was the arrangement there?”</text>
            <text syncTime="196.233" offset="888351">Answer, “I was kind of a salesman in there, but the Communist Party ran it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="201.206" offset="908204">Question, “You secure this employment through your membership in the Communist Party?”</text>
            <text syncTime="209.719" offset="942268">Answer, “Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="205.740" offset="942164">Question, “Was this store an official outlet for communist literature?”</text>
            <text syncTime="211.714" offset="950209">And then finally, turning to page 10 of our brief, I wish to read the following excerpt.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.609" offset="981765">Question, “Again referring to your joining in the Communist Party in 1935, was this motivated by dissatisfaction in living under a democracy?”</text>
            <text syncTime="230.500" offset="1025337">Answer, “No, not by that, just a matter of having no jobs at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.430" offset="1053132">Everybody around me had the idea that we had to fight for something to eat and clothes and shelter.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.399" offset="1080926">We were not thinking then, anyways, the fellows around me of overthrowing anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.079" offset="1103705">We wanted something to eat and something to crawl into."</text>
            <text syncTime="253.892" offset="1118960">Question, “You say, fight for something to eat and crawl into.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.760" offset="1138395">What do you mean by that term?”</text>
            <text syncTime="260.762" offset="1146441">Answer, “We had to go and ask those who had it, that was the courthouse at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.392" offset="1172982">We petitioned city, state and national government.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.170" offset="1188028">We did and we succeeded.We finally got unemployment laws and a certain budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.337" offset="1212688">Even at the few Communist meetings I attended, nothing was ever said about overthrowing anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.737" offset="1238288">All they talked about was fighting for the daily needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.665" offset="1254066">That is why we never thought much of joining those parties in these days -- in those days."</text>
            <text syncTime="294.823" offset="1282696">Two questions are presented by this case, set out in the statement of questions presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.756" offset="1310386">The first is whether under the evidence here, the petitioner was more than a nominal membership -- member of the Communist Party, and whether since under our contention, we argue he was no more than a nominal member.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.534" offset="1365556">He comes within the deportation statute of 1950, as the term "member" was defined in Galvan.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.430" offset="1393142">And the second question is whether the provision of the Internal Security Act of 1950, which was relied upon here by the deportation service is constitutional despite the decision of this Court in Galvan which sustained the constitutionality of that Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Rein</label>
            <text syncTime="365.554" offset="1565550">-- that issue the case is entirely different, I guess.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.938" offset="1579133">We do not ask you to overrule Galvan in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.640" offset="1589896">We ask you to overrule Galvan only insofar as Galvan sustained the constitutionality of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.273" offset="1612466">We think on the issue to which I'm going to address myself now, the issue of nominal membership, we believe that Galvan has authority in our favor and would require a reversal of the deportation order.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.834" offset="1670666">The Galvan case, which was the case sustaining the constitutionality of this provision, construe the statute as not applying to former members of the Communist Party who had been only nominal members.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.298" offset="1736600">The Court gives no precise definition to that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.119" offset="1755826">I gather because in the experience of the legislative history or previous decisions of courts, no precise definition was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.303" offset="1796577">It referred essentially to the legislative history of a provision which was enacted in 1951 at which time Congress passed in clarifying of -- the clarifying act as to the meaning of member as used in the Act of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.416" offset="1913083">Galvan established at least these propositions clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.078" offset="1939728">One, it is not necessary to fall within the orbit of the 1950 Act that the alien have knowledge of the Communist Party's alleged advocacy of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.400" offset="2000959">It is necessary however that he has some awareness of the platform and purposes of the Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.666" offset="2030007">He must be aware that the organization he has joined is known as the Communist Party which operates as a distinct and active political organization, and his relationship with the organization must be of a character that you could characterize it as more than nominal.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.140" offset="2111927">The guide post was the legislative debate, and the only guide post referred to in Galvan was the legislative debate in 1951 revolving around the clarifying provision with regards to the meaning of the term member.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.510" offset="2177442">That Act was introduced, at least that clarifying amendment was introduced by Congress because of devoid of the original office of the Internal Security Act to Senator McCarran and Congressman Walter.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.696" offset="2226134">But the Attorney General had been applying the term member wrongfully as applying to every kind of member.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.308" offset="2256645">And they felt that not only do they not issue to be so applied but they stated in the cross of the debate that had never been to their attention, that it -- that it should be so applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.261" offset="2308368">The clarifying amendment expressly provided that the statute will not cover those who had joined the Communist Party when they were children or they became members by operation of law or to obtain the necessities of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.940" offset="2375137">This Court's opinion recognized however, that these three categories of nominal membership were not the sole categories of nominal membership intended by Congress and that there could be other instances of nominal membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.723" offset="2442219">The Government recognized it isn't well in its brief and it recognizes the force of Galvan in creating the caveat as to the nature of membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.351" offset="2492792">It suggests, that is the base to point out, the meaning of that caveat to refer more fully to the Senate debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.239" offset="2528319">We agree with him in that, but we think here, we will find that the debate is somewhat confusing.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.903" offset="2558934">It is not in itself too clear a guide because different Senators said not really different things but somewhat vague things.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.146" offset="2595924">We suggest and we believe properly so that the language are set forth on page 25 of the Government's brief and the quotation from Senator Ferguson is as good a guide as there might be to what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.026" offset="2659453">Senator Ferguson incidentally was one of the Senators who introduced an amendment to this clarifying amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.479" offset="2689337">The amendment originally introduced by Senator McCarran, were not have applied to members of so-called Communist organizations but only the Fascists and Nazi organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.921" offset="2739075">Senator Ferguson suggested that the amendment apply to members of any kind of organization that came within the terms of the 1950 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.858" offset="2774810">Senator Ferguson in giving what he had in mind said as follows at page 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.252" offset="2796335">Mr. Ferguson, “That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.854" offset="2806784">The amendment would exclude all those who were Communist by conviction, what we might call mentally communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.115" offset="2839803">But it would not exclude those who really in effect never have been what I call mentally communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.516" offset="2869478">Those who's Communist affiliation was nominal or involuntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.025" offset="2891421">“Thus clearly, so far as Senator Ferguson was concerned, the attachment to the Communist Party must be something more than just membership.</text>

            <text syncTime="816.257" offset="3368417">In other words, the deletion -- the clarifying amendment had in parenthesis except with regard to Communist organizations, and the proposed amendment which was accepted by Senator McCarran was to delete that.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.519" offset="3417422">So his comments go to the original meaning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.279" offset="3436440">According to the debate also, and I think as the Government contends and we agree, the purpose that Congress had in mind in indicating this was to say that they wished the term member to have the same meaning in this statute, in the 1950 statute that the term member had had a deportation statutes as a result of judicial decision prior to the passage of the 1950 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.134" offset="3543960">And that what they were doing for the 1951 qualification was to restore that meaning to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.453" offset="3577187">This leaves us with the consideration as what guides did we have in previous judicial decisions defining the term member.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.158" offset="3615953">There were no decisions in this Court that are all relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.052" offset="3631626">The only decision that was cited by the Committee which brought up the 1951 Amendment, and the only decision that I am familiar with to discuss this term in any detail whatsoever is the case of Colyer v. Skeffington which was cited in -- by Congress at the time and also relied upon by this Court in the Galvan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.533" offset="3729533">Now, the Government attempts to confine the Colyer case to a very narrow situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.915" offset="3755029">It quotes from one excerpt of the Colyer case which was one of the situations before.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.071" offset="3775613">I should briefly say that that case, before I go into it, involved the deportation of a whole mass group of aliens, I think something like 40 or 50 under a statute of 1918 which made one deportable for being a member of an organization that advocated the overthrow of the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.491" offset="3869341">The issue came up in that case with regard to all 40 of these whether on the evidence they were members of that organization as well as many other issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.767" offset="3910405">And the Court discussed that question and found that a number of them were not members of that organization for different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.085" offset="3947708">The Government in its brief sets out only one rule, one quotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.231" offset="3964322">That is the group and the Court said, we're not members of the Communist Party because they had originally belonged to the Socialist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.279" offset="3996505">The Socialist Party had changed its name and they had just become members of the Communist Party by virtue of the change of name of the Socialist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.983" offset="4031300">But the Court discussed other groups as well and its broad principle was not limited to that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.251" offset="4056377">Its broad principle as set out by the Court at page 72 of its opinion, it said that the membership must be -- and the term it used was a real membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.893" offset="4102980">We think that would mean a membership with some significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.500" offset="4117400">It refer to one other case which it reversed where the alien had joined the Communist Party, solely because of his interest in the social activities of the organization because he found it a good place to -- people who spoke his language, he can learn to read and write, and he learned arithmetic there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.960" offset="4195244">He had no interest in politics whatsoever but he had joined the Communist Party, had joined it not -- he had joined it consciously and notably.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.127" offset="4235891">The Government would seem to say that nominal means no more than it would be unconscious or unknowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.550" offset="4257520">But there was a case in Colyer where he joined it, but joined it with no notion of what the nature of the organization was at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.694" offset="4290121">Thinking of it being an organization without regard to its political aspects, or the Court there found that that was a nominal member, Judge Anderson in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.212" offset="4340172">There was one other case where the evidence against the alien showed only a Communist Party membership part with notation of dues but no other evidence further connecting this alien with the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.615" offset="4393880">Now, the Court felt that that was not -- that that did not make him a member within the terms of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.532" offset="4421465">I say to the Court that on the basis of the representations made by the Government here that what was meaningful was the prior interpretation of the term member by the Courts before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.344" offset="4468799">The Colyer case is really the only case which would serve as a guide first post.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.948" offset="4491160">And under the doctrine of the Colyer case, the -- the alien here certainly was no more than a nominal member.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.291" offset="4536508">I turn now on the basis of -- consider the basis of these principles to the particular facts in this case, I think at the very least, the concept of nominal membership must be taken to establish that once the Government proves that an alien has been a member of the Communist Party, it has not proven its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.075" offset="4615711">It must prove something more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.761" offset="4626369">Now, Galvan said that something more does not necessarily have to show knowledge of the unlawful advocacy of the Communist Party but it's not enough either merely to show nominal membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.719" offset="4674226">There is an area in between which this Court has not yet, perhaps sketched out sufficiently where nominal membership ends and where actual and meaningful membership for the purposes of the deportation statute begins.</text>

            <text syncTime="1622.957" offset="6595166">We say therefore that if nominal membership means anything, it means that there must be shown some minimal activity and that the sole activity shown here of having been a clerk in the bookstore for a brief period is not enough to take the alien out of the concept of nominal membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.530" offset="6669458">We argue also that he comes within two explicit exceptions set out in Galvan which would take him out of the clause of nominal membership.</text>

            <text syncTime="1664.888" offset="6762872">He joined to obtain the necessities of life because of the fact that he felt it was necessary, at least in his view, that he joined in order to get something to eat, and clothes and shelter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.940" offset="6823163">That was his reason for joining and that comes within one -- one of the express exceptions as set forth in the clarification of the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.916" offset="6855032">Secondly, he comes within the provision as set fort in the quotation from Colyer against Skeffington and the Galvan case that he had no real knowledge of the platform and purposes of the Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.784" offset="6906546">And this is significant as to what he said about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.951" offset="6923160">He said, "Even if the few communist meetings I attended, nothing was ever said about overthrowing anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="1721.745" offset="6990346">I submit that it is clear he never really gave any consideration to the question of the nature of the Communist Party as a political organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.653" offset="7029948">He viewed it only as a mechanism through which he could -- he and others could get unemployment relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.032" offset="7059519">He never inquired at least as it appears here from his testimony, his statement which is all that is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.716" offset="7082193">He never inquired further as to the character of the organization, what his political position was in on any matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="2432.751" offset="9834350">I do want to say one point, one further remark before I leave this, before I go to the question of constitutionality, and that is that we have in our reply brief cases in this Court and we quote from them indicating that where there is any ambiguity upon the findings of the Immigration Service, the responsibility of this Court is not to resolve or clarify that but to send it back to the administrative agency to go and do the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.708" offset="9954200">And I think that as a minimum, that is the relief we'll be entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.673" offset="9970082">On the question now of the constitutionality of the statute, a lot of -- I'll address myself first to the question of what we think adopt into the Galvan is, as we read the decision in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.345" offset="10040717">And we read it as holding that the deportation power of Congress is to all practical effect without any constitutional limitations except for the one single limitation of the requirement of procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.648" offset="10101948">That is certainly not limited by substantive due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.774" offset="10118457">It is not limited by the provisions of the ex post facto clause, by the Bill of Attainder Clause or by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.932" offset="10167150">We argue in our brief that such a view is not supported either by a precedent or by logic and hence, should be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.689" offset="10206124">Now, the Government, quite interestingly enough in its brief, thinks that Galvan says too much in that respect also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.138" offset="10247920">And right off, it disagrees with us as to what we think that Galvan falls because it says that it would be wrong for this Court to hold that there are no constitutional limitations on the deportation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.535" offset="10313540">It argues that substantive due process is a limitation on the exercise of Congress' power to deploy and that a deportation statute can be upheld only where it constitutes a reasonable classification of currently undesirable aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.765" offset="10382399">And it then asserts, and I say it's not in the Galvan opinion, that that is what Galvan did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.206" offset="10404237">That Galvan upheld the statute on the ground that it was a reasonable classification of deportable aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.473" offset="10445302">But we think the Government's concession in this case requires this Court to reexamine Galvan because certainly, Galvan did not look at the constitutional issues that way.</text>

            <text syncTime="2698.008" offset="10895444">And then the Court went on to say that, although it was entitled to ask that but the Court was not going to ask that question or answer it either because they said policies retaining to the entry of aliens and there right to remain here are peculiarly concerned with the political conduct of Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2977.168" offset="12012022">The courts opinion said, "Certainly, we cannot say that this classification by Congress as to a basis as to be violative of due process and therefore beyond the power of Congress."</text>

            <text syncTime="3008.617" offset="12137827">Well, I'm sorry I didn't mean that, Your Honor.[Laughs]</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.224" offset="12156217">But to leave that aside, I think, Your Honor, and my time is running out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.147" offset="12184012">I wish to refer to the fact that to leave Galvan as it is that we do discuss in our brief the fact that the cases which were decided by this Court at least prior to the risk he honors, do not support the proposition stated in Galvan about deportation statutes being of a separate character than other statutes, and therefore, being given a separate kind of approach with regard to the Due Process Clause or other provisions of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.872" offset="12334895">As a matter a fact and I don't have time to review those cases fully.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.228" offset="12352240">Well, I think an examination of those cases in terms of their decisions about the generalities established only these propositions that Congress has an unlimited power to exclude aliens and including the power to deport for illegal entry, that it may employ the expulsion power to implement the exclusion policy or to remove resident aliens who have demonstrated by their conduct that their continued presence in the country would be harmful, and that legislation so limited is not punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.644" offset="12513991">Generalizations to the effect that the expulsion power is unlimited and that deportation power is not a punishment, are not supported by the decisions and a contradicted by contrary generalizations in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.772" offset="12574490">The most recent contrary generalization was the opinion of this Court in Jordan against De George.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.461" offset="12601240">Certainly, prior to hierarchy orders, there have been no decision which upheld any controllable statute or involved any of the features, the objectionable features of the 1950 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.436" offset="12657142">There was accordingly no warrant and I'm sorry to say that these issues were foreclosed by prior decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.106" offset="12691832">I think that if we consider that the issue was a fresh one and that the slate was clean at least so far as the 1950 statute was concerned and if we test the statute on orthodox constitutional principles, I think the statute must fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.880" offset="12770931">It must fall first because of its conflict with the substantive Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.995" offset="12807398">The present statute is invalid because it is special legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.686" offset="12834147">It provides for the expulsion of a group of people not in terms of culpable characteristics or general descriptions but by name.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.124" offset="12879914">Significantly, the only time that Congress had been for more in a statute of a similar nature and that was fact about 1940, a statute calling for the deportation of Harry Bridges by name.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.346" offset="12936756">That statute was rejected by the Congress specifically by the Senate, specifically on constitutional grounds that Congress did not have the power to pass a deportation statute which can deport one by name.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.625" offset="12997883">This statute is no different in principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.032" offset="13015542">It just has a larger group.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.631" offset="13029857">In addition, it is no answer to suggest that the Government does, that the statute was based upon evidence considered by Congress as to the character of the Communist Party, that the Communist Party was a tenacious organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.566" offset="13093595">The due process means anything, and if it prohibits special legislation, it prohibits condemnation by legislative fiat without regard to whether that is reasonable or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.145" offset="13147930">Because if the legislature cannot pass such a statute, it is not give -- if the legislature passed such a statute, it is not giving due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.260" offset="13184397">And to consider the question of whether they had evidence before them does not meet the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.196" offset="13208116">Because you could have evidence to justify any special legislation, deportation against Harry Bridges or under the same logic, deportation or statutes could be enacted exclusively against other groups in the community such as Catholics or Negroes on the ground that there is evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.246" offset="13300381">The statute is irrational moreover and therefore in conflict with the substantive Due Process Clause for other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.846" offset="13330787">The general justification given for the power of Congress to expel aliens is that it enables the State to rid itself of undesirable alien residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.680" offset="13382092">That is the general theory given for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3334.083" offset="13439666">No, Your Honor, because anarchist is not a name, anarchist is a description of a category of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.584" offset="13469759">This is not -- it maybe unreasonable but my argument addresses only to the fact that this three-fourths people who are members of the Communist Party by name without regard to what the Communist Party does or doesn't do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.301" offset="13516570">This statute makes it a matter of indifference as to what the nature of the Communist Party is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.060" offset="13535587">It fixed them out by name, and that's the point so the -- the provision about anarchists would have no -- no reference to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.186" offset="13568084">This doesn't explore -- this doesn't expel people who believe in anarchism or who believe in communism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.366" offset="13592848">This only expels people who are members of the Communist Party, making all other things irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.475" offset="13629315">The present statute is even more irrational because it disregards all the considerations that would be relevant in determining whether or not the particular alien is undesirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.927" offset="13683127">It ignores for example the alien's lack of knowledge of the evil nature of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.896" offset="13714996">It ignores the nature of his activities in the organization, whether these activities were innocuous, commendable, or even when they were non-existent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.330" offset="13752717">It ignores the length of his membership or it ignores how long ago it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.819" offset="13778631">In addition to that, it exhibits no interest whatsoever in what manner of a man the alien was at that time of the action of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.734" offset="13818337">But this -- if this was a rational statute based upon expelling undesirable aliens, currently undesirable aliens which apparently is a theory of it, this would be the relevant factors which it would discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.360" offset="13880822">But the statute ignores all of these relevant factors which would be reasonable in its application and it applies its policy instead on a basically irrational factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.878" offset="13942888">Certainly, as applied to the particular petitioner here, the statute is clearly irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.689" offset="13966085">Because on this record the petitioner is being deported solely because 20 years ago in a different political climate he was an active in a movement for relief of the unemployed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3510.311" offset="14144658">It would still have the objectionable feature that it's a special legislation because it applies to a group without regard to its culpable characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.271" offset="14176423">Because if one says the Communist Party then it wouldn't matter whether the Communist Party did or did not advocate the overthrow, it wouldn't matter what the character of the Communist Party was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.627" offset="14217906">It would also have the objectionable feature of ignoring the element, the important element which this Court set out in Wieman against Updegraff of making irrelevant the particular individual's knowledge of the character of the Communist Party, which it seems to me would also be an important element in considering whether or not he was an undesirable alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.145" offset="14299930">But it still would be somewhat more rational than the present one which has in addition to that all of these other irrational elements of being a long time ago and it could have been of a brief period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.203" offset="14360221">Well, I think that -- that the statute is to be measured as to whether it's a reasonable statute to deport currently undesirable aliens, then under those standards, even that statute I think would have to fall because it would be defining it not in terms of culpable characteristics but it self is solely in terms of membership in an organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.980" offset="14443290">And particularly, one of the defects of this statute -- and of that statute too would be the assumption that the Communist Party can never change which itself I believe is an irrational assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.562" offset="14489579">I don't think I have time now to develop the remainder of my argument on the Bill of Attainder and ex post facto, and perhaps I can save a few minutes that might be remaining for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3630.196" offset="14624162">The first question for which this Court granted certiorari as whether the petitioner had been a member of the Communist Party as that term was defined by this Court in Galvan versus Press.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.061" offset="14687587">Or whether he had been only a nominal member and therefore not subject to deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.078" offset="14715695">And two, whether or not withstanding Galvan, the statute providing for deportation of aliens for past membership in the Communist Party is unconstitutional on its face or as applied to the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.901" offset="14779016">As I understand petitioner's position he accepts the -- the -- that part of the Galvan versus Press opinion which goes to the construction of Section 20 -- Section 22 of the Internal Security Act of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.359" offset="14856756">But for purposes of question too, he rejects the -- the constitutional holding in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.288" offset="14908479">I might just say very briefly that this case -- the petitioner was first ordered deported in 1936 on the ground that he was a member of an organization which advocated the overthrow of the Government by force and violence under the 1918 Act, that was the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.769" offset="14998444">And as we have already developed here, that -- at the time that he was arrested in -- within -- in those deportation proceedings at the end of 1935, he left the Communist Party.</text>
