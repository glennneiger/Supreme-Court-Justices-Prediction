            <label>Mr. William B. Bryant</label>
            <text syncTime="19.667" offset="183024">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.613" offset="214894">The case for the Court, Andrew Mallory versus United States, we believe presents three important questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.661" offset="263064">The first, whether or not the lower courts in the District of Columbia Circuit properly adhered to the pronouncements of this Court in McNabb versus United States and reiterated in Upshaw versus United States relative to alleged confessions of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.122" offset="348850">Number two, I believe that the important question is whether or not the consent allegedly given to the police by the petitioner herein for the search of his home for certain items of clothing while he was arrested and then the police headquarters measured up to that standard of voluntariness which the federal jurisdiction has adopted for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.596" offset="458773">And thirdly, whether or not the trial court's comment in answer to a question by the jury after deliberating some four or four and a half hours about the fate of the petitioner in the event that the jury did not impose a death penalty, was proper under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.736" offset="551351">Now, the factual picture which -- out of which these questions arises is briefly as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.884" offset="583952">On April 7th, 1954, a woman was allegedly raped in the 1200 Block of 12th Street Northwest in the District of Columbia in the basement of an apartment house in which she lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.750" offset="647377">The next day, at about 2:30, the petitioner was arrested in the Northeast section of Washington D.C. and taken to police headquarters at 13 Indiana Avenue, Northwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.977" offset="704324">Immediately upon his arrival at the police headquarters, he was interrogated in the so-called identification room at the police headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.005" offset="740373">The arrival was pitched at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.440" offset="766182">Here, the petitioner was questioned by at least seven or eight officers of the Sex Squad between 3 o'clock and shortly after 4:00 that he -- and then some times between 4:00 and 5:00 during that questioning, the petitioner denied any implication in the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.135" offset="848938">Some times between 4 and 5 o'clock, the police inquired of the petitioner and his two nephews, the children of his half brother who was a janitor of the apartment which the alleged crime occurred and who also in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.899" offset="911945">The police inquired as to whether or not they would take the lie detector test.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.127" offset="948935">Petitioner is alleged to have agreed to take a lie detector test along with the other two suspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.659" offset="975057">The man who was an expert at giving the examination was not immediately available and there was a waiting period of -- from about some time between 4 and 5 to about 7 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.510" offset="1034407">The officer eventually arrived, and after exposing the other two men who were in custody to the lie detector apparatus and the testing that goes on with it, the petitioner was called into the room some 120 feet away from the room in which he had been all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.394" offset="1117999">And there, in the lie detector room, which is a small room about the size enough to accommodate the machinery and the examiner and the -- and the subject, he was given the so-called “lie detector test.”</text>
            <text syncTime="269.261" offset="1181424">His questioning immediately before -- questioning during the -- during the examination at which time he was attached to the machinery by various wires and hoses and other attachments.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.961" offset="1232206">After the examination on the machine, he was subjected to still more questioning and some time between 9:30 and 9:45 p.m., according to the examining officer, he made certain oral admissions which implicated him in the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.516" offset="1298453">Thereupon, the examining officer called the two officers of the Sex Squad who were in charge of the case so to speak and indicated to those officers that the petitioner wanted to make a statement to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.495" offset="1346414">At that time, the oral admission originally made to the examiner, speaking of the lie detector machine technician, were allegedly repeated to officers (Inaudible) I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.052" offset="1400644">After the admissions were made, one officer to another said, “Try to get a hold of the Commissioner" having reference to the United States Commissioner and then for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.392" offset="1458009">A call was put through to the commissioner at his home and he was at that time unavailable, that was sometimes after 10 o'clock p.m., the first mention of the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.882" offset="1503880">Thereupon, the petitioner set out under police supervision a written statement embodying what's he had said to the officers are.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.083" offset="1556752">And immediately following the written statement, there was also a written consent to the officers to go to the premises and search certain areas and take from that area items or clothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.174" offset="1629059">The confessions are -- unwritten were introduced an evidence over objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.269" offset="1649434">The items of clothing which had been procured as the result of the so-called “consent to search” and which had been subjected to certain analysis by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and which should be -- reveal certain culminating characteristics were introduced to the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.629" offset="1718920">The jury was instructed, when he took the case, in the usual fashion except that when it got down to the point of the verdicts by virtue of the peculiar characteristic of the District of Columbia statute which allows the jury to add to the verdict of guilty if they so find the defendant who's charged with rape, guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.015" offset="1808468">He might add the words with the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.168" offset="1821111">Because of that, Judge Holtzoff read to them the following, and I -- I think that in these circumstances, I should read the charge because it is critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.042" offset="1880566">Beginning on page 5 -- page 105 of the record, if the Court please, the fourth paragraph beginning with “If you find the defendant guilty, you still have one more punishment”, the punishment provided by law for the crime of rape is either a death penalty or imprisonment for a term of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.969" offset="1972308">The decision, whether the death penalty should be inflicted, is made by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.595" offset="1990802">The jury has the right in the function of determining whether or not the death penalty should be inflicted on a rape case.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.863" offset="2015880">Consequently, if you find the defendant guilty as charged, you must then decide also whether the death penalty should be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.783" offset="2047540">If you unanimously reached the conclusion that the death penalty should be inflicted, then you may add to your verdict of guilty the words “with the death penalty”.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.655" offset="2087037">In such case, and such as your verdict, it will then be mandatory on the Court to impose the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.740" offset="2111384">The Court will have no discretion under that.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.369" offset="2121832">On the other hand, if you find the defendant guilty but you do not unanimously reach the conclusion that the death penalty should be inflicted, then your verdict should be simply guilty as charged without any addition to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.388" offset="2169898">In that event, the defendant will be subject to imprisonment which the Court will impose but will not be subject to the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.590" offset="2198737">Whether the death penalty, should or should not be imposed, in case you find the defendant guilty is entirely within your discretion and you have a right to consider any circumstances or weigh in his considerations in reaching the conclusion on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.656" offset="2250982">That is the critical part of the Court's charge in the light of the question we raised here.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.387" offset="2281911">If the Court please, after deliberating for something over four hours, we've indicated, the jury indicated that it wanted some explanation or some instructions from the Court and sent the Court a note which asks several questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.019" offset="2372504">The Court deals with this note on page 106 of the record, the Court called counsel to the bench and showed there's a note indicating that the jury had asked one, “Have we other choice of verdicts than this four?”</text>

            <text syncTime="611.457" offset="2550241">The subsequent questions, I believe, were outlined on page 106 of the record, have we other choice of verdicts than these four.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.715" offset="2583259">One, guilty with death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.920" offset="2592037">Two, guilty as charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.842" offset="2599769">Three, not guilty by reason of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.620" offset="2610845">Four, not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.546" offset="2618577">Now, the Court answered that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.380" offset="2637908">Now, those four are the only possible verdicts, no other verdict is possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.728" offset="2655357">Then the Court dealt with question number two.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.557" offset="2666642">Question number two was, on number two above having reference to guilty as charged, "Can we the jury be assured that the defendant legally be imprisoned for the remainder of his natural life?</text>
            <text syncTime="652.782" offset="2715544">No possibility of release - in his sentence."</text>
            <text syncTime="657.786" offset="2735501">The Court in response to that question said, "I can give you no such assurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.167" offset="2757026">I think I might explain to you that the maximum term the Court may impose is 30 years, but even if the Court imposes the maximum, and of course I can, even if the Court imposes the maximum, the Court also has to impose a minimum sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.655" offset="2815018">So that the longest term that the Court can impose would be an indeterminate sentence of 10 to 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.087" offset="2836752">The minimum has to be not more than a third of the maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.638" offset="2850962">Then at the end of the minimum sentence, the Parole Board would have to decide whether the maximum should be served, or anything less than the maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.327" offset="2881682">So that I can give you no assurance that the defendant would legally be imprisoned for the remainder of his natural life if he's found guilty as charged.</text>
