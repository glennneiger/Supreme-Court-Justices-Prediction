            <label>Mr. Sidney Kansas</label>
            <text syncTime="14.674" offset="162043">This case is much more simple than the preceding one.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.862" offset="182836">This case is in the field of immigration, naturalization and deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.936" offset="211153">Two questions are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.439" offset="221080">One, in an action brought in the U.S.District Court for declaratory judgment to declare the petitioner eligible for naturalization in order that he may apply for suspension of a deportation and where the District Director is made a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.302" offset="308537">Is the Attorney General an indispensable party?</text>
            <text syncTime="55.684" offset="326092">That's been a troublesome question for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.794" offset="342497">The District Court dismissed solely on the ground that the Attorney General was not made a party without going into the merits or the subsequent part of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.971" offset="391293">The court below -- the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed this Court in the Pedreiro case, decided about a year ago, that the Attorney General is not an indispensable party in this kind of actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.181" offset="464123">The District Director is a sufficient party.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.999" offset="483349">And the court below, mindful of a decision of this Court, preferred to follow its reasoning in the Vaz case, V-A-Z, decided by that Court in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.900" offset="538937">The reasoning there was that when an alien is ordered deported and he applies for a suspension of deportation, then he is seeking discretionary relief and therefore the Attorney General is an indispensable party.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.629" offset="613857">The case before this Court in Pedreiro, the alien was ordered deported, did not seek suspension of deportation but resisted deportation on constitutional ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.003" offset="679372">Now, the court below expressed doubt as to the correctness of its rule for it drew a very fine line of distinction between the Vaz case, that it decided and which does not reach this Court, and the Pedreiro case decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.229" offset="760247">And in its opinion on page 18 which stated, “Although the question is not free from doubt, we shall follow our reasoning of the Vaz case while the Supreme Court may decide that the distinction no longer holds, we do not think this is to be spelled out of Mr. Justice Black's opinion of Pedreiro case.”</text>

            <label>Mr. Sidney Kansas</label>
            <text syncTime="263.687" offset="1158144">Now, during the war years in 1942 to 1945, all male residents of the United States were required to register under the draft as it's well-known.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.516" offset="1217390">And if there were those who desire to be relieved or exempted from the draft, they'd file a Form 301 and it was then the Selective Service Board's duty to inform the alien that he has been relieved and exempted in accordance with the rules and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.175" offset="1320103">However, if this application that he filed was accepted and he was so informed then he forfeited his right for naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.783" offset="1358555">However, if the application was disregarded and he was placed in Class I-A, ordered to appear for preinduction and physical examination then he was not exempted and hence did not lose his right for naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.463" offset="1449253">Now, having passed point one, as I said, I will concentrate my -- on question number two.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.746" offset="1502333">Perhaps, at this point it's best to give a very brief statement of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.946" offset="1523127">The alien is a man about 42 years of age, born in the Republic of Columbia, South America.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.244" offset="1556355">He first entered the United States on a visa for permanent residence in February 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.787" offset="1586552">In May of that year, he registered for the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.466" offset="1605256">After waiting more than a year, not having heard anything from the draft, and in August of 1943, he appeared before the Board, filed his Form 301 requesting to be exempted and relieved from the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.510" offset="1677458">The Board did nothing until January of 1944, when they informed him that -- that they have disregarded his application and he has been placed in Class I-A, ordered to appear from preinduction and physical examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.042" offset="1747571">He appeared on the day set and the physical examination showed that he was suffering from some kidney ailment and he was reclassified and placed in Class IV-F.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.702" offset="1806190">Now, from the time of his first entry in 1942 until his last reentry in April of 1951, he had made several departures and reentries.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.133" offset="1867943">And during one of the last reentries in November 1950, he remained in New York City until January of 1951, married a citizen of the United States by birth and the next day departed for France for honeymoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.252" offset="1952371">In February, next month 1951, they decided to reenter the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.387" offset="1980897">The wife, travelling on an American passport, had no difficulty but the petitioner could not obtain a visa to reenter the United States on a visa for permanent residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.212" offset="2028231">The counsel having knowledge that he had filed a petition which barred him from citizenship could not get him a visa for permanent residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.621" offset="2069817">The best he could do was to give him a -- a transit visa which is good for 21 days stay in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.295" offset="2104508">He entered on this transit visa, and on the 23rd day after his entry he was served with a warrant of arrest and a deportation proceedings, taken to the Immigration Service, given a hearing why he should not be deported, having overstayed his time by a few days.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.332" offset="2180681">During the hearing, he applied for suspension of deportation, and the hearing officer said, "That must be denied because you are not eligible for naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.845" offset="2230732">You have filed a petition to be exempted and relieved in the war act."</text>
            <text syncTime="539.727" offset="2262288">Now, he appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, and that Board likewise held that the mere filing of the petition is sufficient to bargain from naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.493" offset="2313383">Then his only recourse was to the United States District Court, and in that Court, as I already stated, the Court dismissed solely on the ground that the Attorney General was not made a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.085" offset="2367718">Therefore, have no chance to state his case before that Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.271" offset="2392482">Now, I respectfully submit to the Court that the -- there was error on the part of the court below in holding that the mere filing of a petition is sufficient to bar from -- for naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.480" offset="2477328">Now, the Court -- bear with me for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.397" offset="2516929">The court below stated that Section 303 of Title 50 of the United States Code, I'm reading on page 19 of my brief, "Provides that an alien who has made application to be relieved from military service shall thereafter be debarred from becoming a citizen of United States."</text>
            <text syncTime="626.047" offset="2607522">And plaintiff made such an application and hence is not eligible for an order suspending deportation, but other Courts of Appeals don't agree with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.014" offset="2651408">The Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia takes an entirely different view of the subject, and other courts as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.402" offset="2684949">Now, the District Courts, they do -- one of the District Court, Eastern District of New York states, "Two conditions are requisites, the application for exemption and a record that he was relieved or discharged from training or service.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.766" offset="2750464">These requisites are not stated under disjunctive and if either fails the statutory ineligibility does not become automatic for one is of equal importance to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.339" offset="2796753">And then we have the District Court of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.601" offset="2813785">The courts held there, the intention of the Act plainly was to fixate penalty where an alien declarant was relieved from military service, page 10, bottom of page 10 of my petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.442" offset="2865089">And this case, the Government did not relieve the declarant from service.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.390" offset="2880972">Hence, no exemption right was accorded him and he should not be held to have incurred the penalty affixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.002" offset="2915349">And right here in Washington, same situation as we have in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.010" offset="2935411">An alien appeared and registered, waiting over a year, nothing happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.365" offset="2960802">He was not notified whether he was in or out, so he filed an application for naturalization in the District Court here, and the Court granted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.989" offset="3003329">The Government appealed, and the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia held, top of page 60 in my brief, "To debar the appellee from citizenship, the statute requires proof, not only that he applied for exemption on grounds of alienage, but also that he was relieved from serving for that reason."</text>
            <text syncTime="748.261" offset="3096430">The examiner's legal conclusion that appellee was relieved from military service because of alienage is not supported by any evidence in the present record.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.928" offset="3131120">We think the total absence of any such essential evidence is a sufficient basis for affirming the District Court's order granting naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.448" offset="3169155">Now, in the case at bar, the -- the record not only establishes that the petitioner was not relieved from military service because of alienage, but affirmatively shows that he was in fact classified I-A, and held liable to be called up for service.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.414" offset="3232998">Therefore, our case is much stronger than the one decided by the Court of Appeals of this -- the District of Columbia.</text>
