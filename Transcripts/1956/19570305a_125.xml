            <label>Mr. Ralph W. Currie</label>
            <text syncTime="24.550" offset="201540">Mr. Chief Justice and -- may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.700" offset="234141">Within the time which is allotted to me, I want to discuss the several legal questions that are presented by this appeal, including the question of mootness, and thereafter, assuming that a justiciable controversy exist my reasons for arguing that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.281" offset="352528">But before I begin the legal argument, I think it's appropriate and I believe I can be of the greatest assistance to the Court if I recite what the facts are, because it is difficult for me to explain my reasons for a legal conclusion without associating it with the facts upon which these conclusions are based.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.356" offset="484812">Now, the commodity that we're dealing with here is a commodity known as carbon black.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.771" offset="514487">Carbon black is a product of natural gas and oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.654" offset="534026">It is produced primarily in the State of Texas and -- in the Southwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.897" offset="559000">And the Panhandle area of Texas is the largest producer of carbon black.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.058" offset="587630">The principal users of carbon black are the rubber manufacturers or the tire manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.445" offset="621171">The -- there's a statement in the record to the effect that approximately 95% of all carbon black is used in the manufacture of rubber to its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.279" offset="680521">The Interstate Commerce Commission found in this particular proceeding and -- and the proceedings reported in 298 I.C.C. at 721.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.929" offset="719078">And on page 723 of that decision, the Interstate Commerce Commission in this case pointed out that between 40% and 60% of all of the carbon black that was used in rubber was consumed around the Akron, Ohio area.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.442" offset="801102">So that for all practical purposes what we have here was a movement, a tremendous movement of carbon black from the Panhandle area of Texas into Akron, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.929" offset="859094">The Commission's proceeding also discussed the fact that during the years 1954 and 1955, there seemed to be about 700,000 tons of this commodity that moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.176" offset="916041">It's quite a substantial movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.703" offset="926177">And the figures revealed to the Commission and recited by it in that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.352" offset="956792">It showed that 66 and ninth-tenth percent of it was moved by rail during those years and 28 -- eighth -- and eight-tenth percent by motor carrier with four and three-tenths percent by seatrain.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.091" offset="1011754">A seatrain is a water carrier that holds loaded railroad cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.536" offset="1029517">There was no movement by barge and by way of momentary digression, it is hard for me to restrain a chuckle when I hear counsel say as he did yesterday that the purpose in reducing these rate was to forestall barge competition because there immediately appears before my mind the picture of a barge moving from the area Panhandle of Texas across the plains there to Akron, Ohio which is also a place not on water.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.756" offset="1174444">The truth is that this movement of carbon black, it moved entirely by rail or by motor carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.549" offset="1209553">Those were the two competing forms of transportation that moved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.296" offset="1228570">Now, prior to 1954, and I will let you say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.117" offset="1255842">It constituted for the appellees and motor carriers whom I represent here a very important piece of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.779" offset="1294503">It was important out of proportion to the revenue we received for it because it supplied us with a return haul.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.504" offset="1333373">You see, under our certificates which the Commission issued to us, we are not allowed to handle products in bulk.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.414" offset="1369004">We are not allowed to handle livestock.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.624" offset="1385827">Now, in the Panhandle area of Texas, the things that are produced are grain, which moves in bulk and oil which moves in bulk or by pipeline and carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.148" offset="1435982">Consequently, when we carry products of general merchandise into the West Texas Panhandle area, there is little that we are authorized to move back.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.547" offset="1489586">And carbon black which moves in sacks is a commodity which offered us a return haul into the Akron, Ohio area.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.765" offset="1530441">So, it was of a -- a great deal of importance and at the time this controversy arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.623" offset="1557817">We were -- excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.865" offset="1570879">We were getting revenues in excess of a $1000 a day out of this transportation of the small percentage of the carbon black that we were being privileged to handle.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.172" offset="1628035">Prior to 1954, the rail rates and the motor carrier rates were on the same level or substantially the same level.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.654" offset="1665964">It had been that way for some time.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.104" offset="1675786">Now, during the period following World War II, there had been blanket general increases granted to the railroads and taken by the motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.247" offset="1724374">And as a result of this -- of the application of these blanket general increases, the rates got slightly out of adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.180" offset="1752064">The typical illustration which everybody agrees was typical, was the rate from the Panhandle points of Texas such as Borger and Amarillo into Akron, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.529" offset="1813504">There, the -- the rate when you add it on the various increases and calculated them according to the different formulas, the rails had a rate of $1.56 a hundred and the motor carriers a rate of $1.53 a hundred.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.631" offset="1881945">The railroads in -- early in 1954 filed a new schedule and reduced their rate not to meet the motor carrier rate but down to $1.4785, one hundredths cents per hundred, which put them five and fifteen one hundred cents per hundred pounds below the then prevailing motor carrier rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.741" offset="1998346">The motor carriers then filed with the Commission a new tariff seeking to establish the same $1.4785 per hundred pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.179" offset="2044113">The rails protested that and the Commission suspended the rates of the motor carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.404" offset="2077027">That was in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.122" offset="2087894">Hearing was had on the suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.167" offset="2096044">They entered onto an investigation and the hearing was had in July 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.768" offset="2118405">The seven months period expired with no action on the part of the Commission and the motor carriers voluntarily extended the period of suspension and this was the customary practice we are told until the Commission could complete its investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.961" offset="2199176">At the time of the controversy which had its inception in September 1925 -- of 1955, the Commission had not yet completed its investigation and had not handed down its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.736" offset="2266363">Neither had it done so at the time of the trial in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.214" offset="2288201">So that the practical effect of that situation was that the railroads were enjoying a differential of five and fifteen-one hundred cents below our rate, notwithstanding that differential in their favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.231" offset="2356328">They proceeded by carriers which were scheduled to become effective on September the 24th, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.548" offset="2397602">Rates which cut the particular rate down from a dollar forty-seven eighty-five down to a dollar thirty-three, precisely twenty cents, a hundred pounds under our rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.569" offset="2453608">We knew then that we could not exist with a twenty-cent differential against this.Even the 28% of the traffic we were getting would be gone with 700,000 tons moving that.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.822" offset="2518706">20 cents a hundred is -- is quite a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.575" offset="2533648">So, we petitioned the Interstate Commerce Commission to suspend those rates on the ground as we thought that they were -- the rail carriers were embarking upon a course of a destructive competitive practice that was in contravention on the National Transportation Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.069" offset="2635630">The -- the Commission suspended our rates, I mean the rail rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.720" offset="2658304">Our petition was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.973" offset="2671261">By its order of September the 23rd, 1955 the Interstate Commerce Commission, not the Board of Suspension, but the Commission, the Division 2 itself, acting as an appellate division entered this order which was admitted by everybody to be a valid order and well within the powers of the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="2018.207" offset="8176201">You may be able to change your opinion, but here in this case, the Commission was under a statutory duty and under Section 15, subsection 7 of the Interstate Commerce Act to state reasons why it would interfere with the -- with the, otherwise, invaluable right of the carrier to initiate its own rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.285" offset="8272541">It made this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.026" offset="8279437">It -- it stated those reasons and those reasons were in substance that other people were going to be hurt by this publication or that there was probable cause to believe that there would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.730" offset="8338265">As a matter of fact, I think we can agree that the only time the Commission in the exercise of sound discretion can interfere with the carrier's right to publish its own rates is because it has determined that somebody is going to get hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.647" offset="8405974">Otherwise, there's no reason to interfere with what the carrier may do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.054" offset="8423633">And once the Commission has found that there exist a situation, which causes -- which may injure someone and has decided to take action to protect that someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.719" offset="8490297">Then, if the Commission decides that it is wrong about that that those facts do not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.922" offset="8527078">I think it owes to that person the same duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.781" offset="8542542">Having once found that those rights are to be protected, the Commission is under a mandatory duty to protect them and if it finds it's in error about that, it owes to the -- to the person whose rights are thus being not longer protected, the duty to say -- to give the reasons for it just as though to the same standards it had to tell the carrier in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.185" offset="8640136">I think that's just with simple fairness and a necessary corollary to the suspension power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.787" offset="8666572">Those things, the Commission did not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.338" offset="8676707">As a matter of fact, it seemed to have regarded it, just as though -- just as the District Court did in the Western supply, the Western Electric Company against Cinema Supplies Company, a case by the Sixth Circuit, in which the Court seemed to have found on a temporary injunction, mind you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.582" offset="8757687">It found all of the facts in favor of the plaintiffs that would entitle the plaintiffs to the injunctive relief sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.990" offset="8795303">And then said that we have balanced the equities and they decided that we will not issue the injunction because under the -- all of the balancing of equities, it would not be right to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.677" offset="8838040">And the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth -- for the Sixth Circuit reversed and said that when a court has made -- when a case for temporary injunction is clearly made out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.872" offset="8878895">It does not lie within the power of a court, though it'd be discretionary to deny the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.986" offset="8907316">And certainly whereas here, the facts which the Commission found to exist and which it did not take away in its subsequent order as it left those facts still enforced by its subsequent order -- by the very nature of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.632" offset="9001880">It's simply saying that were just not going to grant the remedy any longer.</text>
