            <text syncTime="1532.123" offset="6232879">Wherever a line is drawn at any point in this area, there will be three kinds of material that will fall below the line.</text>

            <text syncTime="1558.130" offset="6336951">There will be some more people who are catering to the interests that are barred by the statute, catering to the erotic, catering to those interests which the statute is designed to protect from interference and who are skating as close to the line as they can.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.997" offset="6400376">This is what we define the petitioner here, Roth is in the borderline area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.907" offset="6423991">He is trying to produce material, has been producing material which if confronted, he would not concede as obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.680" offset="6463070">He would hope that a jury of 12 would not unanimously agree beyond a reasonable doubt if it fell within that class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.918" offset="6496089">The third category are those who don't care about the line or rather they know about the line and are deliberately trying to produce material which they know to be illegal, comparable to bootleg whiskey, there's no question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.029" offset="6552513">They're not trying to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.516" offset="6558469">They're trying to produce the material that's prohibited by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.620" offset="6574874">Now, we -- in running through the convictions which figures were available here in the Post Office Department of the published material, pressed, reproduced photo, commercially reproduced material which is involved in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.802" offset="6635583">About 90% of that kind of -- of published material falls into the black market, hardcore pornography sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.647" offset="6667034">Now, that is not a reliable statistic which anyone -- you need to put much -- put much weight on.</text>

            <text syncTime="1648.525" offset="6698486">Whether it's 90% now, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.939" offset="6708203">If the statute is declared unconstitutional, I believe it will play the volume of material going through the mails to be substantially larger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.004" offset="6748432">This commercial material is unpleasant to talk about, unpleasant to think about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.503" offset="6770375">The-- the briefs, amicus curia filed in this Court indicate that people prefer to talk about civil liberties, the borderline between a great novel and a what might be considered obscene, the issues where censorship may trespass on vital scientific works of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.292" offset="6853548">Those are much more interesting issues than the ones we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.181" offset="6877163">This matter is concededly obscene if anything is obscene and the statute question is, "Can Congress bar that stuff from the mail?"</text>

            <text syncTime="1708.517" offset="6938499">A large part is photographs, photographs of all sorts of person, people, generally without any clothes on in all cultures, groups, individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.848" offset="6983743">They're engaged in activity, perversion of every kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.237" offset="7009343">These, if you read the briefs indicate that this is a vital freedom of -- these are the ideas which must be communicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.649" offset="7042988">The idea of content within the First Amendment terms of any such material is negative.Second category of materials, a little booklet of series of sex episodes, one after the other usually illustrated these photographs or drawings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.363" offset="7113832">Third category, are comic books, especially drawn for the pornographic trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.809" offset="7139641">Fourth category is motion picture films.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.869" offset="7151867">We did not make any of those available to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.097" offset="7160748">If they should want to see them, it could be arranged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.659" offset="7170988">They are the worst, most vile, any form of pornography in my estimation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.374" offset="7201917">This material has no idea of content.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.362" offset="7213829">If there is any idea, it can easily be said by other means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.899" offset="7235981">The Kingsley Books and other books illustrate that you can discuss this -- this subject to sexual morality and conduct without being obscene.</text>

            <text syncTime="3197.832" offset="12895775">The Government is talking about material in another case than this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.682" offset="12923152">I'd also like to spend the moment on the scope of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.959" offset="12944259">The review was very specifically set out here in three questions, relating to the constitutionality of this statute on its face and as applied under the First, the Fifth, the Ninth and Tenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.911" offset="13007997">Now, the Government in its brief at Page 56 suggests, under the limited grant of certiorari, it is to be taken as given that the material to which the statute was construed to apply is likely to corrupt the morals of the average members of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.300" offset="13073617">So, we challenge this statement, because if getting to -- getting past the point, I first say that when the First Amendment says, ‚ÄúCongress shall pass no law,‚Äù that's just what it meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.515" offset="13126489">But, when we get beyond that, if we get to the clear and present danger test, we are in such questions as what is the substantive evil and did these publications have a probability of causing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.481" offset="13178316">That is also involved within the scope of review here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.516" offset="13194512">Now, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I'd like to begin with your question as to whether the Post Office has to carry the material.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.024" offset="13224500">And here I began with -- begin with the statement by Mr. Justice Holmes in a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Brandeis concurred in the Burleson case, a dissenting opinion which was approved by this Court in Hannegan against Esquire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.493" offset="13290329">Mr. Justice Holmes said, ‚ÄúThe United States may give up the Post Office when it sees fit, but while it carries it on the use of the mails is almost as much a part of free speech as the right to use our tongues.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.823" offset="13343723">And if we're going to have a Post Office Department, it has to carry the material.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.089" offset="13364726">And if I have to refer to an analogy where you had a comparable situation in the corner of the century before the civil war broke up, there was on the statute books, an Act of 1836, which specifically made it a penal offense, if any Postmaster should unlawfully detain in his office any letter, package, pamphlet or newspaper with intent to prevent the arrival and delivery of the same to the person or persons to whom such letter, package, pamphlet or newspaper maybe addressed or directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.580" offset="13590737">That's an Act which Congress passed after it had refused to enact a measure for which President Jackson called in December 1835, for barring the use of the mails incendiary publications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.953" offset="13648206">And pursuant to that statute, you had rulings both by the Attorney General and also by the Postmaster General that state laws obtain supremacy when it came to a question of incendiary publications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.511" offset="13702437">In 1857, the United States Attorney General Cushing ruled that a Mississippi statute, forbidding delivery of incendiary matter was not in conflict with the federal law of 1836 and no Postmaster was required to deliver material, the design and pendency of which you're to promote insurrection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.050" offset="13772549">Now, I would say to Your Honor, that the Postmaster General has to carry the material because the First Amendment said, ‚ÄúCongress shall make no law.‚Äù</text>
