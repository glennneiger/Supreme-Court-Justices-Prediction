            <label>Mr. Richard E. Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="27.831" offset="214706">This matter is before this Court on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit which Court affirmed the decision of the United States Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.590" offset="273742">The facts in this matter are relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.156" offset="287953">The taxpayer petitioner, Max Putnam together with two other individual persons caused to be formulated a corporation known as Whitehouse Publishing Company for the purpose of engaging in the printing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.736" offset="354304">Each of those three individuals, including the petitioner, acquired one-third of the capital stock of Whitehouse Publishing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.830" offset="398712">Shortly after the incorporation and after the acquisition by the corporation of the necessary fixed assets for its operations, it became necessary for it to have the short-term use of some additional operating funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.858" offset="478856">Those funds were procured by borrowing from a bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.850" offset="498813">And the petitioner Putnam personally guaranteed the borrowings of the corporation from the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.081" offset="543744">The corporate operation proved unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.642" offset="561925">Its assets were fully liquidated, applied to the corporate obligations and after all of its assets had been so consumed, there remained an outstanding liability of the corporation to the bank with reference to which the petitioner had executed his guaranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.753" offset="646353">There is no question here with reference to the actuality and reality of the petitioner's loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.616" offset="677804">The only issue is this, is the loss suffered by the petitioner, a loss resulting from a transaction entered into for profit and consequently deductible in full under Section 23 (e) (2) of the 1939 Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.384" offset="764949">Or was this loss so suffered by the petitioner, a loss resulting from the worthlessness or the fact of becoming worthless of a nonbusiness bad debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.309" offset="824613">Now, in the lower courts, the issue has narrowed down to just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.908" offset="851048">It is also recognized by the parties here that these Sections are mutually exclusive, that even though, and I believe it is conceited by the respondent that it is a fact that the loss did result from a transaction entered into for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.093" offset="911757">But even though the loss so resulted, it is not deductible under 23 (e) (2) if it is deductible under 23 (k) (4), which is the code Section relating to the deductibility of nonbusiness bad debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.873" offset="986885">The tax -- the taxpayer's argument as set forth in its written brief is also relatively simple.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard E. Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="236.259" offset="1048430">If it is a loss within the purview of 23 (k) (4), then it is deduct -- deductible only as a short-term capital loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.479" offset="1081240">Whereas, if the loss does not fall within the purview of that Section, then it does fall within the purview of 23 (e) (2) and is deductible in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.847" offset="1122722">The taxpayer's argument has set forth in its written brief is also relevantly simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.713" offset="1150203">And it is predicated on a series of decisions, which are cited in petitioners brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.409" offset="1184998">The cases there principally are the Pollak case, and the Cudlip case, and the Allen versus Edwards case, and the Ansley case, in which cases -- and the Fox case, in which cases the so-called no debt theory was established and some several times followed by various Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.963" offset="1267231">The no debt theory in turn is founded upon a decision of this Court in Eckert versus Burnet, 283 U.S. 140, a case decided in 1931.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.787" offset="1318536">Now it's true as the respondent points out in his brief that Eckert versus Burnet involved a different statute than the one with which we're concerned here.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.901" offset="1355003">The statute then did not distinguish between business and nonbusiness bad debts, but it did provide that a loss, as a consequence of a bad debt, could be deducted provided it was ascertained to be worthless, and provided that it was charged of during the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.937" offset="1451133">That case also involved a loss resulting from a guaranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.982" offset="1483316">The only thing in that case that is of consequence to us here and I think it is of major consequence because that case is so heavily relied upon by the various Circuit Courts in the adoption of the so-called no debt theory is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.702" offset="1546219">The Court in Eckert versus Burnet in effect said that a debt, worthless when acquired, cannot be considered to be a debt at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.611" offset="1585821">In other words, the Court there is saying that a debt or the term debt as used in federal taxation presupposes something of value in the hands of the party who proposes to charge the debt off or to treat the worthlessness of the debt as the occasion for a deduction from taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.541" offset="1677563">The no debt theory actually amounts to simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.314" offset="1700655">The execution by the petitioner taxpayer of the guaranty itself created no debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.731" offset="1738271">The performance by the petitioner of his guaranty, of the corporation's obligation to the bank, could have freed to the debt only if there were at that time some reasonable hope and expectation on his part of recovery from the principle debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.911" offset="1814967">Which in this instance and in the factual situations embraced in the Cudlip, and Pollak, and Allen cases, which there was no reasonable expectation of recovery because the corporations in those cases and in this one, which were the principle debtors were without assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.007" offset="1895424">They have no means with which to pay with the consequence that there was no debt because there was no hope or expectation of recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.448" offset="1945161">Also, 23 (k) (4), which the respondent wishes to apply here requires not only that there be a debt but that the debt become worthless within the taxable year and these decisions upon which we have relied call attention to the necessity under 23 (k) (4) for the active event of worthlessness to occur during the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.720" offset="2058219">And of course, that is an impossibility where there is -- where the so-called debt is worthless at that time that it comes into the hands of the taxpayer, as a result of the performance of his guaranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.979" offset="2123316">Now, the respondent's argument here and I want devote particular attention to that because we have not filed a reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.078" offset="2155708">Our facilities in Iowa for quickly preparing and having printed briefs are -- were not adequate to enable us to prepare and file a reply brief here.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.956" offset="2207222">And for that reason, I do want to devote particular attention to respondent's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.447" offset="2233135">I want to point out that the respondent's argument throughout is predicated upon two basic and continuing errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.108" offset="2267826">The respondent's argument is principally that expressed by Judge Stewart in the Cudlip case in a dissenting opinion which he filed there.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.399" offset="2316936">The errors that continue throughout the respondent's argument are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.930" offset="2343058">The respondent feels to distinguish between the substantive position and the substantive rights of an investor whether he be a lender or a stockholder, and the substantive position and rights of a guarantor who has performed his guaranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.212" offset="2420172">The respondent fails to recognize that the act of lending money or the act of purchasing stock create thereupon an asset in the hands of the investor or loaner-lender, whereas, the execution of a guaranty does not create or bring to the hands of the guarantor any assets whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.029" offset="2539499">As a matter of fact, all it creates for him is a contingent liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.125" offset="2559875">He does not have an asset that he can sell or exchange as is the case of the lender or of the investor in corporate stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.457" offset="2601148">There is no value in his hands by reason of his execution of the guaranty, whereas, there is value in the hands if the lender or of the stock investor.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.370" offset="2640854">There are no earnings resulting directly to the guarantor by virtue of the execution of his guaranty but there are earnings normally inuring for the benefit of the party making a loan or the party acquiring stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.013" offset="2707414">With a result that the respondent has failed throughout to recognize that basic difference in substantive position of the investor and of the guarantor.</text>

            <text syncTime="669.298" offset="2780557">That is true and it is on that basis that the execution of a guaranty and the lost that results therefrom are treated as being losses resulting from a transaction entered into for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.140" offset="2835937">But there is nothing in the hands of the guarantor as a result of the execution of his guaranty that constitutes an asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.209" offset="2860178">There is nothing that he can sell.</text>

            <text syncTime="821.474" offset="3389315">“So long as payment of a debt is guaranteed by a solvent guarantor, the insolvency of the principal debtor obviously does not render the debt worthless.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.154" offset="3427976">Consequently, if the debt which a guarantor acquires by subrogation becomes worthless, it necessarily becomes worthless in the hands of the guarantor rather than in the hands of the original creditor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="842.401" offset="3473011">Now, I -- I feel that that is rather strained reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.803" offset="3494536">It's an effort on the effort on the part of the respondent to satisfy the requirement of the statute that the debt or obligation must have become worthless in the hands of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.713" offset="3538213">The statute is not referring to the occurrence of worthlessness in any other person's hands but only in the hands of the taxpayer, and that respondent is in effect the same when -- if the guarantor himself is solvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.383" offset="3596936">He in effect can owe himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="922.035" offset="3791496">These cases that involved the so-called no debt theory only concern guaranties of corporate obligations, where the corporation is without assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.490" offset="3841337">That is the only place in which this so-called no debt theory arises and has been applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.907" offset="3871013">Now, Congress itself has very definitely recognized the difference in the substantive position of the lender or stock investor as compared with the guarantor.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.603" offset="3929736">Prior to the -- prior to 1942, both business and nonbusiness bad debts were fully deductible from taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.377" offset="3972890">No distinction was made between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.603" offset="3985742">Congress was aware of the fact that many taxpayers being in a -- in a situation similar to that of the person who had loaned money were being restricted to capital loss limitations with reference to losses that they might suffer, that was through of the individual who owns stock in a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.453" offset="4065155">It was through the individual who owns securities as defined in the Internal Revenue law.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.374" offset="4092844">If they had a loss, they were subjected to the limitations of the capital loss provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.163" offset="4112071">But the ordinary lender, the nonbusiness lender was not prior to 1942, subjected to those limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.388" offset="4140910">In Congress, in amending the law in 1942 and establishing the distinction between business and nonbusiness bad debts was recognized that the nonbusiness lender was actually in the same position and category as he who held a security that did qualify as such under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.944" offset="4219173">And was recognizing that the so-called lender then should be subjected to the same limitations with reference to deductions upon loss, as the owner of a security becoming worthless would be subjected too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.021" offset="4283434">Furthermore, proceeding from 1942 up to 1954, Congress in 1954 through the adoption of the -- of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, inserted a provision, 166 (f), which provides as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.365" offset="4364831">A payment by the taxpayer, other than a corporation in discharge of part or all of his obligation as a guarantor, endorser, or indemnitor of a noncorporate obligation, the proceeds of which were used in the trade or business of the borrower shall be treated as a debt becoming worthless within such taxable year for the purposes of this Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.531" offset="4453543">But only if the obligation of the borrower to the person to whom such payment was made was worthless, without regard to such guaranty, endorsement, or indemnity at the time of such payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.014" offset="4495444">Now, note that Congress did not, by that enactment change the situation with reference to the ordinary lender.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.595" offset="4537762">Now, certainly the loss that the lender suffers is just as real as the loss suffered by the guarantor, or endorser, or indemnitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.193" offset="4572139">But Congress recognized through this enactment and through its failure to give the lender the same benefits that were being extended to the guarantor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.895" offset="4614980">Under this enactment, Congress was recognizing the difference in the substantive position and rights of the guarantor as compared with he who actually loaned his money or with he who invested his money in the form of stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.772" offset="4682480">Now, it's also true and I suppose it should be commented upon at this time, that Section 166 (f) relates only to guarantors of noncorporate obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.423" offset="4737024">That poses the question as to why Congress selected only the non -- the guarantor of the noncorporate obligation to extend this additional benefit to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.344" offset="4780701">The Section 166 (f) actually arose in the Senate and the Senate Report Number 1622, 83d Cong., 2d Sess.200, stated that where the requirements of subsection (f) are not met, the taxpayer will as under present law be treated tax wise under whatever provisions of the code are applicable in the factual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.638" offset="4921971">In other words, Congress again had no reason to discriminate in favor of the guarantor of a noncorporate obligation and against the guarantor of the corporate obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.733" offset="4962304">But Congress recognized that the law as it already existed, as it was in 1942 and was from that time up until 1954, did give the guarantor of a corporate obligation, the same benefit which they now were extending by statute to the guarantor of the noncorporate obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.891" offset="5050911">I assume they felt that was necessary for this reason, if a corporation were without assets and was technically indebted to a taxpayer there would be no question as to the permanent worthlessness of the obligation, which the taxpayer had acquired by subrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.742" offset="5126353">Whereas, on the other hand, if the obligation were owing from a noncorporate debtor to the guarantor, there always remains the possibility of future recoupment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.230" offset="5184240">So Congress did two things by the enactment of 166 (f) and it's very clear that this is what was in their minds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.664" offset="5222066">They again recognized the substantive difference between the position of the lender or stockholder as compared with that of the guarantor and they specifically recognized and gave their congressional blessing to the so-called no debt theory that was adopted by the Circuit Courts of Appeals in the Pollak, Edwards, and Ansley cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.515" offset="5325406">Now, the other basic fault in the reason of the respondent in his brief is this and that is that the respondent fails to recognize the presupposition contained in 23 (k) (4), that there must have been something -- there must have been an obligation having value in the hands of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.991" offset="5435329">Not in the hands of the principal creditor because we're not dealing with his tax problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.457" offset="5457168">We're dealing with the problem of the guarantor taxpayer and how can 23 (k) (4) have any application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.579" offset="5501680">How can there be an obligation to become worthless unless there was at sometime in the hands of the taxpayer something of value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.090" offset="5547760">With the consequence that the rule of Eckert versus Burnet, which first established for the purpose of federal tax law, a debt which was valueless at the time of the acquisition could not be deemed to become worthless in the hands of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.272" offset="5616410">But not be deemed to be the basis of a charge off under that statute in the hands of the taxpayer remains good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.172" offset="5648071">It has been followed by the various Circuit Courts of Appeals and has been recognized by Congress as already having extended to the guarantors of noncorporate obligation, I mean a corporate obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.838" offset="5710764">The same treatment with reference to losses as a consequence thereof, that Congress extends to Section 166 (f) of the 1955 Internal Revenue Code to those who lose as a consequence of their personal guaranties of noncorporate obligations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1636.339" offset="6648769">The Tax Court and the Court of Appeals have held that he is entitled to a deduction for a bad debt under Section 23 (k).</text>

            <text syncTime="1660.822" offset="6746676">Now, it's necessary for the taxpayer to make that contention because as he pointed out, 23 (k), the bad debt provision and 23 (e), are mutually exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.924" offset="6799026">Congress has carved out of the general category of losses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1774.989" offset="7203297">And he argues on that branch of the case that this guaranty was part of a transaction entered into for profit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1817.254" offset="7372361">So that on that phase of the case it's a transaction entered into for profit but not incurred in his trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.095" offset="7411754">Now, he -- he therefore, if successful on that argument, would be entitled to an ordinary loss under 23 (e) (2), which would be fully deductible against the ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.498" offset="7481344">Now, I think it might be fair to point out that if he's right in this contention, that he is not entitled to a bad debt deduction because the -- as he calls of the no debt theory, that the debt was worthless when he acquired it through payment of the guaranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.408" offset="7572982">That while it may be down to his benefit in this case, that in the ordinary situation of a person alone, not entered into for profit, where the taxpayer is a guarantor on a loan made by a friend or associate, and he is compelled to make good on the loan because the principle is in default.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.933" offset="7691055">Now, in that situation, the logic of the taxpayer's argument here would compel to conclusion that the ordinary taxpayer in that situation would have no deduction at all, because under the taxpayers theory here he wouldn't have a bad debt deduction since there was no debt, and you couldn't come under 23 (e) (2) because there was no profit motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.730" offset="7798262">Now, coming to the merits of the -- the so-called no debt theory, which as Mr. Williams pointed out, has been accepted in three very recent decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.560" offset="7845595">Now, the first one was in the Third Circuit in 19 -- January of 1954 and the two other cases, the Cudlip case in the Sixth Circuit, from which Judge Stewart dissented, and the case in the Fifth Circuit, the Edwards and Allen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.150" offset="7919992">Prior to 1954 it had been consistently held by the Tax Court, by the Commissioner, by several Courts of Appeals, the First Circuit in Hamlen and Welch in 116 F.2d, and the Second Circuit in the Shiman case in 60 F.2d, that a guarantor's loss was to be treated as bad debt loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.805" offset="8018631">The logic, the rationale of those decisions was quite simple, that the loss arose from a -- from a debt and therefore the deduction also was to be treated as arising from the debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.493" offset="8077354">Because the -- a surety or a guarantor, when he -- when he pays the creditor does not there -- thereby extinguish the debt by operation of the familiar principles of subrogation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2124.658" offset="8601997">Now, if -- if every bad if -- if a bad debt were automatically a no debt, the consequence would be to -- really to mutilate the concept of a -- of a bad debt and I can illustrate that was a simple example.</text>

            <text syncTime="2577.292" offset="10412492">Well, the -- the argument that there was no debt at all is based on -- on cases which hold that a debt doesn't arise, where there's -- where the creditor has no expectation of -- of repayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.598" offset="10477798">He does -- his motives are other than those and to take the -- the illustration, I put a little while ago, A lending money to B and B is hopelessly insolvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.897" offset="10518967">Now, suppose we add to that one further element, that A, when he lends that money to B, knows that B is hopelessly insolvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.209" offset="10560240">And when he -- when he makes that loan, he doesn't have any hope or expectation of repayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.141" offset="10583960">Now, in those -- in that situation, and there are cases that involved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.056" offset="10603604">The courts have held incorrectly that what appears to be a loan on the surface isn't really a loan at all, because the creditor is in effect making a gratuity, a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.309" offset="10652609">So that there are -- there are cases which -- which -- in which language appears, which in the context of those opinions is perfectly correct and -- and unchallengeable that where there's no appropriate expectation of -- of payment of the debt, it's not a debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.927" offset="10731081">Now, to take that language, which is meaningful in the context of a voluntary loan to someone who is insolvent and to translate it vitally to a situation like this, where the debt arises involuntarily by operation of law, there is no suggestion in this case that the taxpayer was making a gift to the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.200" offset="10848214">If he were making a gift to the corporation, he wouldn't be entitled to any deduction and to -- and we think that if it's an uncritical application of the -- of the language in cases involving what is in substance a gratuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.510" offset="10917386">Now, in this case we have what in substance is a capital investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.120" offset="10947897">In this case the corporation was setup in 1946 by the taxpayer and two others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.073" offset="10971617">He furnished all of the working capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.094" offset="10983737">He contributed a building.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.399" offset="10988962">He contributed a lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.073" offset="10995649">He made a direct loan from his own pocket and the with respect to the printing presses, they went to the bank and executed these two notes which he signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.448" offset="11041207">The collateral for the -- one of the notes with his personal life insurance and automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.191" offset="11060120">And as the Tax Court said, the loan wouldn't have been made if -- if a taxpayer individually hadn't furnished this credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.114" offset="11115813">He was supplying risk capital in the form of his credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.999" offset="11131382">Now, the whole theory of our -- the whole pattern of the tax law is that when one makes a capital contribution, whether it takes the form of an investment by buying stock or the form of a loan to the corporation, whether or not it's evidenced by security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.505" offset="11209435">If it's a capital transaction and the investment is a good one, the taxpayer pays tax on capital gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.753" offset="11254366">And if the corporation fails, he is entitled to deductions on a capital loss basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.720" offset="11282265">As Judge Stewart very succinctly pointed out in his dissenting opinion in the Cudlip case, if -- if the taxpayer here had borrowed the money from the bank himself, on his own credit and had turned around and lent the money to the corporation, he would have -- he would have suffered a loss but would've been treated as a capital loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.040" offset="11383515">If he had invested in the corporation by subscribing this additional stock so the corporation could take that money and buy these printing presses, that -- that too would have been deductible as a capital loss, no matter how he risked his capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.033" offset="11451538">It would have been -- it would have given rise to a deduction as a capital loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.153" offset="11472018">Now, if the -- if these three Circuit -- Circuits are right, if a guarantor if -- if the capital -- if capital is risked in the form of a guaranty of a bank loan, the result would be that in that single type of investment the investor, if the -- if the enterprise succeeds, pays taxes on his -- on his profits as capital gains but if the corporation fails he gets an ordinary loss deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.813" offset="11622588">Now, we're not arguing -- we're not presenting that as an argument on the merits but I think it bears on the reasoning of those -- on the reasoning of those opinions, which to some extent suggest that it's unrealistic to treat a debt which is worthless when acquired as a debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.723" offset="11698239">I think this case is an illustration of the proposition that what in a -- in a particular case may seem to be inequitable for a particular taxpayer and produces the decision in his favor may result in a rule which is a applied to other taxpayers is inequitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.556" offset="11793638">Mr. Putnam is -- as out of pocket this $9000 and he certainly should be given a deduction for it but to -- to say that he is entitled to a deduction for -- as an ordinarily loss, what it seems to us introducing to the statute something that isn't fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.998" offset="11887365">It will -- will result in incongruities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.449" offset="11897187">The Government's argument here in a sense is a technical one because we do rely upon the doctrine of subrogation, which might be thought of as a legal fiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.865" offset="11950791">But it isn't -- it isn't a fiction at all in the sense that the loss here arises from what originally was a debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.245" offset="11992377">Mr. Putnam's loss arose from the fact that he was a surety on his debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.506" offset="12013380">It was the debt which gives rise to his loss and it seems that the debt should give rise to his deduction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3234.825" offset="13042709">In that case a statement which was subsequently explained by Judge Learned Hand in the Shiman case in 60 F.2d.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.256" offset="13072384">In short, in the Eckert case, the taxpayer was on a cash basis when he -- in the tax year concerned, he had not paid cash to the creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.609" offset="13117837">What he had done was substitute the corporation's notes in which he was secondarily liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.232" offset="13148348">He had substitute for those notes his own personal notes and he sought to take a deduction in that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.379" offset="13176874">And the -- this Court held that the cash basis taxpayer has to pay out cash and when it -- there's an intimation in the opinion of Mr. Justice Holmes that when he does pay out cash, he is entitled for deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.672" offset="13230059">Now, that provision -- that situation arose in the Shiman case in 60 F.2d that Judge Learned Hand dealt with.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard E. Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="3292.361" offset="13272795">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.802" offset="13282617">I'd like to try to clarify this matter of 23 (e) (2) and 23 (k) (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.697" offset="13306128">As I understand it, the respondent does not contend that this loss did not result from a transaction entered into for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.876" offset="13334862">I think the respondent concedes that but the respondent says, that since the transaction was a bad debt transaction, then it must be deducted under that Section and be subjected to its limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.348" offset="13384808">Whereas the petitioner here has said, it was a loss from a transaction entered into for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.292" offset="13408528">It did not result from a bad debt, consequently, the deduction shall be taken under 23 (e) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.348" offset="13436740">And I don't think any now we probably should have pointed out that there is a 23 (e) (1), which relates to losses resulting from the operation of a trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.264" offset="13476446">Now, this loss, we concede is not a loss resulting from the operation of a trade or business, but it comes within that second category of losses resulting from transactions entered into for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.541" offset="13525556">I had intended initially and neglected to point out one thing pertaining to the facts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.788" offset="13550529">At the time that petitioner Putnam executed the first of two guaranties that were involved, he owned only one-third of the stock of this corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.558" offset="13585638">At the time that he executed the second, he owned two-thirds of the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.591" offset="13601729">Now, the truth of the matter is that if petitioner Putnam had been actually the controlling stockholder of this corporation, the time these guaranties were executed, I have no doubt but the Commissioner would have taken the position from the very beginning that the guaranty actually constituted a contribution to capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.022" offset="13683440">Now, being unable to do that because he cannot demonstrate that the petitioner control the corporation, he does the next best thing from his point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.835" offset="13714683">And that is to attempt to convert what is not a debt transaction into one that is through the strained reason by which he gives this debt some value in the hands of petitioner Putnam through the theory of subrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.207" offset="13788244">He calls attention some several times to Judge Stewart's dissent in the Cudlip case and it's true Judge Stewart was fearful that the decision of the majority would open the door to the substitution of guaranties for actually investment capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.521" offset="13865462">But let me point out that the Commissioner has a tool with which to combat that and he has very successfully used it in many occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.324" offset="13892629">And that is to look at the substance of the transaction and if it does involve a contribution to capital, he need not be concerned as to the form of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.371" offset="13944874">If it is a purported loan, if it is a guaranty but in fact constitutes a contribution to capital, he has the tools already and he has the decisions by which he can have such capital so treat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.645" offset="14017912">Now, there has been in --</text>

            <text syncTime="3479.759" offset="14022405">It is your contention then that this doctrine for which you're contending applied only in a situation like this, where -- where the guarantor pay the debtor (Inaudible) the debtor become (Inaudible) would have to furnish to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3500.109" offset="14103803">And the reason why we contended only applies in such situation as this if at the time the guarantor performs his guaranty, the principal debtor has assets, then he has procured something of a value.</text>

            <text syncTime="3530.451" offset="14225220">I think that it -- that the law requires this, if at the time of the performance of the guaranty, the right acquired by subrogation has some value.</text>

            <text syncTime="3543.398" offset="14276942">I -- I think to the extent that the right has value, then it does become a debt and would thereafter be treated as one to the extent that the right acquired where subrogation does not have value, then it is a loss that resulted from the transaction entered into for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.736" offset="14338278">Because up until that time there has been no asset, there has been nothing of value in the hands of the taxpayer that could become worthless.</text>
