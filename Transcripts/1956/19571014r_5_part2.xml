            <label>Mr. Oscar H. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="3.488" offset="13897">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.319" offset="25182">In the minutes I have remaining I would like to first of all to state categorically to the Court, because I believe that it is supported by the various elements of legislative history, which we have set forth in our supplemental brief on re-argument, that Congress desired in this 1950 statute as it had in the predecessor 1940 statute to deport all members of the Communist Party who were in, no matter how long ago, their membership, no matter how short a period of their membership, no matter what their knowledge of the unlawful aims and objectives of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.634" offset="174498">It was a sweeping position which Congress took.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.391" offset="193515">One piece of legislative history which we believe is significant, I'd like to read to the Court, it's printed at pages 14 and 15 of our supplemental brief on re-argument, (Inaudible) of the two government briefs, and it's the Senate Report on the 1940 statute, which for the first time made past membership in the Communist Party deportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.160" offset="296542">As the Court will recall in 1939 on the case of Kessler against Strecker in 307 United States, the Court held that under the statute which then existed, that is the 1918 statute, as it has been amended, you had to find that the alien was a member of the Communist Party at the time of the hearing in order to deport him and then the Court reversed the deportation order against Strecker because there was no evidence that he was a member and had not been found, that he was a member of the Communist Party at the time of the hearing, there was evidence the he'd been a prior member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.621" offset="442410">The Court said in that case that, that wasn't enough under the statute as it then read.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.012" offset="464039">Mr. Justice Roberts opinion for the Court says in the absence of express and explicit wording by Congress, we are unwilling to assume that Congress had wished to deport aliens who had membership in the Communist Party long time past or for shorter in the Court's opinion and to the decision in the Kessler against Strecker case, because a year later in 1940, they amended the statute to provide for deportation of past members and we think the quotation from the Senate's report which was repeated in the conference report is significant because it says in the past membership, this is on page 15 in the parenthesis at the end of the quotation, "For no matter how short a time or how far in the past, so long as it was after the date of entry."</text>
            <text syncTime="165.250" offset="660898">This was as Justice Jackson said in Harisiades case, an extreme example of the use of the expulsion power and Congress intended that it be so.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.897" offset="711576">And so we think that it would be going contrary to the intention of Congress as it has been manifested in these statutes which have become more and more severe in relation to deportation of subversives over the years beginning in 1918, 1920, 1940, 1950, 1952, we think it is clear from this course of legislative history that Congress did not wish to exclude a man because he didn't know that the Communist Party advocated unlawful objectives or even if he may not have had full and complete knowledge of that, but he didn't have an inkling that they had unlawful objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.593" offset="874371">In the cases which have come before the Court, particularly in the Harisiades case, there were records in which at least I think two of the aliens involved in that case, there were three aliens involved in the Harisiades case in 1952, Harisiades himself, Mrs. Coleman and Mascitti.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.291" offset="949081">As to Mrs. Coleman, there was no indication whatsoever that she had any inkling, you might say of the unlawful or undesirable character of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.060" offset="988160">As to Mascitti there was very slight bet as to Harisiades that was considerably more, but there that Court had before it records in which at least as to one of the aliens there was less knowledge of the activities of the Communist Party than there is in the case of Rowoldt who was before the Court and yet the statute was upheld as to those individuals.</text>

            <text syncTime="456.880" offset="1827422">But if you join the Communist Party and even in the days of 1935 and since that Communist Party was on the ballot in so many states, it would be, and particularly with a literate man like Rowoldt, it would he hard to believe that he didn't know he was joining a party, well he may not have been interested in certain aspects of the party or not care, but he knew he was joining a political party, as the Court said in Rowoldt, an active and distinct political organization and my submission is that under the whole legislative history, that's enough, that's what Congress intended to cover.</text>

            <text syncTime="589.225" offset="2356872">Well I think that unless there was some -- my suggestion is that unless there were some outside proof that he knew that the change was more than a mere change in name, then he would fall under the Carter and Skevington rule but if he just thought let's call it the Communist Party as it could be called the Farmer Labor Party or The Progressive Party or some other party, but if there was some other evidence as we think there clearly is here, it would not fall under that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.862" offset="2459376">Before I sit down, I would -- if I may I would like to make two other suggestions to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.335" offset="2489260">The first is that this entire administrative proceeding, though it occurred before the Galvan decision, occurred after Public Law 14, the Act of March 28, 1951, which the Galvan decision expiated on because that Act was passed on March 28, 1951 which happened to be precise date on which his deportation hearing was held before the Special Inquiry Officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.888" offset="2595527">So the Special Inquiry Officer, and shortly thereafter the immigration service issued a new regulation under the -- as required under that Act, so the Special Inquiry Officer, the Commissioner of Immigration and the Board of Immigration appeal, decided this case entirely after the Act of March 28, 1951 was on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.087" offset="2680268">In the same connection I should that say that Rowoldt petitioned for suspension of deportation very belatedly in 1955 before the Board of Immigration Appeals and it was denied for three separate reasons, but there was no -- there was opportunity for the Board of Immigration Appeals to raise this issue of membership that he didn't have sufficient membership and it was not done.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.297" offset="2785176">He had never raised it administratively throughout the administrative proceedings even though it was -- the administrative proceedings as I say took place after the Act of March 28, 1951, he didn't raise the issue that he wasn't the type of member covered by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.240" offset="2840869">As far as I can determine he didn't raise that issue until he got to this Court and certainly he didn't raise it in the administrative proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.161" offset="2872633">He didn't even raise it before the Board of Immigration Appeals when he applied belatedly for suspension of deportation in 1951.</text>

            <text syncTime="890.588" offset="3562266">May it please the Court, Mr. Davis says that there are two possible inferences from this record as to whether the petitioner was or was not a nominal member and that the administrator has the right to make the choice of inferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.453" offset="3621721">If the administrator had that right nothing is clear than that he did not exercise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.693" offset="3646694">In this record there are three opinions of the administrator, an opinion of the Special Inquiry Officer who was the hearing examiner, an opinion of the Chief of the Adjudications Division and an opinion of the Board of Immigration Appeals, and if the Court will read those opinions, it is perfectly plain that each one of those officials thought that the only question was whether the individual ever was any -- was a member of the Communist Party and nothing, no appreciation at all is shown of such a thing as whether or not he was more than a nominal member.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.798" offset="3795174">The things that Mr. Davis relies on in arguing to this Court, as proving more than nominal membership are not even mentioned in two of the opinions in holding that the evidence is sufficient to show membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.732" offset="3854838">The opinion of the Board of Immigration Appeals does not mention the fact that Mr. Rowoldt sold books in a bookstore.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.867" offset="3887438">It does not mention the fact that he went down to City Hall and asked for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.670" offset="3906664">The same thing, neither of those items are mentioned in the opinion of the Chief of the Adjudications section.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.972" offset="3931847">The opinion of the hearing examiner mentions it incidentally, but the hearing examiner makes a finding that membership in the Communist Party is established independently by each of two separate documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.495" offset="3993913">One of those two documents is the statement that Rowoldt gave to the immigration examiner which the Court is fully familiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.274" offset="4029022">The other is the bare statement in Rowoldt's application, earlier applications for writ of habeas corpus in which all he said was that he was a member of the Communist Party, that he had left the Communist Party in 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.958" offset="4087745">So that the hearing examiner himself felt that merely one statement, the statement that he had once been a member of the Communist Party was enough to prove deportability under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.172" offset="4128601">So if the administrator has a right to make the choice, he did not make it and if anything more is needed to prove that it is what the history of the Garcia case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.997" offset="4171964">In Garcia the Solicitor General opposed certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.575" offset="4186279">It was only after this Court decided Galvan in the government's favor and only after the Court granted certiorari in Galvan that the Solicitor General decided that perhaps there was some obscurity in the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.285" offset="4257123">And it is plain now that at least at times, because I think Mr. Davis' concept of nominal membership has varied from time to time, that at least the deprives of his argument, the government as represented by him is still applying the wrong meaning of nominal membership, because if I heard him rightly he is still says at times at least that it is enough to make a person a nominal member if he knows the correct name of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.133" offset="4364434">If he knows that the organization had the name of Communist Party and wasn't -- didn't have the name of Workers Alliance, that's enough to make him more than a nominal member.</text>
