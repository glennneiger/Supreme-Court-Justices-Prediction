            <text syncTime="47.267" offset="292446">This case concerns the validity of a cease and desist order issued by the Federal Trade Commission which order the Commission feels is necessary to terminate a price fixing conspiracy that existed in the lead pigments industry for nearly a quarter of a century.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.786" offset="402474">The complaint charged that suppression of price competition was accomplished by dividing the country into geographic zones and that the respondents charged the same delivered prices to all buyers within a particular zone, irregardless of the location of the buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.626" offset="509889">The Commission alleged and found that the respondents' use of this system permitted the respondents to exactly match the prices of their competitors at every single point in the country, in every single zone, which was drawn by the response.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.072" offset="599646">And that there was no price competition among the purchasers of this product as a result of the alleged price fixing conspiracy.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="135.436" offset="645099">Mr. Kitner, did they break it down within the zones so that there could be a great many different prices within this zone depending upon what each other charged or -- or was it blocked out zone by zone where there must be one price?</text>

            <label>Mr. Earl W. Kintner</label>
            <text syncTime="150.777" offset="706435">It was blocked out, Your Honor, zone by zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.586" offset="721690">There -- and here again, the pricing structure buried with the three principal products in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.427" offset="765053">There were varying zones allocated to each product.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.720" offset="778219">In general, there was a par zone and then additional zones to which differentials were added and the respondent sold at the same price to all buyers within each zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.002" offset="847391">That was the crux, a difference per portion of the price fixing agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.260" offset="876440">The order prohibited a conspiracy or agreement to sell at prices determined according to the zone delivered price system, or any system resulting in identical prices at the points of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.826" offset="934640">And additionally, the order prohibited the respondents from individually quoting and selling pursuant to a zone delivered pricing system, for the purpose or with the effect of systematically matching the delivered prices of other sellers of lead pigments, thereby, depriving purchasers all the benefits of price competition in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.027" offset="1055431">I think it is essential and it is this portion of the order that I have just mentioned that is at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.938" offset="1099107">I think it is essential to refer to the findings of fact in this case because it is in the context of those findings that the Commission feels that it has exercised an allowable judgment in drafting this particular portion of the order in question in requiring the respondents to individually to each cease and desist from the use of a system of zone delivered prices with the purpose and with the effect of systematically matching the prices of their competitors in this industry.</text>

            <label>Mr. Earl W. Kintner</label>
            <text syncTime="300.915" offset="1307042">The court below sustained the Commission's portion of the order as to conspiracy and that is not at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.022" offset="1359496">The respondent, National, according to the findings, is the dominant factor in the lead pigments industry, controlling an excess of 50% of the products manufactured by that industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.161" offset="1416025">Eagle-Picher controls a substantial portion of the remainder of the industry's products which are white lead in oil used principally as a -- as a partly mixed paint and sold to the dealers, to the painters and to consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.036" offset="1515499">A dry white lead, the second product which is primarily sold to manufacturers of paint and lead oxides which are including red lead and litharge which are sold primarily or the -- as a principle constituent in the manufacturer of battery place but also sold as -- in the instance of red lead as a constituent of red lead paint.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.916" offset="1651022">The picture in the industry prior to 1933 is an -- is a picture of an industry dominated by few manufacturers and by a dwindling number of manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.086" offset="1711731">Although the industry had a dwindling number of factors prior to that time, it was also characterized by at least some vestiges of localized price competition, for instance, the National, the largest factory in the industry and the dominant factor in the industry add 589 points in 40 space where the prices were either equalized or where the points were free delivery points.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.011" offset="1863450">A somewhat somewhere but a different situation existed with respect to the pricing structure of Eagle-Picher.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.245" offset="1904306">(Inaudible), one of the respondents which also sells paint in its own company own stores said, through one of its representatives in the trial of this case, that's difficulty was in attempting to locate the equalization of points of its larger competitors in order to follow the price so that there was indeed a considerable amount of price competition prior to 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.665" offset="2042023">This was also, as has been pointed out by the Commission in its findings, a -- a relatively complicated pricing system in which one competitor can never be sure unless he knew in advance of his -- of competitors pricing structure, unless, he knew in advance of the exact equalization points and also if he had advanced knowledge of the exact freightage used.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.549" offset="2165530">There are also other practices in problem in the industry, a difference in many instances of conditions and terms of sale and there was the practice of diversification at which orders would be accepted under old price -- on an old price in the face of new increased prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.972" offset="2275244">This was a picture of the industry prior to NRA days.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.474" offset="2301262">Then in connection with the drafting of a code of fair competition under NRA, meetings were held in July of 1933 through January of 1934 for the purpose of drafting a code of fair competition for this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.329" offset="2368658">There was discussion of -- during these meetings of -- for -- of a uniform basis of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.558" offset="2401573">A telegram from the Secretary of the Association says as follows, "Block referring to the counsel for the -- for the Industry Trade Association, a lease agreement upon suggested uniform basis of sale pending approval from Washington to code might place us on uncertain legal ground and might be embarrassing later and stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.790" offset="2498539">He suggest one member to use uniform basis and others follow voluntarily."</text>
            <text syncTime="606.214" offset="2528214">That was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.971" offset="2543261">There was discussion of a uniform agency or consignment method of selling which the president of National, stated at a meeting, quote, " Permits us to control the resale price."</text>
            <text syncTime="624.478" offset="2601253">Now, this control of the resale price was necessary because Glidden and Sherwin-Williams, two of the relatively minor but very competitive factors in the industry, own their own paint stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.975" offset="2659244">And it was necessary that the method be devised so that the prices to the consumers across the boards would be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.951" offset="2703130">Commission found that the respondents agreed to and did sell white lead and oil at delivered prices in 12 zones, one, a par zone, and the remainder premium zones varying from 12.5 cents per $100 to $1 per 100 varying as to zones.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.157" offset="2780035">There was a also a par zone in the San Francisco Bay area, the other par zone being roughly in the North Central and Northeastern United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.657" offset="2822040">The dry white lead was a product that was sold according to a par zone up to the Rocky Mountains with a premium zone beyond the Rocky Mountains.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.242" offset="2868328">And the findings indicate that prior to this time, the product actually sold at less beyond the Rocky Mountains and it did east of the Rocky's.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.416" offset="2925066">There was a different -- slightly different arrangement with respect to lead oxides.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.320" offset="2948681">There were two-zone, the zoning systems for this product.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.765" offset="2966444">One, for less than carload sales and one for carload sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.888" offset="2994970">The less than carload sales had a par and four premium zones, the carload, two par zones and one premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.180" offset="3028093">There were other arrangements made, first for a -- for a consignment basis for the sale of white lead in oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.667" offset="3074069">And then, there were uniform discounts in terms of sales or these products including dry and white lead.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.919" offset="3111058">Uniform differentials between the case in which the product -- the lead and oil products were sold.See, all of that was necessary in order to effectuate the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.508" offset="3165393">The parties also agreed to eliminate guarantees against price decline.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.469" offset="3197262">Lead -- red lead and litharge sold on the basis of six differentials over the big lead prices of the American Smelting and Refining Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.031" offset="3247522">In the minutes, concerning this transaction, it was said, it was agreed in deference to existing statues that no reference to prices should appear in the outlines except for the specification that prices were to be agreed upon between the buyer and the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.417" offset="3321083">Interestingly enough, the parties met -- had to meet a situation where National's, Dutch Boy brand, was a dominate brand in the industry and possessed the -- a great deal of consumer acceptance and where Eagle-Picher also had a brand well known accepted by the public, the Eagle brand of paint that by no means is well known or is accepted by the consumers as National's Dutch Boy brand.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.350" offset="3460786">So the arrangement was made that the other -- the products, the lesser known products of the respondents should be sold to the dealers at a differential of 25 cents for 100 pounds less in order to encourage the dealers to push the sale of the lesser known brands.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.209" offset="3568201">But to the consumers, the price was the same across the board's regardless of whether it was Dutch Boy paint or pigment are regardless of whether it was a much lesser known brand or indeed a brand that was not known to the consumers at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.086" offset="3647718">This was the only method by which the dominant respondents, National Eagle and Eagle-Picher could induce the two paint manufacturers, Sherwin-Williams and Glidden, to continue into -- in this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.084" offset="3727757">The price in uniformity existing is indicated by the fact that between 1935 and 1941, 16 deferent bids were submitted by National Eagle &amp; Sherwin-Williams to the City of Cincinnati, 11 of those bids were identical to the fourth decimal point.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.274" offset="3808423">And it is not in mitigation that the bids, all the respondents to the three federal government agencies were completely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.459" offset="3861191">The same situation as to uniformity of bids also applied according to the findings and bids submitted to the City of Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.360" offset="3900792">So in like of these facts, which the Commission found existed pursuant to agreement and conspiracy and resulted in absolute absence of price competition in this industry for almost a quarter of the century, I believe it comes in for grace or the respondents' status they do in their brief and I quote, point two of the brief "the injunction with hamper competition in this industry."</text>
            <text syncTime="986.460" offset="4049168">My question is what competition in the industry would be a hamper.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.863" offset="4078843">The pricing system, the lawfulness of which say they so stably defend is a very one that is a cornerstone and the essence of the conspiracy setup in 1933 and 1934 and which prevails to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.315" offset="4168600">Also, respondents have said, such an order would needlessly restrict the lead pigment manufactures and deprive them of a valid competitive weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.219" offset="4228263">In the context of this case, if the Court please, this system of zone delivered pricing has not banned a valid competitive weapon and has not been so used the Commission seeks effectively to divest the respondents of that weapon.</text>

            <text syncTime="3456.679" offset="13930036">There was no application on the part of respondents to delay it because of the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.690" offset="13950098">They delay it solely attributed to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.946" offset="13963160">From 1946 on, we held hearings all over the country and we finished in the fall of 1947, we filed our briefs shortly before Christmas of 1947, the trial examiner's recommended decision came down March 31st, 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.090" offset="14051767">There was one final argument so called before the Commission in February 19 and January 1949, then the case was set down for reargument on February 1st and 2nd, 1950 and having been changes in the Commission's personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.118" offset="14127835">And it was three years later, in January 1953, that the order here was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.414" offset="14156988">Now, Mr. Justice Brennan, you were asking about that telegram from Mr. (Inaudible) and the somewhat naive advice that he'd received from counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.083" offset="14199724">We have always maintained and the record shows this that what they we're talking about had nothing to do with zone pricing of price fixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.319" offset="14248626">It had to do with terms of sale, and perhaps credit terms when delivery should be made but the counsel was super cautious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.207" offset="14296168">And however, the Commission went to find that although the matter of uniform contracts of sale, was discussed, there was no evidence and no showing that such uniform contract were ever adopted or used generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.878" offset="14366908">And that's from the record, volume 5, page 3776.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.843" offset="14394702">Now, let's again get this case back to its proper prospective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.561" offset="14421661">This is the first time in this entire litigation since 1944 and it's the first time since the order was issued that I've heard anybody representing the Commission say that this order merely prevents nationwide matching of zone prices and does not prevent local, regular meeting of prices in good faith competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.012" offset="14543391">As we read the order, it applies to both situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.541" offset="14561573">In other words, this order, and certainly, we would advice our clients that they couldn't use a zoned system where either the purpose to meet a low price of the competitor or the effect without any purpose would be regularly to meet a competitor's price in any given area and I certainly don't think it can be stated that this merely applies to a nationwide precise fixing of prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.704" offset="14690200">Now, again, I think it's important to note that ultimately, as Mr. Kintner said, the Commission feels that without this part of the order, which was rejected by the court below, the same pricing pattern will continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.070" offset="14767626">Well, I know, we have advised our client, and I'm sure that other counsel for the other respondents advised their clients that when the order against conspiracy which is -- will be in effect, no question about that, does actually go into effect, they've got to change their pricing system radically for we feel that if a merely continuance to use a same pricing pattern under the teaching of the Morgan case and the Borden case and the Socony-Vacuum case, they would merely be continuing acts having their origin in illegal agreement and would be held to renew the illegal agreement by just continuing to do the same thing regardless of any actual meaning of the mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.362" offset="14956857">I think the law is settled on there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.759" offset="14966366">Now, what will this order do?</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.148" offset="14983920">Let's take National Lead as an example, it has six white lead plants, it not merely in the east, a string from New York all the way to San Francisco, it has nine oxide plants which supply the material for battery manufactures, those are located in the east and the southeast in Texas, in Los Angeles, in San Francisco and in the midwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.915" offset="15094993">Suppose National Lead were to adopt its new entirely different from any system involved here is new, nondiscriminatory zone method, withdraw the zone boundaries so there'd be no question of -- of possibility of injury to competing purchases in contiguous zones.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.577" offset="15193631">Now, there is nothing in this order which would prevent National Lead if it acted initially from setting up its own zone pricing system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.547" offset="15237517">Then what would happen to the others, almost no other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.084" offset="15267715">So, acceptance of very smallest pods has the advantage of location.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.118" offset="15291852">Suppose Sherwin-Williams, Glidden, Eagle-Picher wanted to compete for certain business in a particular area by lowering their delivered zone price to meet National's, which as we read the Act is permitted by Section 2 (b) under Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.163" offset="15384012">Under this order, they couldn't do that as we read it, at least they couldn't do it if they regularly try to get that business because we think that the word systematically means the same thing as regularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.803" offset="15446601">Now, what would happen?</text>
            <text syncTime="3838.077" offset="15455692">Are these smaller sellers suppose to go out of business and yet as we read this order, that's what would happen, whereas they say, all right you can use some other method and meet prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3850.304" offset="15504593">Well, why is it any difference?</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.878" offset="15514833">Why is it noncompetitive to use a competitive individually established zone method of pricing if anybody wants because the customers want it and competitively meet prices were necessary.W</text>
            <text syncTime="3866.573" offset="15569690">hy is one bad and the use of say, an FOB freight equalize system to meet the lower prices of another is perfectly all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.483" offset="15613262">They say it's in the context of this page.</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.507" offset="15625383">Well, we say in the context of this case, we've got to make radical changes and when we do make radical changes, they're going to be fully competitive zone pricing if the customers want it, or perhaps there will be some other method, I don't know, we can't tell it this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3898.716" offset="15698213">And also to get this case into it's proper setting, this Court should know that this particular idea that respondent should be enjoined from using individually employed zone pricing where in any area of the country, there might be meeting of prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3924.713" offset="15802180">It was drag into the case after the hearings, after the filing of the trial examiner's recommended decision and by counsel for the Commission would made no argument even before on this point had restricted his contention to the conspiracy issue but counsel brought it in on this theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.807" offset="15898624">He said that count one of the amended complaint actually does charge, that the individual use of zone pricing is an unfair method of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3958.974" offset="15939271">There -- the Commission, in ruling on his exception said, oh no, paragraphs 8 to 10 which he was relying on, merely spell out, how the conspiracy was carried out and it did not allege separately and distinctly that the individual use of zones was an unfair method of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.206" offset="16040208">As a matter of fact, the Commission in his ruling said, if it have been the Commission's intentions to charge that the acts of each of the respondents individually were unlawful, it could and undoubtedly would have so alleged in clear and unambiguous terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.013" offset="16131427">That's their own construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.666" offset="16138010">However, they said, despite that, we think that in order to extricate the effects of the conspiracy and to guarantee against its continuation, this type of order is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4022.633" offset="16193912">Under these circumstances, the respondents were given no opportunity to meet the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.186" offset="16220139">They could, we believe, now there is nothing in the record on this, have brought full testimony showing that zone delivered pricing was desired by customers, that competitive products, and we must keep this in mind here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4046.261" offset="16288371">White lead in oil is a paint, it's not quite a finished paint but it's sold as a paint product and you remember the old master painter who used to add his own thinners and oils and mix it up and apply, dry white lead, sold to paint manufacturers as an ingredient in ready mix of paint, directly competes with titanium, pigments, with lithotone and with lead and zinc oxide.</text>
            <text syncTime="4073.144" offset="16395995">Lead oxides are more or less sui generis but many battery manufacturers manufacture their own needs of lead oxide.</text>
            <text syncTime="4086.095" offset="16447718">Now, since we were denied that opportunity, and since we say that the statute, Section 5 of the Clayton Act, clearly, and without any ambiguity, states how the Commission may go about declaring a method, the unfair and showing that the Commission is limited to preventing illegal acts bound to be illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.078" offset="16591705">We say that we would deny due process and that the court below correctly struck from the order this particular provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4132.308" offset="16632560">Now, we keep hearing about the device or the cornerstone of the conspiracy was this zone pricing system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4142.843" offset="16674774">Well, I say that there is no such thing as a zone pricing system except in a very broad sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4151.330" offset="16708733">Now, there are four broad methods of delivered pricing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4156.038" offset="16727542">You got the -- the right equalization, the basing point, the universal price throughout a nation and zone price.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.602" offset="16777801">Now, the facts of this case show that zones may differ radically in size, in area, in location of zone boundaries and in price differentials between boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.633" offset="16833912">For instance, the white lead in oil agreement, illegal agreement concerned 13 zones.</text>
            <text syncTime="4193.656" offset="16878007">Dry white lead had only two zones, a par zone up to the Rocky Mountain, and slightly higher west of the Rocky's upon which many products in this country are sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="4206.367" offset="16928789">As a matter of fact, the Commission conceives that the white lead in oil zone were altogether different from dry white zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.897" offset="16954911">Now, what importance is that?</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.778" offset="16970480">Importance is that there's no such specific device as a zone pricing system except in that very broad generic sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4228.974" offset="17019277">And if National Lead, for instance, were to individually adopt its none discriminatory zones, it could have all sorts of zone for the different products which would be totally different from these zones that the -- the court below found were established through illegal agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="4297.962" offset="17295235">As a matter of fact, the trial examiner found that the freight element laid in a delivered price here ran from only 2.5 or 3.5% of the -- of the delivered price.</text>

            <text syncTime="4317.818" offset="17374647">Well, again, the Commission also in effect conceded that all lead pigments were sold at very low margins over the cost of pigment lead which represented 98% of the -- of the lead pigments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4335.883" offset="17446954">Now, lead pigment prices generally tended to fall increases or decreases in pigment lead, and most of the respondents here have to buy their pigment lead from outside people that are not involved in this case, it means, in other words, National Lead has to -- has to buy on the open market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4354.737" offset="17522291">It doesn't produce its own lead from which it makes lead pigments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4369.006" offset="17579447">Now, I think it's important to know as some of Your Honors have mentioned that in the new Cement case, 333 U.S., involving the multiple basing point system, where the respondents before this Court had objected to certain portions of the Commission's order, this Court took paints to observe that the entire order there was predicate on conspiratorial action and it specifically noted that the order did not prohibit individual, non-collusive, delivered prices similarly in the Gypsum case which was a Sherman Act proceeding, the defendant there had said that the District Court's decree might be deemed to prevent individual, non-collusive delivered pricing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.649" offset="17858017">And this Court modify the District Court's decree, despite the fact that it said the District Court has brought powers in bringing it decree, same argument made here so as expressly to permit individual, non-collusive delivered prices.</text>

            <text syncTime="4590.545" offset="18465520">As a matter of fact, this case is wholly stranger or strange in the light of the consent decree entered against the steel industry in 1951, two years before this order was issued.</text>

            <text syncTime="4659.785" offset="18742523">And then, in the 1932, the Commission, in its study of the basing point formula said, probably the most important, single, determinative factor in adopting the use of the delivered price uniform for all destinations is the ratio of the delivered cost to total production and delivery cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.353" offset="18844818">If this is low, with only slight differences and delivery cost, as between destinations freight wise differently located a delivered price uniform for zones may be a method of quoting more convenient to buyer and seller and less costly than an FOB point of origin price.</text>
            <text syncTime="4710.685" offset="18946069">In that case, such a price would not be inconsistent with price competition, and would not be indicative of any lack of such competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4719.261" offset="18980446">Well, here, I pointed, the freight factor was only 2.5%-3.5% of the delivered price.</text>
            <text syncTime="4726.234" offset="19008345">And the other circumstances would make a different zone system, a different form the old system agreed upon for a right within that definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4738.274" offset="19056515">And again, in 1948, the Commission said, where uniformity of delivered prices within a zone all throughout the country has simple and logical explanations in the nature of the market, the product and the transportation cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="4792.768" offset="19274480">I don't think we would have any quarrel before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4795.612" offset="19285870">I don't think such an order would have been necessary because I think the order banning continuation of the conspiracy itself requires some substantial change in your pricing so that you can show the Court it's such necessity -- if such be necessary, all the Commission that you've actually abandoned your old prices.</text>
