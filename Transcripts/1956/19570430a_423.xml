            <text syncTime="106.209" offset="528175">We have under the merit system, political activity is prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.777" offset="550431">Here's where the borderline will come in these meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.132" offset="559940">It's difficult to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.184" offset="568090">Except that they have a right to say one will vote or against.</text>

            <text syncTime="129.929" offset="623052">Now, it seems to me that which one all of these things, that could be provided for by the State in its wisdom would be for the legislature to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.117" offset="675819">Maybe some or all of them might constitutionally be prohibited by stand of state employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.963" offset="703195">They cannot belong to a union which engages in these activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.619" offset="721899">Certainly, that's true as to collective-bargaining.</text>

            <text syncTime="161.294" offset="748544">You can't read them all and you can't keep up with all them in all the state court decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.396" offset="768920">But I believe this Court has said somewhere along the line that collective-bargaining has no place in public employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.442" offset="821164">Now, the District Court has said when this case was before it, contention was made that this Solomon Act which has been read to you all is unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.300" offset="872573">Well, if there is any discrimination in this Act it appears on its page.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.297" offset="896606">The District Court said, we don't say there's no way to construe this Act in a constitutional manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.039" offset="935476">If it had been unconstitutional on its face for any reason, would there have been any logical reason for abstaining and sending the case back to the state court?</text>
            <text syncTime="220.972" offset="987303">Wouldn't if federal court have proceeded, is there no way other than to say it's unconstitutional, would have struck down right then.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.004" offset="1023352">And when it came up here wouldn't this Court have said, â€œNo.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.306" offset="1040593">We are not going to affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.314" offset="1052609">There is no possible way it can be constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.607" offset="1065775">So, why send it back?"</text>
            <text syncTime="242.997" offset="1075388">This Court didn't do this -- do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.728" offset="1082284">It affirmed to stay in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.363" offset="1100779">Now, when the union -- and I'll make this point whether there's anything to it or not, I don't know what I'm going to mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.596" offset="1129723">Up to that time, the -- the employee have seen and the union have been thriving together.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.758" offset="1158353">But when they started in the in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County seeking a construction of this statute, the employee member was dropped or he didn't participate in the suit.And the union alone brought it.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.411" offset="1216972">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="278.656" offset="1218017">I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.593" offset="1221778">The other side may answer that (Inaudible) anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.674" offset="1242049">And then the issue was formulated there.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.034" offset="1251558">It seems like it was studiously avoided to bring in any question about the constitutionality of Solomon Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.782" offset="1282487">Now, we want you to tell us by declaratory judgment because we've got a dispute between us, as to whether or not you are a labor union or a labor organization within the meaning of the Solomon Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1459.232" offset="5940328">I think that a good deal of clarification can be obtained here if we see exactly what the course of this litigation was and why the issues were raised in the places that they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.547" offset="5989543">We start out with the immediately prior to the passage of the Solomon Act with this union which engaged in activities which we will assume for the moment are constitutionally protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.549" offset="6037608">Now, then, the Solomon Act is passed at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.141" offset="6055894">In literal terms the Solomon Act applies to the point of union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.311" offset="6076583">At that point employees begin to leave it and the union goes to a point where from 250 members you end up with one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.785" offset="6110542">We, thereupon, go into the Federal District Court in order to challenge the constitutionality of the Solomon Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.112" offset="6143770">And the Court tells us, "No.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.000" offset="6151398">You can't do that because although perhaps the Solomon Act literally read, is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.891" offset="6190895">We cannot presume that the Alabama courts will so construed it."</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.889" offset="6210957">They then say, "We will abstain from exercising our jurisdiction until such time as a construction of the statute may be obtained from the Alabama courts."</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.056" offset="6259545">Now, then, we go into the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.464" offset="6273233">We file the same complaint because we have the same activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.467" offset="6293191">But because we're doing it in order to obtain a construction so that the constitutional question which is then pending before the District Court, the United States District Court can be raised with the benefit of an authoritative construction of the Act, we then raise it in exactly the manner that Mr. Justice Frankfurter has stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.086" offset="6379708">We put the fact situation before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.500" offset="6393396">At that point having put the fact situation before the Court we say, give us a declaratory judgment on this real controversy which exists between this union and the State of Alabama as to whether this statute on these activities can apply to this union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.364" offset="6468838">Because if it is applied, it would raise serious constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.910" offset="6494960">And we stated specifically in the complaint that the purpose of this action, and this is at pages 77 and 78 of the record.</text>
