            <text syncTime="19.144" offset="179911">If the Court pleases, one of the important questions on this appeal is that question of res judicata, and I would like to address myself to that phase of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.250" offset="232364">And in doing so, I'll refer again briefly to those findings of fact that were made in the prior action, which I've been referred to before, concerning the disposition of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.454" offset="277191">In that prior action, in the --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="45.051" offset="283564">Where do -- where do we find those?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arthur_j_oleary" startTime="46.500" stopTime="381.148">
            <label>Mr. Arthur J. O'Leary</label>
            <text syncTime="46.500" offset="289416">You'll find those, Your Honor, at page 222 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.780" offset="322539">Those findings with respect to income, read in part of many -- some of the words, which I don't think is significant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.114" offset="351796">But so, we'll have the substance of them that the Attorney General is not entitled to receive the income of the said trust which had been accumulated as of the date of the making of the vesting order, referring to the original vesting order.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.381" offset="408848">In number 10, the Attorney General is not entitled to receive any part of the accumulated income held by the trustee, which has been collected since the date of the original vesting order.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.849" offset="458794">And then, Number 11, that the Attorney General as Alien Property Custodian is not entitled to receive any income, which may be collected during the lifetime of Bruno Reinicke, his set law and said trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.559" offset="513651">Now, I would like to show in a practical way how that prior judgment will be circumvented, and I think in part destroyed, if the Attorney General gets the relief that he seeks in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.814" offset="562657">And I can demonstrate that by asking Your Honor to look or to take my description of it at the schedule of the account at page 260 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.891" offset="610931">Unmet schedule is listed in a few items.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.254" offset="628381">What happened to the accumulated income and the amount of it?</text>
            <text syncTime="135.960" offset="647189">At page 260 of the record, it shows that there has been accumulated in these trusts and headed to the corpus, the total sum of $116,576.75.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.252" offset="704345">That is the income that had been accumulated in that accumulated cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.756" offset="726392">That is the income which those findings of fact that I referred to, refer to.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.302" offset="756590">That income was adjudged to be in the possession and -- and it should remain a possession of the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.433" offset="789086">Now, it's the Attorney General who gets the relief that he asks for here.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.510" offset="809462">That income will be turned over to the Attorney General, and to that extent, that prior judgment would be circumvented and in part, destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.207" offset="848227">Now, in arguing at the prior action, I had nothing to do with either possession or the vesting of the race.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.246" offset="896397">It certainly would seem to be the correct fact that the prior judgment did have something to do with possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.610" offset="925863">Certainly, plainly so, with respect to that accumulated income which I have just described, the possession of that was litigated in past time.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.371" offset="960867">And furthermore, I think the vesting of the race itself was a matter which was the subject of the litigation in the prior action.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.070" offset="999633">And I say that basing it upon the language of the original vesting order, that original vesting order which is printed at -- beginning at page 67 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.189" offset="1060133">In the opening part of it, it refers to property described as, “all right title and interest” of Bruno Reinicke and others as being property payable to enemy nationals.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.593" offset="1125752">Because I might say though, that such property, is in the process of administration by the Chase National Bank as trustee of its trust dated so and so, under the judicial supervision of the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.146" offset="1179982">Now, when I say that in that original order, they refer to something in addition to the right title and interest of the aliens, they are vesting also the very property itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.174" offset="1224077">When they use the words “property” in the process of administration, I don't think the man who wrote that intended to say or imply that they were -- that they were administrating rights and interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.698" offset="1274128">He meant, the securities would be in, and the trustee itself was being administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.874" offset="1298892">And that I think is evident by what follows was that paragraph, beginning at the top of page 71, which reads, “Hereby vest in the Alien Property Custodian, the property described above to be held used, administered, liquidated, sold or otherwise dealt with.”</text>
            <text syncTime="319.606" offset="1381752">Now, we don't liquidate and sell rights and interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.893" offset="1402964">At language, it's only fitted to me the securities, the funds that comprise the purpose of this trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.822" offset="1434624">Now, the Attorney General labels this original vesting order that I have just quoted as a right title and interest order.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.936" offset="1483107">And he said, “That was all up before the Court in the prior action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="348.525" offset="1497422">But that -- that original order contain that language that I referred to referring to properties that can be bought and sold which I say refers to the purpose of the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.404" offset="1532949">Now, if we look at the so-called raised vesting order, which, however, in this preparation by the Alien Property Custodian was labelled as an amendment to the original vesting order, the language of that is not legally different from the language of the original order.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.905" offset="1614973">There, the same nationals I referred to --</text>

          <turn speaker="arthur_j_oleary" startTime="382.359" stopTime="439.235">
            <label>Mr. Arthur J. O'Leary</label>
            <text syncTime="382.359" offset="1632841">That -- that begins at page 72 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.692" offset="1658128">The opening part of it, they referred to enemy nationals.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.790" offset="1670562">And then, on page 74, in paragraph 2, they say, “All property in the custody of the Chase Bank, its trustee, et cetera.”</text>
            <text syncTime="402.068" offset="1711626">And then, in the last paragraph, page 75, that property just referred to was vested.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.712" offset="1734196">That, I say is the same property that would describe and referred to in the original vesting order, and I don't think there's any illegal significance or any legal difference in the need of either document, and the first document was before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.193" offset="1804100">Now, there is one other phase of this case that I want to refer to.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.568" offset="1833671">The Attorney General wants to relegate the ultimate beneficiary of this fund.</text>

            <text syncTime="447.567" offset="1893648">He -- he demanded that the entire purpose of the trustee turned over to him upon termination of the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.748" offset="1918412">He plainly demanded that.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.197" offset="1928129">Because Bruno Reinicke -- because the trust agreement itself provided that all income shall be added to principles and -- unless Bruno Reinicke directed it to go otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.610" offset="1977762">The Attorney General demanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.229" offset="1984240">He said he had seized that right and he demanded the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.173" offset="2000018">Now, also, in the Court of Appeals, and that part of it --</text>

            <text syncTime="479.733" offset="2022275">Now, and he also -- there's a dispute about this part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.480" offset="2041292">The appellants claim the Attorney General and his -- and the Court of Appeals demanded the entire purpose, but the petitioner puts a different construction on that and he says, “He did only by way of argument.”</text>
            <text syncTime="498.639" offset="2097925">He says, “If he can't get it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="500.350" offset="2104822">He said, “He argued there, but he couldn't get despite to direct income.”</text>
            <text syncTime="504.421" offset="2121017">Then, the trust had terminated, and therefore, he went to the entire principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.014" offset="2143378">Now, I want to say a few words about that Section 9 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="515.190" offset="2164172">If the Attorney General gets the relief that he wants in this action, then the ultimate remainder of the trust, if it turns out to be this American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.948" offset="2199176">So, the Attorney General says, “He has a right to come in under Section 9 (a), and bring a suit for recovery.”</text>
            <text syncTime="530.212" offset="2224253">But, we must bear in mind that there's a statute of limitations on claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.856" offset="2266781">Anybody who claims to be entitled a property that's taken over by the Alien Property Custodian must bring a suit no later than two years from the date of vesting all seizure as statute of limitations of the 50 U.S.C. Section 33.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.236" offset="2336266">Now, this trust, as we already know, will not terminate until the two lives are being expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.111" offset="2367822">Now, that may be ex number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.298" offset="2376600">If it's 10, 11, or 20 by that time, the rights of the argument remained in them with a long sense of vanished under that statute of limitations.</text>
