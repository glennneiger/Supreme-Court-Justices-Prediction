            <text syncTime="48.606" offset="297775">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.928" offset="307075">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.069" offset="327659">The question presented arises out of a strike by the Oil Workers International Union against Lion Oil Company at its El Dorado, Arkansas Chemical Plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.626" offset="381889">That question is whether the strike which occurred in 1952 was outlawed under the sixty-day cooling-off requirement of Section 8 (d) of the National Labor Relations Act as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.226" offset="440299">The facts, if I may summarize them briefly in the frame of reference of the Board's findings in this case were as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.189" offset="472168">Since 1944, the union and the company had engaged in collective bargaining and had entered into successive contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.610" offset="513860">The contract here involved was executed on October 23rd, 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.846" offset="538728">It provided that its duration was one year and thereafter unless terminated by notice of the parties, of either party.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.539" offset="569553">It further provided that if either party desired modifications, a sixty-day notice should be given and thereupon there would be bargaining and such a notice was given by the union on the first date under the provisions of the contract when it might be given to it August 24, 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.585" offset="657742">Attach to its notice to -- of desire to modify was a list of contract proposals, concurrently with the notice, the union also sent to modification to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and to the Arkansas Commissioner of Labor as is required under Section 3 (d) of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.848" offset="754813">Numerous bargaining sessions ensued, progress was made with a view to contract changes but by February 14, 1952, when it appeared to the union that the bargaining had bugged down, it took a strike vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.239" offset="832345">The strike date was subsequently set, it was postponed three times.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.645" offset="857945">And finally on April 30, 1952, a strike was called.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.116" offset="883858">It was engaged in by all of the production and maintenance employees of the companies some 600 in number within the bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.467" offset="917191">The plant was not fully shut down.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.340" offset="928684">It continued in operation with supervisory clerical, technical personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.350" offset="952822">No replacements were hired by the company and bargaining continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.567" offset="977690">After a lapse of nearly two months with the strike in progress, with some production going on, specifically on June 21st, 1952, any bargaining session the spokesman for the union advised that the union was offering to return to work unconditionally all the employees who were out on strike and wanted to know what return to work schedule would be worked out by the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.514" offset="1117393">At that point, the company negotiators stated to the union representatives that the plant would not be reopened and these employees would not be returned to work until its contractual demands were met specifically until the contract was executed for a duration of at least one year with a firm no-strike clause in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.258" offset="1224391">This, the union refused to do and thereupon employees, strikers, individually and in groups presented themselves for employment at the company's employment office.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.717" offset="1278203">Some were hired from time to time but each who was hired was taken back on the express condition that he would continue to work so long as the strike continued and would cross any picket line which might be in existence before the company's plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.752" offset="1366392">Bargaining still continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.258" offset="1376423">And by July, pretty substantial agreement had been reached on a new contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.131" offset="1411845">At that time for the first time, the company advised that a new contract was conditioned upon the union's withdrawing the unfair labor practice charges against the company which in the meantime had been filed and which are the basis of this proceeding before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.316" offset="1500662">Discussion sued on that point and finally on the 31st of July, the company withdrew from that position, and on August 3, a new contract was executed and the employees, the strikers were returned to their jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.869" offset="1574849">On the foregoing facts, the Board concluded that the company's position that a new contract should be executed with a firm no-strike clause for a term of one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.162" offset="1644022">In other words, insistence on its bargaining position after the union had offered to return strikers to work unconditionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.429" offset="1677040">It was in derogation of the union's bargaining position as exclusive bargaining representative that the requirement that strikers take it places that were not to go out on strike again and to cross the picket line was discriminatory under Section 8 (a) (1) and (3) of the Act, discriminatory also as to those who were working.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.368" offset="1772857">And finally, that the company's insistence during July 1952 upon a withdrawal of unfair labor practice charges then pending was a refusal to bargain in violative of the provisions of 8 (a) (5) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.799" offset="1850598">In reaching these conclusions, the Board rejected the company contention that this strike was unprotected under the Act in that the strikers lost their status of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.454" offset="1913187">The company had insisted that because these negotiations related to modification of a contract and concededly went on before the contract had expired that under a literal reading of the provisions of 8 (d) (4) of the Act, the strikers lost their status as employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.704" offset="2010154">The pertinent language of 8 (d) (4) is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.709" offset="2030216">After the proviso reference to modification or termination and the notice requirements, the sixty-day notice requirements prior to modification or termination 8 (d) (4) reads as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.973" offset="2087267">That the party who seeks changes continues in full force and effect without resorting to strike or lock-out, all the terms and conditions of the existing contract for a period of sixty days after such notice is given or until the expiration date of such contract which ever occurs later.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.058" offset="2163649">The Board said that the last three words which ever occurs later encompassed not only the termination date of a contract but covered also intermediate dates in an agreement where the parties had said in their document that they would or might seek modification</text>
            <text syncTime="534.940" offset="2243166">The court below rejected that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.349" offset="2256750">It asserted that a clear literal reading of the language of 8 (d) (4) pointed to the proposition that such a -- that a strike might be called only in the sixty-day period prior to a termination of a contract and that in effect, this statute does not permit a strike by a union in support of contract modification demands at anytime other than the final termination date of the agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="602.537" offset="2513481">It provided for a term of one year and a continuation of the agreement thereafter until canceled in the manner thereafter provided, and the manner thereafter provided was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.910" offset="2571055">First, that either party might give to the other a notification of its desire to amend the terms of this agreement, a requirement then that the parties bargain on those modification demands for sixty days.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.347" offset="2636779">A further proviso that if they did not have reached agreement within that sixty-day period that then a sixty-day termination notice might be given, in other words a second notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.636" offset="2685889">This contract really has a two sixty-day clause as contrasted with the single sixty that one finds in most agreements.</text>

            <text syncTime="1076.414" offset="4409031">In 1948, soon after the enactment of the Taft-Hartley amendments, a joint Senate labor committee on the Labor Management Relations Act was set up to study the effect of this law upon other legislation in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.024" offset="4479457">It was troubled by the identical question that's here before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.320" offset="4500668">The committee of which Senator Taft was a member in its final report on December 31, 1948 said this and it's just two sentences so I should like to read it because I think it points out the totality of the problem here and I'm quoting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.251" offset="4568377">“Reading Section 8 (d) as a whole seems to lead to the conclusion that the Act permits a strike after a sixty-day notice in the middle of a contract which authorizes a reopening on wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.856" offset="4618846">Use of the words or modify and/or modification in the proviso and use of or modification in Section 8 (d) (1), which is the notice requirement, and the statement in the final paragraph of the section that the parties are not required to agree to any modification effected before the contract maybe reopened under its terms all seem to contemplate the right of either party to insist on changes in the contract if they had so provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.227" offset="4732322">The right of the union would be an empty one without the right to strike after a sixty-day notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.986" offset="4759280">The report then went on to say that the problem was one of extreme importance to both management and labor and that clarifying language to make explicit the result it thought already contemplated by the Section would be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.835" offset="4822706">In that same day vain in 1949, Senator Taft introduced an amendment to 8 (d) which as he pointed out also, it was not designed to change the intendment of the law but because it was here that the existing language did not unambiguously expressed the intent of the Congress, it would be desirable to so provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.803" offset="4910582">That legislation passed to Senate but never did become law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.067" offset="4931688">Now, again, the legislative history, if I may characterize it as such, the total reference to 8 (d) and the precise use of modify as well as terminate in the earlier sections, suggest to us that the reading given this section by the Board is the appropriate reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.574" offset="5049657">It maybe of interest to note in passing that three members of the Board took the position that I have articulated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.652" offset="5081945">There was a dissent by a one board member and the thrust of the dissent was essentially this that the language of 8 (d) is intended to apply only to the time around the termination date of a contract and not midterm, that it was not the intent of Congress to apply it at any midterm point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1704.673" offset="6922115">It was at liberty to treat them as having severed their relations with the company because of their breach and to consummate their separation from the company's employ and hire others to take their places.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.612" offset="6981778">The Act does not prohibit an affective discharge for repudiation by the employee of his agreement anymore than it prohibits such discharge for a tort committed against an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.176" offset="7036113">Later, in the opinion, the Court stated that after the strike began, the employer has no further obligation to negotiate with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.943" offset="7083133">And it was within its rights in making a contract with a nonunion or replacement employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.881" offset="7122944">Mr. Justice Harlan, we submit that this Court had written a no-strike clause into every contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.387" offset="7156903">Now, when the Taft-Hartley amendments came before the Senate for consideration, the decision of this Court in the Sands Manufacturing Company case had the most decisive effect not only upon the negotiations in Congress but upon the form in which the amendments were finally adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.185" offset="7252093">When the amendatory bill was first passed in the House, Section 7 of the House Bill included or added to Section 7 of the old act an expressed provision to the effect that a strike in violation of contract should not be within concerted activities protected by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.809" offset="7354598">The Senate version of the bill did not include that provision in Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.933" offset="7379153">The two bills went to conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.331" offset="7388662">The conference accepted the Senate version.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.633" offset="7409873">The members of the House Conference Committee in reporting the conference bill to the House, stated or heard the House to receive from its position of insistent that Section 7 of the amended act include the provision excluding a strike against -- in violation of contract from concerted activities protected by the Act stating that it was already established, that under Section 7 of the National Labor Relation Act, a strike in violation of contract was unprotected activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.420" offset="7561070">The majority of the committee in the Senate to whom the amendatory of legislation was referred in reporting the Senate bill to the Senate made this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.029" offset="7623450">It should be noted that the Board has construed the present act as denying any remedy to employees striking for illegal objectives.</text>

            <text syncTime="1901.022" offset="7707460">The Supreme Court has interpreted the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.236" offset="7720312">It has not conferring protection upon employees who strike in breach of contract, National Labor Relations Board versus Sands Manufacturing Company, 306 U.S. 332, or in breach of some other federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.151" offset="7779976">Southern Steamship Company versus NLRB, 316 U.S. 31 or who engage in illegal acts while on strike, Fansteel Metallurgical Corporation versus NLRB, 306 U.S. 240.</text>

            <text syncTime="1954.431" offset="7921142">But we take the positions that if the conclusion which the Court reads is correct, the fact that a State has put his conclusion on an erroneous ground, would not call a reversal, the case is nevertheless -- to save the lower courts in their (Inaudible) affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.456" offset="7989164">The lower court did not discuss that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.344" offset="8000763">The lower court makes a decision solely upon the provisions of 8 (d) which we hope to be able to discuss just a little bit later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.075" offset="8035662">Other portions of the legislative history concerning the Taft-Hartley amendment are cited in our brief to the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.056" offset="8075577">Now, let us look at the record to ascertain whether this strike was in breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.733" offset="8114343">Of course it was an economic strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.751" offset="8122389">That is conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.873" offset="8130853">It is also conceded by distinguished counsel for the petitioner that the contract was in full force and effect when the strike began.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.752" offset="8174425">The contract involved, appeared at the beginning -- at page 27 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.502" offset="8205354">At page 67 of the record is shown a schedule of hourly wages to be paid to each man engage in each of the particular classifications of work therein enumerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.260" offset="8272436">The hour rates of fairs specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.873" offset="8278915">They're set out in dollars and cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.275" offset="8296469">On the next page of the record, appears a provision that in addition to the hourly wage for each hour work as provided in the exhibit of hour wages to which I have referred, each man working on the evening shift should receive an addition 7 cents an hour and each man working on the graveyard shift shall receive an addition 6 cents an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.826" offset="8418722">If we look at page 36 of the record, we find the provision of the contract which provides that each year, each employee is to be permitted six holidays with pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.461" offset="8493223">Now when this strike began, it was called by the union and was participated in by the strikers for the purpose of forcing the company immediately to increase each of those hourly wage rates by 22 cents and to increase shift differentials to 6 cents and 12 cents an hour and to grant to each man an additional holiday with pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.205" offset="8640240">We say, if the Court please, that the union in calling the strike and causing the man to refuse to work in accordance with our contract, committed a total breach of the contract and a complete repudiation of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.341" offset="8736684">That action is just exactly what this Court has held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.857" offset="8758836">Calls employer -- striking employees to lose the rights under the National Labor Relations Act when the strike is violation of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.125" offset="8791855">Now let me bear upon this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.892" offset="8806902">There was no no-strike clause in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.424" offset="8825083">There is nothing in the opinion of the Court in the Sands Manufacturing Company case to indicate that there was a no-strike clause in that contract but to the contrary, Mr. Justice Roberts in his opinion makes particular point of the fact that in that contract there was a clause which as I read the statement, he considered to be a reservation of the right to strike on the part of the union if there was disagreement between the union and the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.564" offset="8957680">This Court has stated time and time again that the purpose of the National Labor Relations Act and of the Labor Management Relations Act is to encourage industrial peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.675" offset="9014105">What could be more contrary to industrial peace than to grant relief under this Act?</text>
