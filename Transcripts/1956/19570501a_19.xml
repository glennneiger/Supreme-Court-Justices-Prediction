            <label>Mr. Fred Okrand</label>
            <text syncTime="14.922" offset="163088">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, Mr. Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.932" offset="187120">This case can and should, in my judgment, be decided without the Court having to reach the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.151" offset="236022">In any way that the Court looks at the evidence in this case, petitioner is entitled a judgment either because the lower court failed to apply proper rules of interpretation of evidence as this Court has said it should in an expatriation case or because it imposed the burden of proof upon the petitioner when the burden of proof ought to be properly imposed upon the Government in an expatriation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.578" offset="361723">The facts in this case are -- in this case are simple and there is no conflict of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.830" offset="390666">The Government introduced no evidence in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.557" offset="409579">Petitioner was born in California in 1916.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.286" offset="428492">He went to school in California and lived there all his life, graduating from Stanford University.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.687" offset="462137">On his graduation as is the case with many of our American boys, he had a chance too and did go to Japan for study and to visit.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.498" offset="505396">His expenses were being paid by his father.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.790" offset="518562">He went in 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.692" offset="534131">In California, his father and mother both lived in California and both his father and mother remained in California when he went to Japan to study and to visit.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.984" offset="583346">As luck would have it while he was in Japan in 1939, his father died.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.837" offset="602676">And he had no funds with which to return to this country and he went to work in an aircraft plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.264" offset="640397">In 1940, for -- I failed to mention and I think I -- it's important that I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.884" offset="666937">Being born in California in 1916, that is before 1924, of Japanese born parents, he was, of course, under United States law an American citizen, born an American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.957" offset="723153">And he was also under Japanese law, a Japanese citizen by virtue of that birth to Japanese born parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.096" offset="763800">So that when he went to Japan as a matter of fact in 1939, he had both nationalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.416" offset="793057">The record is not clear as to whether he knew that fact in 1939 but the fact is that he did have both nationalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.501" offset="833390">Japan, at that time, had a compulsory universal military conscription law for its nationals which provided severe criminal penalties for evasion thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.034" offset="883545">In 1940, under that conscription law, petitioner was required to take a physical examination under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.682" offset="918131">Had he not taken it, he would be subject to those criminal penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.948" offset="931192">He took the examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.259" offset="940387">And in -- that was in June of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.074" offset="955643">And in March of 1941, he was inducted under this conscription law into the Japanese Army.</text>

            <text syncTime="238.457" offset="1057207">That is on what they rely to show voluntary conduct and upon what they rely to show proof of voluntary conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.555" offset="1109556">Of course in our view, the Government has to go forward and show that it was voluntary, but I will deal with that no protest in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.531" offset="1141530">After the war, he applied at the American Consulate in -- in Japan to return to the United States and was told at that time that he was not any longer a citizen of the United States for reason of this military service under the regulations which were in effect then and are in effect now.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.681" offset="1226062">He was issued by the American Consulate a document entitled "Certificate of the Loss of the Nationality of the United States".</text>
            <text syncTime="291.017" offset="1267440">This document was executed by the vice consul and approved by the State Department here in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.437" offset="1293145">After he received that document and the denial of his passport application, he filed suit in the District Court in Los Angeles for a declaration as to whether he had lost his United States citizenship and was permitted under the law then in effect to come to California for his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.942" offset="1367124">The trial court ruled against him and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Fred Okrand</label>
            <text syncTime="394.389" offset="1680906">Which was that he was afraid to go to the American Consul at that -- at that time because of the conditions in Japan, he was under surveillance as a Nisei which is an American born Japanese person.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.618" offset="1725837">Because he feared that he would be harmed by the Kempeitai, which is the Japanese Military Police, had he done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.732" offset="1774320">The court below felt two things that the burden of proof was upon the petitioner to establish that he served involuntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.842" offset="1826774">In this, we think as a matter of law, the court below was wrong and the trial court, well, I'm not specifically saying so in this case, did follow that legal theory that the Government has pointed out that the trial court has tried a number of these cases and in other opinions that he has written, he stated that that is his view of the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.994" offset="1903365">We think that expatriation being as this Court has said, the voluntary renunciation or abandonment of nationality or allegiance, that it is incumbent upon the Government to prove its entire case, to prove expatriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.191" offset="1984136">And we think the law -- the rule is and ought to be that the Government must prove all the elements of expatriation including the element of voluntary conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.369" offset="2032828">The court below not having followed that rule on that ground alone, we believe we are entitled to a reversal of the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.025" offset="2067519">On another theory, we think that the petitioner is entitled to -- to a reversal of judgment and that is the failure of the courts below to follow what this Court has said is the rule in expatriation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.138" offset="2119973">Namely, that the facts and the law are to be interpreted so far as it's reasonable in favor of the citizen and that in the event of any ambiguity or any doubt, that must be resolved in favor of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.373" offset="2192906">I might say to the Court that this case is quite in conflict, as the Government has recognized in its response, to at least the Second and Third Circuits and also to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on both the burden of proof issue and on the feature of the case about resolving factual doubts in favor of the citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.629" offset="2301889">With reference to your question, Mr. Justice Harlan, the petitioner did not protest, did not audibly protest.He did not go to the American Consulate nor did he audibly protest to any Japanese official.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.166" offset="2387989">That feature of the case, Your Honor, is the very feature which, it is clear from a reading of the record, prompted the trial court to hold that he affirmatively acted voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.649" offset="2445981">Now, the Government has not disputed because it is the fact and has been for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.990" offset="2471372">That the Government of a country in which a person is residing particularly if he happens to be under the law of that State, a citizen or a national of that State, has the right to require the military service of that individual whether the other government wants it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.974" offset="2547231">And as we have pointed out in our brief, the Government has issued in its State Department a little -- a little booklet which it gives to persons who obtain passports.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.378" offset="2596864">It has specifically stated that it will not and it does not make any effort to relieve an American citizen, who also happens to have the nationality of a foreign state, from military obligation if he is in that state and must respond to the laws of that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.079" offset="2667708">That is not disputed by the Government and it is the fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="667.597" offset="2773765">Now, I must point out to the Court that I think this is one of the things that the trial court said he did not believe the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.646" offset="2821935">I -- I say I think it is because it isn't clear but I -- I think that's one of the things.</text>

            <text syncTime="928.176" offset="3816051">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the Third Circuit very clearly and in my judgment that the Court of Appeals for this District, for the District of Columbia has stated as a rule of evidentiary law that conscription into the army of a foreign country under compulsion of law raises a presumption of involuntary conduct, irrespective of where the burden of proof may lie to prove voluntariness or involuntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.625" offset="3921899">And those circuits have held that absent proof by the Government overcoming that presumption, a petitioner in the -- a position of -- of this petitioner here is entitled to a reversal of a trial court's judgment withheld -- which held that he served voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.259" offset="3988459">The Circuit below, the Ninth Circuit of course held to the contrary and held that there is no presumption of -- of involuntary conduct by reason of conscription.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.408" offset="4029001">That will be it under compulsion of law carrying a criminal penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.752" offset="4054392">We have suggested in our brief also one other reason why this Court need not and ought not read the -- reach the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.212" offset="4096188">We suggest that this statute ought not to be applied to this factual situation, namely, conscription under law carrying military -- carrying criminal penalties of a national resident at that time in that country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.223" offset="4176227">In answer to the Government's suggestion that then the statute would not apply to anyone, we reply that it would in fact apply to the very individuals which Congress had in mind when it passed this particular bit of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.376" offset="4236831">The legislative history of this statute is set forth at some length in the opinion of the First Circuit in the Dos Reis case which is cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.012" offset="4271417">It sets forth a great deal of the legislative history, namely, to take away citizenship from those individuals who have shown by their conduct that they want to throw off citizenship of the United States and adhere to nationality of another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.561" offset="4353651">Now, we say that -- if that is the purpose of the statute then it ought not be applied to this case because all that there is in this case is a person responding to the law of the country in which he happens to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.914" offset="4411016">One other point and I shall sit down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.791" offset="4418539">In Kawakita case which is cited in our brief and which was a treason case in which the arguments were just the other way around.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.043" offset="4451558">Petitioner was claiming loss of citizenship and the governor was saying -- the Government was saying not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.072" offset="4471620">The Government made the point that conduct requires by the law of a foreign state, in which a person was living, could not be used against him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1218.741" offset="4978291">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.707" offset="4994173">The particular facts of this case are very important because we have here of the findings of a trial judge after a trial adverse to the petitioner, affirmed by the Court of Appeals as amply supported by the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.949" offset="5055195">And so there is to a certain extent the invocation of the two-court rule relating to findings of fact upheld by two courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.780" offset="5102529">The undisputed facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.658" offset="5114023">Petitioner was born in the United States in the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.649" offset="5125935">He was educated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.790" offset="5134503">He went to the University of California and secured an engineering degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.636" offset="5153938">In August 1939, when he was 23 years of age, he went to Japan on an American passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.626" offset="5189883">His claim was that he went there to visit and study.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.186" offset="5204093">He knew Japanese apparently as an oral tongue but he did not -- he could not write Japanese or read Japanese because when he got to Japan, he hired a tutor to teach him Japanese characters so that he could read and write Japanese.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.227" offset="5268250">His father died shortly after he got to Japan in November 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.513" offset="5289462">He did not then return to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.844" offset="5298761">His claim at the trial was that he did not have funds to come back to the United States though his father had given him the funds to go to Japan and he did testify that his father was going to support him during his studies in Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.108" offset="5363754">It -- he knew when he went to Japan in 1939 -- in August 1939 that he was national of Japan as well as the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.877" offset="5406908">He was a dual national and he also knew that Japan was fighting in Manchuria, that there were hostilities going on at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.411" offset="5445047">When his father died and he felt he couldn't continue with his studies as he said, he then went to work in an airplane plant in Japan and this was apparently shortly after his father died in November 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.692" offset="5498128">In June 1940, he was notified that he would be inducted into the Japanese Army and he came and took a physical examination in June 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.407" offset="5540968">He was not actually inducted until nine months later, March 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.366" offset="5564792">Now, during that period of nine months between June 1940 and March 1941, he himself testified that he did not make any protest or any inquiries, letter on protest, any protest or any inquiries of either to the Japanese authorities or of the American authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.792" offset="5638562">That is the American Consulate or the American Embassy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.544" offset="5653504">He did nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.523" offset="5657475">He did not attempt to renounce his Japanese nationality as some other persons and I think I can say this because it -- it came up in the record of the Kawakita case to which Mr. Okrand mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.934" offset="5707107">There were a Japanese dual national to renounce their Japanese nationality abroad in order not to serve in the Japanese Army, nor did he seek to come back to this country in anyway.</text>
