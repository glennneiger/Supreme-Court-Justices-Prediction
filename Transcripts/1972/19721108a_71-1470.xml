            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We’ll hear arguments next in 71-1470, Lemon against Kurtzman.</text>

            <label>Mr. David P. Bruton</label>
            <text syncTime="49.145" offset="299969">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.670" offset="318046">This litigation is now before this tribunal for the second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.436" offset="341138">On the first occasion, this Court ruled in Lemon versus Kurtzman that Pennsylvania Act 109 providing aid to nonpublic schools was unconstitutional on its face under the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.403" offset="408952">The case has returned here again because there is a dispute as to the affect and purpose of that prior ruling, and the question which is now presented is whether the Commonwealth can now disperse an additional $24 million approximately, under the statute which has been held unconstitutional to Pennsylvania’s sectarian schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.976" offset="511248">The relevant facts I think are these, and they fall into two categories, first with respect to Pennsylvania Act 109 itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.255" offset="544371">That statute provided a scheme for subsidy to the nonpublic schools in the form of reimbursement for certain so called “secular education services” as defined in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.456" offset="597243">And the expenses which could be reimbursed under the statute included the cost of teacher salaries, textbooks, and instructional materials for certain specified types of courses of instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.877" offset="650846">And the areas of instruction which were included were mathematics, modern foreign languages, physical sciences and physical education.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.226" offset="692328">The schools became eligible for reimbursement under this statute by entering into in the scheme of the statute certain agreements, purchase of service contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.788" offset="734542">And under these agreements they were to be paid by the State in the subsequent school year for these so called services which were rendered during the prior year.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.361" offset="780831">Now, it was not of course necessary for any school to show that it had in fact added any new teachers, admitted any new pupils, hired any new textbooks or otherwise really incurred any new expenses in order to receive aid under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.470" offset="849272">All it was required that it was the school satisfied the State that the expenditures in question fell within the defined statutory categories and, this is a very vital “and” I think, that the services for which reimbursement was sought were in fact secular, and did not include any subject matter expressing religious teaching or the morals, or beliefs of any particular sect.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.770" offset="962435">The Commonwealth was given extensive administrative powers in carrying out the purpose of this statute with the right to audit the performance of each school and its books and records to make sure that the expenditures were properly made.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.434" offset="1017083">This then, in brief summary, is the scheme of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.615" offset="1029831">I’d like to turn now to the chronology of events here, which I think is quite significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.964" offset="1055222">The statute was passed in June of 1968, and within one month the plaintiffs announced publicly and this was in the news media, that they intended to challenge the constitutionality of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.663" offset="1109974">Of course, the suit itself could not be brought until it was clear that the statute was operational that in fact funds were going to be disbursed under it, otherwise there was a possibility that the claim could be dismissed as premature.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.083" offset="1159711">And it was not until six months later, at the end of 1968 that the State issued rules and regulations and forms and so forth which could be submitted by schools seeking subsidy under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.479" offset="1213315">Now, these so called agreements were to be submitted by January 15th of 1969 with schedules identifying the classes, the number of pupils and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.744" offset="1254379">And then in June, at the end of the school year, additional schedules were to be submitted which detail the precise items of expenditure that they were seeking reimbursement for.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.126" offset="1303907">Once it was clear that the statute was indeed operational, plaintiffs filed suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.093" offset="1323760">Now, this was in July of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.985" offset="1335359">At that time the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.718" offset="1354271">And I may say to the considerable surprise of the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.144" offset="1371930">The District Court panel in a 2-1 decision over the dissent of Chief Justice -- Chief Judge Hastie granted that motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.727" offset="1410278">Plaintiffs immediately appealed to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.032" offset="1427519">Within six weeks, after the decision of the District Court, the schools again entered into these contracts which are annual in nature on the 15th of January 1970, and it’s at this point, Your Honors, I would like to correct a factual error which is in the record and it has been in the record I’m afraid from the time this case was presented to the District Court on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.761" offset="1526366">And I think that Mr. Ball and I are in agreement that we can now stipulate to this change.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.011" offset="1547368">And the change is this, it was stated below by the defendants that on January 15, 1970 the schools entered into contracts for services to be rendered in the subsequent school year 1970 to 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.047" offset="1607555">We have repeated that statement in the briefs that we have filed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.285" offset="1620511">That is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.935" offset="1627094">The contracts that were signed on the 15th of January 1970 were applicable to services provided in that school year that was already half over 1969-1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.809" offset="1670562">And it was therefore not until a year later, January 15, 1971 that agreements were entered into by the schools covering services for the 1970-1971 school year.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.057" offset="1715597">There is a one year difference there, and although I frankly don’t believe that it’s critical to the plaintiffs’ case here, I think it does have a good deal to do with the arguments of the defendants have made as I come to in a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.389" offset="1764916">The facts that these agreements were not signed until the 15th of January 1971, means that a number of other intervening events have occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="668.786" offset="2778467">And the difference is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.813" offset="2790588">This Court, I think, focused principally in its decision which came down in June of 1971, holding that Act 109 was unconstitutional on its face, on the question of entanglement.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.352" offset="2848789">I think there are other threads that can be discerned in the fabric of the opinions of the Court, but I think this is we’ll assume for the moment the primary one.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.212" offset="2880240">And as to entanglement, it is the position of the defendants here that all the entanglement that there might be under this statute has already occurred with respect to 1970-1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.179" offset="2924126">In effect, the horse has been stolen, there’s no point in locking the barn now.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.692" offset="2942098">This contention, the plaintiffs disagree with vigorously.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.445" offset="2961115">We say that there is no indication in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.870" offset="2974804">In fact, there is evidence to the contrary that there has been the kind of discriminating meaningful inquiry by the Commonwealth into the applications which have been submitted by over a thousand schools, most of them sectarian, to insure that these funds would not be used in fact for the furtherance of religious purposes in violation of the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.263" offset="3084413">And not only is there no evidence in the record whatsoever to support the position of the defendants on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.460" offset="3113253">They asked simply that you conclusively presume that all this has been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.540" offset="3129553">I think there is now evidence, and we’ve referred to it in our supplemental brief filed only last week that indicates to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.899" offset="3159019">In fact, the Commonwealth has advised one of the named defendant schools in this very litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.879" offset="3186918">The Montgomery -- Philadelphia Montgomery Christian Academy and certain other schools that they are not eligible for any aid under Act 109, whatever remaining aid there may be under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.190" offset="3236133">Because in the by-laws or a charter of the Institution, there is reference made to the fact that the God’s creation has a bearing on the teaching practices of that Institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.786" offset="3294542">And I think my witty opponent Mr. Ball, would be the first one to concede that the application of that kind of administrative standard in making these determinations if applied to all of the schools in the State would disqualify every Catholic parochial school in the State of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.283" offset="3356505">I don’t think there’s any question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.854" offset="3370820">The Montgomery Academy confronted with this decision brought suit against the Commonwealth in the federal District Court seeking to have a reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.804" offset="3406555">They were told not surprisingly at that point, this occurring after the decision of this Court striking down Act 109, they were told that they could not have a hearing to review the administrative determination made by the State because that would create the very entanglement which this Court has said is forbidden by the Religion Clauses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1160.451" offset="4745174">I suggest that the record doesn’t really indicate that that’s the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.701" offset="4762206">It’s not the parochial schools who didn’t open this fall for lack of funds in Philadelphia.</text>

            <text syncTime="1177.005" offset="4811421">But in that ultimate sense if that were ultimately shown to be the case, I guess it could be said yes, there is a quid pro quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.399" offset="4836916">I suggest it need not be assumed to be true at this point, and in respect of the particular years involved, I think it’s clear that the schools would have incurred these expenses anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.828" offset="4886653">Secondly, you have a fact that the Commonwealth itself has regarded this statutory scheme as essentially a subsidy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.502" offset="4925419">Again, I point to the case referred to in our supplemental brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.839" offset="4942764">The Philadelphia Montgomery Christian Academy was told by the Commonwealth in July of 1970 that it would receive no payments in respect of services provided during the preceding school year, 1969-1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.885" offset="5010892">And interestingly enough the District Court never faced that question when it dismissed the Academy’s complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.408" offset="5033044">The Commonwealth didn’t talk about contractual reliance there, equitable obligations, contractual obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.455" offset="5057181">They treated it as a subsidy which could and should be cut off at any time the State decided that it was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.510" offset="5085393">And this is precisely the position that we’re taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.631" offset="5093857">I think the actions of the Commonwealth confirm it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.602" offset="5105768">Third, the fact is that because the contracts were not entered into for the year in question until January 15, 1971, the schools had already incurred whatever expenses there were in teaching the subjects they were halfway through the school year, and the single most important sentence I think in the opinion of the court below which justified the decision below is this, and I’m quoting from our jurisdictional statement page 9 of the appendix.</text>

            <text syncTime="1545.778" offset="6286503">And I only want to distinguish what this Court did in Allen from what this Court did in this case in Lemon versus Kurtzman, where it specifically declined to assume on a basis of a bare bones record that there could be no entanglement here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.950" offset="6355153">Allen was dealing with textbooks.</text>

            <text syncTime="1588.207" offset="6456195">Plus the fact that I say the record does have positive evidence indicating that the State is not doing what it would have to do really to take care of its constitutional obligations here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1658.675" offset="6738108">We’re only talking about the future payments and here we’re again on this question of reliance, and as I say, I don’t think that there could be any genuine element of surprise here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.810" offset="6786591">I think it’s perhaps interesting in connection with the question you raised, to look at the one case in this Court that I have found which lies in this stream of municipal bond cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.302" offset="6836537">Norton versus Shelby County, it’s cited in both of the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.807" offset="6850644">It may even be referred to in the opinion below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.161" offset="6860048">Now, what that case is usually cited for is some rather black stony in language about the absolute retroactivity of judicial decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.783" offset="6894529">But what I’d like to call attention to is the facts of that case. Contrary to the other bond cases, in that case you had a statute passed which purported to transfer certain taxing powers from one political body to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.728" offset="6954297">The statute was challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.601" offset="6961821">The lower court ruled in favor of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.463" offset="6973210">In the time intervening between the trial and the appeal, bonds were issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.070" offset="6995675">On the appeal, the lower court was reversed, and in that case this Court concluded that the bonds were invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.528" offset="7021484">That goes farther than what we have to do here, but I think it’s the only case in that line of cases where you find that sequence of events.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.014" offset="7051473">Elsewhere, the case always was that there had been consistent judicial interpretations upholding a statute by the highest court of the jurisdiction involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.992" offset="7087313">Subsequent to the issuance of bonds, there is a reversal of that precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.870" offset="7102882">I think that’s a very different case and certainly not one that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.797" offset="7114585">We’re much closer to Norton versus Shelby County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.167" offset="7132035">When you’re done, I think, looking at this reliance question and really looking at it not just taking it on its face, I think the record indicates that there are no genuinely persuasive reasons for departing from the precedence of this Court in the area of perspective and retrospective application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.167" offset="7220015">Indeed as I say again, in a literal sense a prospective application of the ruling in Lemon versus Kurtzman will give the plaintiffs the result that they are asking for.</text>

            <text syncTime="1992.126" offset="8071920">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.589" offset="8089684">I’m arguing here today not only on behalf of the defendant schools who are named in the complaint, Lemon versus Kurtzman, but also on behalf of the Commonwealth who is represented here today by the Attorney General who sits next to me at counsel table.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.467" offset="8149243">And on behalf of the intervenor defendant of Pennsylvania Association of Independent Schools, whose counsel a distinguished Philadelphia -- a member of the Philadelphia bar Mr. Henry T. Reath is here, and who has presented a brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.354" offset="8220818">The appellants agree with the Commonwealth, with the schools, with the intervenor defendant and with the court below that a decree of unconstitutionality does not necessarily have, in all cases, a retrospective effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.217" offset="8328234">Rather, the answer to whether it does or does not would depend in part upon considerations of the interests of justice and it will depend also upon whether the constitutional policy which was expressed in the decree will be frustrated if the application is made only prospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.420" offset="8425096">The appellants on the first point have said there was really no interest of justice involved, so far as the schools are concerned, and they have said secondly, that the very crisis of which the Court attract in Lemon versus Kurtzman will be perpetuated should the Court hold and agree with the unanimous court below that this statute should be, that its decree should be applied only prospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.367" offset="8564799">And as these two points namely, the question of the interest of justice, the question of the constitutional policy that I will address myself to in this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.838" offset="8614745">Now, we speak of the interest of justice, I think Your Honors that we have to focus first of all on the holders of that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.642" offset="8637942">And in this case, they are school people, they are educators, they are people who are working with parents and with children in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.732" offset="8682350">In the real life business of being locked in a struggle against inflation and taxation in educating 23% of the population of the Commonwealth of the school population of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, some 535,000 children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.097" offset="8759777">Children who are being educated in schools in the inner city of Philadelphia, in the large population centers of Pittsburgh and Scranton, and Erie, and who are also found in the coal regions and the rural regions of that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.226" offset="8820276">As we look at these holders of this interest then we have to ask ourselves whether they were in good faith, whether they were justified and reasonably relying upon the continuing validity of this Act which was passed by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.980" offset="8883284">Whether indeed there were actual real legal contracts which they had entered upon, and whether they are going to suffer hardship if the 1970-1971 claimants which they have earned are not to denied them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.778" offset="8946500">I too feel that the chronology of events becomes important in understanding this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.268" offset="8976488">As counsel has stated, the Act was passed in June of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.180" offset="8996133">Immediately thereafter, the Commonwealth Department of Education tooled up to put the Act into full operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.805" offset="9034585">That began to occur immediately upon the passage of the Act, and by the fall, time of the opening of the school year an office to administer this Act had been set up and paid employees of that office appointed, and their work had begun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.587" offset="9105742">Indeed, counsel speaks of the regulations which counsel’s briefs tells us appeared in December of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.767" offset="9146389">These were created in the fall of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.081" offset="9159659">Thus, the fact that a challenge to this Act had been announced in the press immediately upon the passage of the Act, but no suit brought certainly gave the administrators of the schools reasonable reliance, at least a measure of it that the Act was going to remain unchallenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.238" offset="9256312">The plaintiffs had every opportunity to bring an injunction action that very fall because money was committed to the program and that program was in on operation at this time, they neglected to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="2371.793" offset="9590575">Now then, contracts were entered into January 15, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.873" offset="9610846">Why the delay if this was a true contractual situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.319" offset="9632684">In this governmental program as in many similar programs, say if the federal government, sometimes legislation is passed putting a program into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.675" offset="9666121">Then the people who are going to participate in the program enter into application relationships in anticipation of entering contracts under the program, and they then go ahead and execute the contract at some later date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.129" offset="9719933">And this is how that January 15 date gets locked in to the annual renewal of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.435" offset="9761102">1181 schools entered into contracts with the Commonwealth, and I should like to pause here briefly to cover a point that I don’t think is essential for our case, though I think it does add to the interest of justice the equity aspect of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2585.788" offset="10446555">Furthermore, they had to conform their teaching plans to the severe secularity requirements of the Act, so that in the teaching of these four subjects, those requirements would be observed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.839" offset="10502771">They also had to setup separate accounting systems according to one provision of the Act, whereby they had to keep separate accounts related to these four subjects.</text>

            <text syncTime="2672.680" offset="10794088">That is to say the State enters into a contract with let us say a sectarian child caring institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.794" offset="10826585">It does so, and this brings us back to a question asked by Mr. Chief Justice Burger this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.321" offset="10848632">It does so because it has a public need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.763" offset="10858454">The State has a need for that service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.635" offset="10869948">It needs to have someone take care let’s say of dependent and neglected children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.006" offset="10891368">So it goes to a sectarian institution, child caring institution, and pays it to carry on this publicly needed service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.421" offset="10929089">The institution itself does nothing more than it did before, but it is now aided materially in the rendering of that service, and indeed it may improve the services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.736" offset="10970363">We happen to know that in Pennsylvania, what this Act meant was that a school which had a class let’s say of 70 children in a math class could now split that into two or three sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.629" offset="11017906">A school which had not been able to afford to have a calculus course could now hire a calculus teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.327" offset="11044655">A school which had not previously had a course in Spanish could now institute a course in Spanish.</text>

            <text syncTime="2983.786" offset="12038562">We did not think that the provisions with respect to secularity, with respect to church school or state school relationships contained in Act 109 added a feathers weight to the kind of relationship which was already considered licit in the law and which had been recognized by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.786" offset="12150471">The school administrators both sectarian and nonsectarian had no complaint with respect to the administration of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.089" offset="12179728">Conceivably there would be sense to it, and again we saw no degree of relationship such as is observed in purchase of service arrangements in the welfare and healthcare fields.</text>

            <text syncTime="3361.200" offset="13548126">Secondly, instructional materials and textbooks allocated again to the four subjects.</text>

            <text syncTime="3370.781" offset="13586474">Now, as to the textbooks and instructional materials, looking at it now from the point of view in entanglement, the Act required that these be previously approved prior to use, prior to use in the classroom, prior to any reimbursement of these books, previously approved and the regulations spell that after.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.202" offset="13664214">The regulations say that a list of textbooks used by participating nonpublic schools and programs for which payment is sought onto the Act shall be submitted the Superintendent of Public Instruction by the nonpublic schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.397" offset="13713011">Thereafter, the Superintendent shall review each list and will notify the nonpublic school of his approval in whole or in part of a list of textbooks being guided by the requirements of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3440.394" offset="13864939">Secondly as to teachers’ salaries, the classes involved took place years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.164" offset="13900048">So that if it were asked was the worthy secularity requirements of the act observed in the teaching of the four subjects, one would have to say that the Commonwealth did perform that function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.462" offset="13965249">That this case which Mr. Bruton cites is strong evidence of this fact, but more important than that is the fact that there is a clearly established presumption in the law of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.114" offset="14027839">I cite the case of Falkenburg versus Venango Township 297 Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.207" offset="14052185">There was always a presumption that official acts or duties have been properly performed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3885.222" offset="15644296">In other words, let us what takes place in the post audit is simply a review of the audit of the State Treasurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3891.910" offset="15671045">In other words, the checks which have been paid out are examined, examined against the allocation of time if the teacher is paid $15.00 an hour let us suppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.219" offset="15724231">And the record shows that she put in 60 hours is the amount is to be paid, or was paid, or is listed by certified by the State Treasurer that she is to be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3920.481" offset="15785253">Does that equal 15 times 60?</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.889" offset="15794970">That’s what that the audit amounts in those sense Mr. Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.966" offset="15819212">Is it an examination of the whole curriculum or life of the school?</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.919" offset="15835094">In no sense, does it involve classroom surveillance?</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.165" offset="15848051">I therefore conclude by urging the Court to affirm the judgment below as clear as it was, and I hope it is clear to the Court that the interest of justice are thereby served, and secondly that no entanglements for the future are possible under the decree of the court below.</text>

            <text syncTime="3956.142" offset="15927986">Mr. Ball, will you take just a minute and try to get me clear on the point that Mr. Bruton was making as I understood in that there was a mistake in the record as to the date the contracts were entered into?</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.706" offset="15982216">I think he said they were entered into January 15, 1971 for the school year 1970-1971, and therefore they could’ve been no reliance on the contracts since the school year was half over.</text>

            <label>Mr. William B. Ball</label>
            <text syncTime="3986.529" offset="16049507">My response to that is that the problem of contracting had been established in the 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.936" offset="16079078">There was a period between the enactment of Act 109 and the getting it into operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.770" offset="16118471">During which, the school year 1968-1969 began.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.872" offset="16138846">Therefore, what was sought were applications from any schools that were interested in participating in the program and they began to flow in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.217" offset="16172283">Everyone had read the terms of the Act and knew that they would be under contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.895" offset="16190986">The nature of the contract could certainly be defined through a reading of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4027.901" offset="16215019">And therefore, in the initial year tooling up, there was a small lag between the beginning of September and January 15 for the issuing of those first contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.943" offset="16259114">Then a program is instituted which will obviously an annually repeated program.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.225" offset="16284296">And each year therefore, this date of January 15th was carried forward so that there could be complete reliance not merely on the contract but more basically upon the ongoing continuation of the program.</text>
