            <text syncTime="44.128" offset="279907">This cause is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit to reveal a -- to review a judgment of that court reversing an order of the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, dismissing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.409" offset="376978">The facts in issue are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.975" offset="395264">The petitioner in the writ of habeas corpus in the District Court, Donald Somerville, was indicted by an Illinois grand jury for the offense of felonious theft.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.726" offset="458271">A jury was selected and sworn to try the issues of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.771" offset="490454">The day afterwards, before any evidence was heard and before any opening arguments were made by counsel, the counsel for the State of Illinois moved the court to dismiss the indictment on the basis that it failed to charge a crime cognizable by the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.251" offset="576345">That is, it failed to avert a necessary element of the offense of felonious theft, and that is the intent to permanently deprive.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.378" offset="620857">Over a general objection of defense counsel, the court sustained State's motion and dismissed the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.439" offset="665161">Two days later, the matter resubmitted to an Illinois grand jury, and a second indictment was returned, charging the very same offense, this time alleging the necessary averments to constitute an offense in Illinois law.</text>

            <text syncTime="159.769" offset="742484">Suppose the day before the trial, a motion had been made by defense counsel, challenging the indictment on the same grounds, and if the court had dismissed the indictment as defective, what would have been the status under Illinois law of that case, could they have gone to the grand jury again, got a new indictment?</text>

            <text syncTime="266.212" offset="1168175">However, if there is some defect in the jurisdiction of the court before which the matter is presented, under the classical rule of double jeopardy, he is not then in legal jeopardy as the concept was understood initially, and has been understood to my way of thinking since the inception of the rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.016" offset="1423444">Our basis being that, in reference -- in deference to Illinois state criminal procedure, the question of judicial power to try criminal cases, the Court, before whom Donald Somerville, was arraigned for trial, had been it theft under Illinois law, no power to trying for that offense, and --</text>

            <text syncTime="388.543" offset="1657501">And that would depend on whether or not the defendant has sustained any substantial burden as a result of the error, if it is an error, on the part of the prosecutor in drafting a defective indictment and proceeding trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.167" offset="1720090">And that would depend again upon the course that the trial took up to the time of the mistrial.</text>

            <text syncTime="855.081" offset="3523688">And I say this, that the only purpose in jurisdiction is to restrict the exercise of the judicial power of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.102" offset="3563813">It's for -- it's for the advantage of the defendant, so to speak, so that the Court cannot try any criminal case except those that are allowed by the particular state constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.462" offset="3637269">Now, if it should proceed to do so, even though its ultra vires or the court has no jurisdiction to do it, the one -- the ultimate issue in any legal proceeding is to determine the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.388" offset="3704874">And if the merits of the case are determined by a court even though it did not have jurisdiction, then we're put in this position, a jury or a trier of fact has resolved the issues against the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.183" offset="3768090">Now, albeit, the Court perhaps did not have jurisdictionm the state was not prejudiced by that and there is no reason to suspect that had the court had jurisdiction, there would have been a difference in the outcome of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.096" offset="3839770">And therefore, since the matter was determined on the merits, then why allow the state to avert that result simply by claiming lack of jurisdiction.</text>

Ledford versus Brantley was a case for pointing to charge the defendant with burglary and under Illinois law to pass to the offense of burglary you have to show ownership of the property burgled in someone other than the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.638" offset="6477928">In that case they fail to allege the ownership of burglarized premises and the inmate in that case, Ledford, after pleading guilty to the indictment, he pleaded guilty which normally waives all defects other than jurisdictional defects, pleaded guilty and subsequently filed a petition for habeas corpus under the State Habeas Corpus Act and the court held in that case, that his plea of guilty did not wave the jurisdictional defect and therefore it was subject to an attack in a post-conviction proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1967.798" offset="7974536">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.791" offset="7986552">As Justice Harlan stated in his opinion in the Jorn case, the purpose of the double jeopardy provision is a constitutional policy of finality for the defendant's benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.429" offset="8041096">Here, that policy was violated, where the defendant was put to trial once on a invalid indictment and then re-indicted and put to trial again on the subsequent valid indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.875" offset="8090833">We have in the history of the decisions of this Court a two constellations of cases if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.469" offset="8121240">We have the Perez case and the cases along the line of following Perez under different circumstances where this Court is held that the trial maybe aborted by the trial judge without the consent of the defendant, where there is a manifest necessity for doing so, where there is a breakdown in the judicial machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.733" offset="8218311">Those are the words used by the Court. On the other hand, we have another constellation of cases, the Downum case, the Jorn case, the Green case, I think belongs in that category, where the Court has held that the trial cannot be aborted without the defendant having him placed in jeopardy and I hasten to add that sometimes jeopardy is a conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.830" offset="8310680">Suffice it to say that the trial, that the defendant cannot be retried after the first trial was aborted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.547" offset="8341608">To get to the question now before the court, the issue is whether or not the fact that they -- the existence here of a defective indictment takes this case out of the classic mold, which the general rule applies, to which the general rule applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.846" offset="8418722">The respondent submits that it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.163" offset="8436067">I would like to look at some of the circumstances here, which this Court has considered in reaching the conclusion that re-prosecution would be barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.889" offset="8474937">Admittedly now, these circumstances are not a -- are not each in and of themselves determinant, but they all go into the double jeopardy equation and one of the first circumstances we have here is that neither the mistrial nor the defective indictment was caused by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.849" offset="8550797">I would call your attention to the Tateo case where the Court found that the mistrial was caused by the defendant, the guilty plea in that instance, not a mistrial, and the defendant also subsequently, by a 2255 proceeding attacked the judgment of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.364" offset="8612864">Similarly, in the Ewell case, there was interestingly a bad indictment and there the defendant subsequently, by 2255 proceeding or at least on appeal, attacked the judgment of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.649" offset="8673991">Now, this Court held that there was either a continuing jeopardy as expressed in Price versus Georgia, or the defendant had waived his jeopardy, whichever theory is adopted under these facts, the defendant can be retried on a subsequent valid indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.178" offset="8752044">Now interestingly, in the Ewell case, there was a bad indictment, but this Court chose not to rest its opinion on the existence of a bad indictment for the proposition urged by the state here that there was no jurisdiction and therefore, jeopardy had not attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.886" offset="8822888">This Court relied rather on the sounder proposition that once the defendant attacks the judgment of conviction, his jeopardy has not somehow concluded, and there is a continuing jeopardy if you will.</text>

            <text syncTime="2246.804" offset="9090591">Importantly, however, it was caused by the prosecution and that distinguishes this case even from the Jorn case, where the mistrial was occasioned by the conduct of the trial judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2270.014" offset="9183378">This -- well, I would pass again to the third point, what I call the official cause of the mistrial was the motion for the mistrial made by the prosecution in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.896" offset="9226951">Again, I call your attention to the Jorn case, where in dissenting, three justices noted that the -- I'm quoting "the mistrial was not requested by the prosecution", this cannot be said about this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.744" offset="9298317">The citation for the Ewell case is 383 US 116, 1966 case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2317.045" offset="9371564">I would like to call your attention to the concept of overreaching expressed by Justice Harlan in the Jorn case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2331.834" offset="9430706">It can be as Justice Frankfurter indicated in the concurring opinion in Brock versus North Carolina, it can be incompetent or a casual or ineffective conduct of a prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.013" offset="9487444">I would also point out that it can be passive as well as active here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.705" offset="9502177">In the Downum case, we have what might be termed passive overreaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.288" offset="9520567">The prosecutor didn't have the witnesses there to testify against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.748" offset="9546376">Here, apparently, it resulted from the drafting of a bad indictment and the indictments are drafted by the State's Attorney's office, but more importantly here, the state was actually given a second chance to correct this error before a jury was empaneled and sworn and that's when the case went to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.630" offset="9633938">And we suggest here that the error would not have been held so serious if the prosecution had not proceeded to trial on this bad indictment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2436.563" offset="9849605">Had there been no jurisdiction there, that I think the court would have to hold that the acquittal itself was invalid, the acquittal could not have suddenly caused jeopardy to exist where there was no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.661" offset="9918046">I point out the purposes of an indictment here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.970" offset="9927241">There are two -- at least two purposes of the indictment are to enable the accused to prepare a defense and of course, to plead for jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.209" offset="9956185">Here, there is no indication that the accused had not been able to prepare a defense and was, in fact, ready to go to trial and this is indicated also by his objection to the declaration of a mistrial, which I would point out, does not appear to be a token objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.038" offset="10015535">We don't have the record of the state court proceedings, but I would quarrel with the state's characterization of this objection as a token objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.893" offset="10114905">Also supporting the argument here, of course, is the decision in Benton versus Maryland, where the court noted that the defendant there, as here, had not been -- at the first trial had not been terminated, the defendant could well have served out his time under this invalid indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.797" offset="10186585">This, I think, is a very important practical point, which also goes to the jurisdiction of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.784" offset="10214484">You see the defendant could have served time even in a case where the state would argue that the court had no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.222" offset="10248234">A decision in line with what the state urges here would not take into account the practicalities present in a situation like this.</text>

            <text syncTime="2575.916" offset="10407058">Now the state argues that once it comes to his attention, this somehow deprives the judge of a power to continue the trial when in the first instance, the judge didn't have any power to continue the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.720" offset="10470275">I don't think this argument again comports with the reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.393" offset="10500995">The mere fact of knowledge should not be controlling in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.179" offset="10516041">Here, the defendant admittedly with knowledge or notice, if you will, after this defect was called to his attention, wanted to continue with the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2629.952" offset="10623143">In this case, we are here today, I think Your Honors would hasten to point out to me that this mistrial had been declared under the defendant's motion and that's the principle of the Ewell case and the Tateo case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.662" offset="10681971">We can't take inconsistent positions and then ask for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.077" offset="10707675">As the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stated in the Holden case, which was cited in the state's brief, you can't blow hot and cold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.048" offset="10739545">Now that was a double jeopardy case, where the defendant wanted to blow hot and cold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.899" offset="10755009">He objected to an invalid indictment, then he interposed the defense of double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.764" offset="10778415">The respondent in this case was consistent throughout the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.604" offset="10793775">He objected to termination of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.748" offset="10810389">He maintained in the Appellate Court of Illinois that the indictment was, in fact, valid and I think obviously, he was adequately placed upon notice and he could prepare a defense and that's one of the essential purposes of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.347" offset="10892727">Another point, which I think should be taken into consideration here and I will make it only briefly is the potentiality for abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.143" offset="10915924">We do not argue that in this case, there was an abuse by the prosecutor's office of an invalid indictment, but the potentiality is there, especially in this situation, unlike the situation in United States versus Jorn, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.786" offset="10978513">I call Your Honors' attention to the quotation from People versus Barrett (ph) in the Downum case, which I think quite adequately covers that particular issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2730.452" offset="11025220">Mr. Alwin, doesn't the Illinois law will carry some safeguards against this type of abuse, if under an invalid indictment, the defendant can, not only get his conviction reversed on appeal also his state doesn't bring it up with the trial, but actually get collaterally released after judgments become final?</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.989" offset="11103378">There certainly isn't much incentive for the state to put in deliberately a defect in the indictment thinking if the trail goes badly, we will use it, if not, we will forget about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2795.335" offset="11284668">I think in the experience of lawyers, frequently a prosecutor will go to a jury with a case, which due not necessarily to a bad indictment, but due to very strong error, he may suspect, will be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2814.939" offset="11363140">When you are talking about whether some will be reversed or not, that always ends up as the judgment of the appellate court as to whether the thing was not only erroneous but also prejudicial, but here you presumably, you start the trial with the opening day, with an indictment that is demonstrably bad and will entitle this man to be released from any judgment of conviction without anybody's assessment of prejudicial error or the like.</text>

            <text syncTime="2971.247" offset="11988407">To answer there would be a waste of time is shortsighted for this overlooks the valued right of the defendant to go to this jury and by this confrontation to end the confrontation, rather with the state at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.970" offset="12071267">I would finally point out that if Your Honors have doubt about whether or not the defendant's plea of double jeopardy should be sustained as Your Honors pointed out in Downum, this doubt should be resolved in favor of the citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.114" offset="12151829">In the final analysis, as Justice Harlan stated enjoined with the judges' decision in the -- the trial judges' decision to abort the trials to be tempered with the defendant's right to go to this jury, which has been selected and sworn and to end this confrontation with the state right at that point.</text>
