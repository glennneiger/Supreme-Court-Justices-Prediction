            <text syncTime="31.001" offset="227349">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.919" offset="239052">On February the 1st, 1971 the District of Columbia Court Reorganization Act became effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.028" offset="267473">Among other things that act created the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, a court and its judges hold office for limited terms and vested jurisdiction in that court to hear and determine certain felony charges brought by the United States of America against persons accused violating acts of congress applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.397" offset="356916">The courts below and the parties have tended to call such acts, local statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.243" offset="376351">On February 23rd of 1971, appellant was indicted in the Superior Court for violation of such a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.082" offset="411669">The crime of carrying a dangerous weapon, in this case, a gun without a permit having been issued in accordance with law.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.795" offset="442598">Since appellant had previously been convicted of another and an unrelated felony and that prior conviction is not an issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.486" offset="473318">The charge against him was a felony charge, if convicted he stood do face imprisonment for up to ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.600" offset="501739">Prior to trial appellant challenged the jurisdiction of the Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.590" offset="521697">He claimed that he was entitled to have his case heard and determined by a constitutional court that is of course, a court was then been established in accordance with Article III and presided over by a judge holding office during good behavior.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="118.352" offset="576763">And his claim was based upon the fact that this was a felony charge?</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="124.514" offset="601422">In other words, he at least implicitly conceded that he could have been charged honest to mere charge?</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank F. Flegal</label>
            <text syncTime="130.658" offset="625977">Yes, indeed so sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.110" offset="631829">We make a distinction here and let me just briefly elude to it now and then when we get to the argument address it in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.485" offset="657324">Historically, as this court is dealt with in the Article III jury trial cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.424" offset="673102">There has been a distinction between minor or petty cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.022" offset="687417">Historically, as this court pointed out in the Clawans case, 300 United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.408" offset="704972">English judges prior to the adoption of the constitution, judges not of the general jurisdiction of England, held and heard and determine minor matters involving up to one year imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.214" offset="752201">Congress has always assumed that to be the case in the District of Columbia and indeed nor has magistrates in the several states, non Article III officers hearing such minor matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.629" offset="793893">For purposes of our argument we assume that there is a class of matter and we assume although this court has never decided that a misdemeanor and one year is the appropriate constitutional judgement.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.746" offset="838405">There is a historical basis for that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="185.246" stopTime="189.953">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="185.246" offset="844361">There maybe a difference between a “petty offense” and misdemeanor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_f_flegal" startTime="189.953" stopTime="190.549">

            <text syncTime="189.953" offset="863169">Indeed there maybe --</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="190.549" offset="865573">Any event, you say that maybe that whatever the--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_f_flegal" startTime="193.424" stopTime="436.860">
            <label>Mr. Frank F. Flegal</label>
            <text syncTime="193.424" offset="877066">In any event whatever the law and event, a felony is our proposition in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.291" offset="896502">After that motion was overruled, the trial court proceeded to consider appellants motion to suppress evidence which was based upon appellants Fourth Amendment contention that the method by which police officers obtained the evidence in this case, the gun, was a result of an unreasonable seizure of appellants purse.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.046" offset="975600">The court heard evidence and I put aside for the moment the details of that evidence so that it would be freshly at hand when returned to the Fourth Amendment argument, Fourth Amendment position later in the argument and having heard that evidence overruled appellant's objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.571" offset="1029622">Appellant elected to stand on the legal issue which had been raised and trial by jury having been waived, the trial court found appellant guilty of the charge against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.296" offset="1064521">He was subsequently sentenced to from 2-6 years in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.735" offset="1078314">Execution of the sentence was suspended except for 180 days imprisonment on condition of six years probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.113" offset="1107780">An appeal was taken to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals and that court affirmed the judgement.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.714" offset="1130245">Thereafter appellant review was sought in this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.723" offset="1142262">We sought review by filing a notice of appeal in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals and docketing a jurisdictional statement in this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.480" offset="1173295">On October 10, 1972 this court entered an order placing this case on its hearing calendar but postponing the question of jurisdiction until the argument of the case on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.382" offset="1216867">Accordingly I return to that threshold question.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.607" offset="1229824">Strictly speaking of course, it is not a question of this courts appellate jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.846" offset="1246751">For all parties can see that this court has a jurisdiction to review the judgement of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.414" offset="1277053">The question is rather a statutory question.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.953" offset="1287189">The mode or the manner by which we should have invoked this court's appellate jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.441" offset="1313102">It is our contention that when congress as it has done in the District of Columbia Courts, creates a local court system and vest that local court system with jurisdiction to hear local matters and provides that appeals from the highest local court shall we taken to this court in accordance with the general provision of section 1257 of the Judicial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.146" offset="1411950">Locally applicable laws constitute a law of a state within the meaning of 1257 subdivision 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.910" offset="1442983">For that proposition we place of course, principal reliance on the analogous case of Balzac against Porto Rico, decided 50 years ago where congress provided the judgments of the Supreme Court of Porto Rico would be reviewed in this court, in accordance with 1257 and the issue in Balzac was whether or not a statute applicable exclusively to Porto Rico was there by dimmed to be a statute of a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.472" offset="1541308">In a unanimous opinion written by Chief Justice Taft, this court held that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.346" offset="1560743">Now it's quite as the government points out that the legislature that had enacted the statute in Balzac was a territorial legislature not the United States congress but that fact played no articulable part in this court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.493" offset="1621347">Rather the Chief Justice focused on the manifesting intent of congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.293" offset="1640573">A point of course, which this court reiterated just last month in the Canter case, the intent of congress in enacting and providing for such a method of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.015" offset="1679444">For reason set forth in Balzac and articulated in our opinion, we think this case is properly heard on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.409" offset="1705044">At the outset of course, by the filing right jurisdiction papers and again in our brief we have invoked in the alternative, the certiorari jurisdiction of this court in the even that we are on.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.743" offset="1746317">But of course, having the case here whether by certiorari or appeal does not answer the question which was raised and overruled in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.317" offset="1780590">Was appellant entitled to have his case heard and determined by a constitutional court?</text>
            <text syncTime="425.768" offset="1806399">Article III discussions tend frequently to become academic and there are several nuances in Article III issues and the parties have pursued those in their brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="808.190" offset="3336129">In other words, if anyone is to get these benefits other than perhaps judges, if any litigant is a felony litigant must have them because no other place that we can conceive would rise to greater constitutional dignity.</text>

            <text syncTime="888.489" offset="3657331">Right, our contention, of course, is that the original constitution and certain protections in the first Ten Amendments, for example, grand jury indictment Article 3 in Sixth Amendment trial by jury are of course rights which are afforded litigants when the Federal Judicial powers brought to bed, not necessarily required under the Fourteenth Amendment in the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.288" offset="3732564">We make no contention that there is anything fundamentally unfair in the Fourteenth Amendment sense about having judges with limited tenure.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.193" offset="3764120">Our proposition is the framers gave a right in Article 3 beyond that, which Fourteenth Amendment due process would require to be afforded.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.050" offset="3799542">Government says that because under the supremacy clause, Congress could argue and though require State courts to hear and determine federal felonies that’s the end of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.508" offset="3841442">If they can require this case to be heard in a State court, the Government argues.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.419" offset="3857011">Then of course, a State court judge following up on Your Honor's proposition would not hold life tenure and why are we entitled to it?</text>
            <text syncTime="945.222" offset="3884283">I suggest the distinction which Your Honor's question focuses is precisely the fallacy of the Government's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.838" offset="3906748">In the first place, when a State court hears a case, whether or not that case arises under State law or arises out of an active Congress which the State is enforcing under the supremacy clause, the State is exercising the State's judicial power, not the judicial power of the United States and Article 3 by its terms is a limitation on Federal not State judicial power and taken one step further, the proposition that was addressed by the Chief Justice's question, the Government's position puts Federal Courts on the plain of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.706" offset="4042167">The Government's argument carried to its logical extension, create a non-article 3 court because you could create a state, you could require a State court to do it, means that any right that a federal defendant has that a Fourteenth Amendment defendant in the State court does not have could be deprived and I don't think that is the law, I don't think the Congress can deprive a federal litigant of a grand jury enticement, even though a state may not have to provide it or of an Article 3 jury or of an Article 3 judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.826" offset="4154702">What then does the Government argue beyond that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.472" offset="4165256">The Government relies, of course, on the legislative court cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.994" offset="4179362">The Government says that there is a judicial power outside of Article 3 which is co-extensive with that conferred in Article 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.978" offset="4215306">This Court has never so held, this Court has never so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.685" offset="4230144">In the permanent part of the United States, this Court has always carefully looked at the nature of the matter being adjudicated by the so-called Legislative Court and if that matter was a subject for which the litigant had to right to claim judicial determination, if it was subject to being disposed off by exercise of another power, legislative or executive, then the Court has said, it is permissible to have the matter adjudicated in a Legislative Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.253" offset="4356368">There has never been even a piece of dicta in one of this Court's legislative court cases which would suggest that a non-article 3 court could hear and determine a felony and impose a felony punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1580.734" offset="6426311">It came to this court with no other basis for Article III jurisdiction except the construction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.617" offset="6453791">We have collected in our brief, similar cases which go back through the 19th century and we have cited in our brief from the very first territorial court case incidentally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.145" offset="6487960">American Insurance Company v.

            <text syncTime="1620.750" offset="6586389">The question then finally arises is there something in the plenary legislative power given Congress under Section 17 rather clause 17 of the Article I, Section 8, the so called plenary power over the District of Columbia that somehow relates to the constitutional right at stake here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.703" offset="6658173">We say not, we say not for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.574" offset="6669667">First, that plenary power is not limited to the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.829" offset="6686699">That's the power that provides not only for exclusive legislation over the seat of government but also of course Federal Enclaves and forts out in several states so that this argument is not strictly limited to the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.607" offset="6737795">Beyond that this court has always held and I think correctly that when you are dealing with the exclusive and the plenary legislative power of congress that may mean congress is free of any other restriction in Article I but it does not exempts Congress from other provision in the body or the bill of rights of the constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1857.034" offset="7531499">The reason that bids me to say that Your Honor is there is nothing else in the appointing part of Article 2 that distinguishes judges from those inferior officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.977" offset="7563264">In other words, Article 2 reads that unless Congress shall by law otherwise provide the presidential appoint and the congress shall give their advice in consent but by law congress may vest the appointment of the inferior officers in the present law and order in ahead of a department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.261" offset="7632436">Now the final, of course, question raised by this case is whether or not, we were entitled to have our notion to suppress granted by a constitutional judge or by a non-constitutional judge, that is a separate issue and it's an issue equally dis-positive of this case; for on this record without the evidence we sought to have suppress, there is no evidence to support appellant's conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.575" offset="7729716">That requires, of course, written briefly in the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.528" offset="7741524">They are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.029" offset="7747480">At the trial court, appellant and his witness gave a different version of this encounter than did the police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.030" offset="7771512">We have not contained it on appeal and we do not contained here that the trial judge was bound to believe our witness rather our position is on the police officers version of the events.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.001" offset="7815398">Appellants right to be free from unreasonable seizures was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.225" offset="7832221">What were the facts?</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.414" offset="7837027">Appellant was driving a car by 8'0 clock in the evening on the 600 Block of T-Street in Downtown Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.491" offset="7865344">At that point in time, he had violated no law, no traffic ordinance, he had no apparent equipment defect and there is no contention, there has been no contention in any court below and there is no contention here, that the officers were possessed of any articulable facts to show that he had been, was or was about to be engaged in any criminal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.574" offset="7945697">This was a matter of a specific finding by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.206" offset="7960221">Two plain clothes officers assign to the special operations division of the District of Columbia Police Department decided that they would stop appellant for what has been described in this record as a spot-check or a traffic-check or in one place, a rental agreement check.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.067" offset="8023646">They turned on their red lights and their siren and they force the appellant to the side of the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.088" offset="8043708">Appellant produce the driver's license and was asked to return to the car and obtain a copy of his rental agreement form and I interject the officers of plain, that they knew this was a rental agreement car rather a rental car because of the special serial numbers on the license plate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.647" offset="8113925">An officer was thereupon engaged in discussing with appellant, an appellant discrepancy in the exploration date of his rental agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.458" offset="8145168">When a fellow officer who had been on the passenger side of the car shining a flashlight into the interior discovered the gun, sees the gun and arrested appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.204" offset="8184142">Our contention is at the moment appellant was stopped, at the moment he was stopped for this license at spot-check, his Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable seizures had been infringed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.140" offset="8231894">It is important to point out that in this case there is no congressional statute which on its face, purports to authorize police officers to stop citizens for purpose of inspecting either driver's licenses or motor vehicle registrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.697" offset="8298141">The statutes do require that citizens carry both of those documents while they operate a car.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.110" offset="8319770">And the driver's license statute does require that a citizen display that license to a police officer but it does not specifically provide that the officer is entitle to stop in order to ask for the display.</text>

            <text syncTime="2102.175" offset="8512031">I think it's up to me to pick people out and I pick rental cars because I think a lot of them are overdue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.071" offset="8539617">I want to see if the man can prove that it's not overdue because it's a crime if it is overdue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2177.105" offset="8811813">I think I should call to the courts attention, the case which was decided in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and we were unable to include it in our brief so that we will shortly do so in a formal amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.448" offset="8853191">You know we only get the opinion yesterday, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the case is Commonwealth against Swanger has since squarely so held.</text>

            <text syncTime="2503.943" offset="10119189">For if it should be concluded as I hope it will not, that criminal cases in the District of Columbia can be heard only by Article 3 Courts, then these tribunals are not courts for they do not meet their requirement of Article 3 particularly as the tenure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.411" offset="10193063">The judges of these courts are appointed for 15 year term; they don't serve during a period of good behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.400" offset="10229008">This court has only appellate jurisdiction in cases such as these and if the tribunal below is not validly established.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.320" offset="10260668">It's not a court, and this court has no jurisdiction to review its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.364" offset="10284805">The remedy in such a case would appear to be by writ of habeas corpus in the District Court of United States for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.899" offset="10327019">But if the tribunal below is a court then we have left the question which is discussed in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.524" offset="10361501">Congress has power to regulate the appellate jurisdiction of this court and has done so in Section 1257 of Title 28 of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.096" offset="10419806">It is paragraph 2 which provides for appeal to this court to review a decision “rendered by the highest court of the state”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.328" offset="10476648">Where there is “drawn in question the validity of a statute of any state on the ground of it's being repugnant to the Constitution's treaties or laws of the United States and the decision is in favor of its validity”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.373" offset="10548851">Now these words alone would of course not be sufficient to support jurisdiction here for we have neither a decision of the highest court of the state, nor do we have involved the validity of a statute of any state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.432" offset="10613112">Since the court below is one established for the District of Columbia by Congress, and the statute whose validity is question was not enacted by a state, but by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.255" offset="10668387">The first of these matters is taken care of in the statute itself by amendment which was enacted as a part of the District of Columbia court Reorganization Act of 1970 and it is printed on page 4 of our brief at the end of our printing of Section 1257.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.987" offset="10763368">It added a paragraph there which provides that for the purposes of this section the term highest court of the state includes the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, so that half of the problem is resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.101" offset="10831809">But there still remains the question whether the decision below involves a validity of a statute of any state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.380" offset="10868903">Can those words be construed to apply to a statute which was passed by both houses of Congress, signed by the President and was never considered by the legislature of any state or indeed of any territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.545" offset="10933582">If Congress meant that, it could have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.500" offset="10949360">It knew how to do that in this very act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.585" offset="10965661">For it did provide in Section 172-C1 of the act adding Section 1363 to title 28 of the United States Code that laws applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia should not be considered “laws of the United States” or “Acts of Congress”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.894" offset="11066911">For the purposes of that provision, Congress made no similar provision for a special modification of the plain words, plain meaning of the words statute of any state in Section 1257-2.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.800" offset="11146533">Reliance is placed on this court's decision in Balzac against Puerto Rico decided in 1922 in an opinion by Chief Justice Taft, but that decision is clearly distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.367" offset="11208808">In the first place there was a considerable history to the statutory provision involved there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.565" offset="11237648">It is too complicated to give in detail here, but it is readily apparent from reading the opinion, the interrelation of then Sections 237 and 246 of the judicial code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.417" offset="11293027">The statute with respect to Puerto Rico was linked to the provision with respect to Hawaii and Congress has said that it wanted review here which was comparable to that in cases coming from the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.972" offset="11351228">On that basis a statute passed by the Legislature of Puerto Rico was held to be a statute of a state for the purpose of what is now Section 1257, taken in the light of other statutory provisions than enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.820" offset="11426670">But here we do not have a statute passed by a territorial legislature or any other outside body.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.175" offset="11460106">The statute here was passed by Congress itself after extensive consideration there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.857" offset="11490826">Congress has never provided for an appeal from decisions sustaining the validity of its own statutes, and there is no reason for forcing a construction on the statute here to reach that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.781" offset="11542444">If that were done, defendants in the DC courts could question the validity of every provision in the DC Criminal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.215" offset="11576195">And the validity of statutory provision against murder or burglary for example and then when their contentions were denied by the court below, they would have a right of appeal to this court if the validity of the statute was sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.559" offset="11645576">The position for which we contend seems to be sustain likewise by this court's recent decision in Fornaris against Ridge Tool Company in 400 US at -- it begins on page 41 and the jurisdictional question is decided in a long footnote on page 42.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.924" offset="11755081">There are something’s about that footnote which are not crystal clear to me, but among other things the court did not cite the Balzac case which would seem to had some relevance, but record does make it perfectly plain that for purposes of appeal from the United States Court of Appeals a statute of Puerto Rico is not an act -- is not a statute of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.275" offset="11896456">I should think therefore that the Fornaris case together with the language of the statute itself should lead to the conclusion that this court has no jurisdiction of the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.166" offset="11956015">If there is a court below which can be reviewed here, and I think there is, then the papers should be considered by the court as a petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.725" offset="12010245">And I will turn next to the second and in some way the major question involves here, although all are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.388" offset="12048906">The question is the constitutional validity of the District of Columbia and Court Reorganization Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.284" offset="12084537">In approaching this question as other questions, the Constitution should, of course, not be thought of as a mathematical equation or as some kind of computer program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.301" offset="12144619">As it has been said in largest part, the constitution is not a charter liberties but a blueprint for a federal system of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.821" offset="12190699">And the District of Colombia is in someway is the keystone of the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.133" offset="12215881">Marvelous says it was the work of the founding fathers in Philadelphia in 1787.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.465" offset="12241272">There were something that they did not fully foresee or spell out in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.880" offset="12262902">And it has been this court's task to work these problems out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.252" offset="12292368">This particular area of the interplay of Article III and Article-I has a sort of academic flavor to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.726" offset="12338239">And it may be an understatement to say that it has not always received wholly consistent treatment from this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.793" offset="12374497">Decisions have been made by divided courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.930" offset="12387140">Sometimes without a majority and statements can be found in the opinions to support almost any position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.296" offset="12424547">I have myself been burned once in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.927" offset="12443042">In 1929, this court decide Ex Parte Bakelite Corporation in 279U.S., a unanimous decision with the opinion written by Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER who was in acknowledge authority on constitutional procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.792" offset="12514513">And I would have to differ with Mr. Flegal when he said that there wasn’t even dictum which said there could be article-I courts in the District of Colombia because that opinion discuss the question in extend so and concluded that the courts of the district Colombia where article-I courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.200" offset="12592149">Now it’s true that the issue in the case was the status of the then court of costumes appeals but and so therefore there is a dictum not a decision but it was clear sort of considered dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.787" offset="12670516">These court where there known as the Supreme Court of the District of Colombia and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Colombia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.743" offset="12702386">The case also considered the court of claims and for clear and cogent regions based long outstanding president the court found all of these tribunals where validly established under article-I of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.667" offset="12774066">It was only 4 years later that the case of O'Donoghue and of Williams came before this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.899" offset="12810951">I was then a junior in the department of justice and was one of those who wrote the brief for the United States in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.150" offset="12843969">The question was whether the judges of these courts were protected by the provision in article III which says that the salaries of the judges can not be reduced during their terminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.264" offset="12892453">Under the circumstances we did not brief the question extensively but relied on the comprehensive treatment in the Bakelite case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.011" offset="12931427">As things worked out, this court's Bakelite decision proved to be a slander read as far is the District of Colombia was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.421" offset="12969044">For Judge O'Donoghue who was held to be entitled to his salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.327" offset="12988688">Judge Williams was not so fortunate but he was indicated more than 30 years later with the aid of an intervening act of Congress and establishing both the court of claims and the court of-- appeals as article III courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.178" offset="13068100">The Sams have been shifting in this area but I do no think that they have shifted enough or that they should be shifted enough to invalidate the District of Colombia court reorganization Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.635" offset="13141870">The approach in this field it seems to me it should be that suggested by Mr. Justice Harlan, in an opinion he wrote, in an analogous case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.725" offset="13202265">The case was read in Culver involving the validity of a trial by court martial of a woman who had murdered her air force husband at an air base in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.909" offset="13246986">His words which I do not cite as authority but only for their indication of an approach to this case we are directly applicable to trials overseas as applied to this case they would read.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.795" offset="13302575">In other words what Ross and the Insular case is hold is that the particular local setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.653" offset="13329951">The practical necessities and the possible alternatives are relevant to a question of judgment on question such as these.</text>

            <text syncTime="3317.748" offset="13374360">I think we have above thought is crucial in approaching the case is before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.020" offset="13395466">Decision is easy if one adopts the constricting view that these constitutional guarantees as a totality do or do not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.787" offset="13442487">But for me the question is which guarantees of the constitution should apply in view of the particular circumstances, the practical necessities and the possible alternatives which Congress had before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.222" offset="13504240">The question is one of judgment not of compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.732" offset="13534333">In considering this question of judgment, we note that there is surely no constitutional requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.233" offset="13564322">They are all federal cases; all federal criminal prosecutions must be heard by article III courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.415" offset="13600998">The constitution establishes no inferior federal courts at all but leaves that entirely to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.734" offset="13634330">In Australia, for example there are no federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.857" offset="13646764">All commonwealth criminal prosecutions are conducted in the State Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.195" offset="13676126">We might well have had such a system here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.052" offset="13695561">Expect for a period of one year, Congress provided no Federal Courts with federal question jurisdiction until 1875.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.807" offset="13734640">Even, today many federal question cases can not be heard in article III courts if they do not meet the jurisdictional amount established by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.929" offset="13779048">That means that these cases must be heard by State Courts almost none of which meet the article III test as to tenure and non-reduction of salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.719" offset="13830248">From the very earliest days of the republic, Congress provided for the trial of many criminal cases in state courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3741.701" offset="15070124">Now very likely the Ross case would not be followed now, because there weren't really judges there, just councilor officers and they acted as prosecutor, judge, and jury, at least foreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.160" offset="15131982">The objection during Re Ross is essentially one of due process though and not of Article III and this was taken care of the 1906, when there was established, the United States Court for China, with power to review councilor decisions and to handle all of these cases for all of China.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.211" offset="15220172">The judge of this court and I can tell you this, Mr. Justice, the judge of this court was appointed for 10 years, and he could be removed by the President for cause, the statute said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.582" offset="15265729">For many years, the judge was a man named Lubinger (ph) and I used to see him from time to time in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.143" offset="15291956">Apparently, he wasn't too busy in China, he did a good deal of legal writing including some about the United States Court for China.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.038" offset="15331558">I have not been able to find in any case from that court came to this Court for review, but there is at least one reported review of a criminal case in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and this is Biddle against the United States in 156 Federal not F 2nd, 156 Federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.790" offset="15414523">It was a prosecution for taking money by false pretences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3831.920" offset="15431032">The defendant was convicted and sentenced to a year in the jail in Shanghai, and on appeal, this was reversed not because of any defect in the court, but because the apparent court concluded that the facts alleged in the charge did not constitute false pretences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.082" offset="15511698">Now these instances are enough to show that federal questions including criminal charges need not be inevitably heard only by courts which are established with Article III guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3866.485" offset="15569272">State courts do not meet that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.073" offset="15583692">There were United States criminal prosecutions in State Courts in the very early days of the republic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3876.410" offset="15608978">Territorial Courts do not meet that test; Councilor Courts don't meet the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.142" offset="15639907">I might even add that regularly established United States courts do not meet that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3891.674" offset="15670105">When a judge sits under a recess appointment then I am unaware of any decision, which says that a judgment rendered in such cases invalid because the Article III guarantees have not been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="3907.237" offset="15732276">Now it can be said well there is a special constitutional provision about recess appointment, but so as there are special constitutional provision with respect to the territories of the United States and with respect to the District of Columbia.</text>

            <text syncTime="4078.838" offset="16418774">Of course there was no guarantee in Maryland that the Judges of the state courts having jurisdiction over the general run of crimes, would have guarantees like those provided by Article III, and except for four states today, are state judges who handle all the ordinary criminal and civil business in the country do not have such guarantees, but the district is in the United States, not outside of it, and therefore it is said the Article III guarantees must apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="4172.438" offset="16793161">With respect to the District of Columbia, it was for many years thought and generally understood, and I say that without any hesitation, it was for many years thought and generally understood, I think right down to the day O'Donoghue case was decided, that all of the courts here were established under Article I.</text>
            <text syncTime="4198.918" offset="16899009">It was on that basis that they were given various administrative powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4204.329" offset="16920639">It was felt going back to the very earliest decisions of this court that Article III courts could not be assigned non-judicial functions and it was on that basis that it was felt that all of the District of Columbia court must be Article I courts because they pointed members with the school board may have reviewed decisions of the patent office which did not result in final judgments and they did various things which was then understood that Article III judges could not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4237.114" offset="17051878">Certainly, this court understood that they were all Article I courts when it decided the Bakelite case in 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="4245.959" offset="17087195">Now the Bakelite case is perhaps somewhat under plate here, it's fairly far back in the stream of history on this thing, but the Bakelite case represented an understanding which I think was general over a period of 50 or 75 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4261.443" offset="17149158">It was only under the pressure of a salary reduction question which conceivably might have affected the result that this court saw a new light in 1933, and that light was not bright enough then to illuminate the court of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="4284.445" offset="17241109">Moreover, from the beginning there have always been Article I courts and judges in the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="4293.822" offset="17278621">Justices of the peace, police court, municipal court and more recently the court of general session, courts with limited jurisdiction to be sure, but surely exercising judicial power including substantial jurisdiction in criminal cases and if the judicial power of the United States can only be given to Article III courts, those courts and all the acts under them were surely invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4328.665" offset="17418010">It is said that the district is different from the territories because they were transitory while, the district is permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4339.169" offset="17460015">It's not clear why this makes a difference under Article III, Article III doesn't say anything about transitory or permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4347.999" offset="17495333">But as to the transitory nature of the territories, we have had Puerto Rico and Guam and American Samoa now for 75 years and the Virgin Islands now for more than 55 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4367.500" offset="17573386">It is said that they are distant, but it takes only a couple of hours to get from here to Washington -- get from Washington to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and there is instant communication with all of these places.</text>
            <text syncTime="4384.556" offset="17641618">The people there are citizens of United States, no less and no mores then those of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="4393.771" offset="17678503">Moreover, the government of the district is not changeless.</text>
            <text syncTime="4399.930" offset="17703058">There is a great deal of current talk about home rule and changes in Congress may mean that this is more likely than it once was.</text>
            <text syncTime="4410.985" offset="17747362">There is also a talk about statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="4415.625" offset="17765857">There would be a considerable problem in achieving changes such as these, if it should be concluded that they should be brought above, if more than 50 judges on the two court's below in this case had to be provided for life and it should not be overlooked that this statute was enacted by the Congress as a result of a clear crises in the District Court of United States for the District of Columbia which was simply overwhelmed by the volume of its criminal business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4454.059" offset="17919561">Practically all of the judges were sitting on criminal cases all of the time and the ordinary work of the District Courts could not be carried forward and the congress provided this means greatly to expand the number of judges in the District of Columbia assigned to deal with local crimes and civil matters of the same sort that are dealt with by state courts in the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4484.486" offset="18041292">It would be a bit bizarre if the District of Columbia became a state to say that the 50 judges of these two courts below must be given life tenure if the state court judges established by the state under statehood trying the same kind of cases would not have to have Article III guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4510.662" offset="18145991">The congress expressly grants the constitution, expressly grants to Congress in Article I, clause 17, power to exercise exclusive jurisdiction in all cases whatsoever and really what could be more comprehensive, exclusive jurisdiction in all cases whatsoever over the district that is accepted as a seat of government of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4537.376" offset="18252884">This court has said that this is a plenary part, there is no doubt that the district is different from other parts of the country, both legally and practically, until recently changed by constitutional amendment residence of the district did not have that most elemental right in the democracy, the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4561.439" offset="18349119">They still have no representation in the senate and no voting representation in the house, though these bodies pass the laws that govern the district and levy the taxes that are applicable here.</text>

            <text syncTime="4746.752" offset="19090369">It simply asserts that Article III does not rigidly preclude congress from exercising some flexibility in allocating that judicial business and that Congress may make a particular allocation to a non-article III tribunal, if functional considerations of serving a valid legislative purpose justified and if there is adequate provision for judicial review or here there is provision for judicial review in all cases to this court which is of course in Article III court and then I would like to say that nothing in our position requires the court to overrule or to disapprove anything decided in the O'Donoghue case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4791.215" offset="19268211">The courts there were held to be both Article III and Article I courts but there was nothing there which held that congress could not create courts under article I to deal with local matters only.</text>

            <text syncTime="4810.064" offset="19343653">But do you think the majority of the O'Donoghue Court would have decided this case the way the District of Columbia Court of Appeals did?</text>

            <text syncTime="4832.949" offset="19435186">In 1933 when they were deciding it they didn't have the history that had developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4841.173" offset="19468100">The courts established the declaration of Congress that it was creating these courts under Article I.</text>
            <text syncTime="4848.348" offset="19496730">If all of those provisions had been before the Court in 1933 then my answer would be yes, that they would have accepted the – let me -- I mentioned some of the practical problems before Congress and legislating here the difficulty of giving life tenure to 50-60 judges which were needed but there is also another practical problem and that is fazing in the judges under the old system into the new.</text>
            <text syncTime="4876.118" offset="19607803">The judges of the Court of General Sessions have not been appointed as Article III judges and a means of making a transition was to establish Article I courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4889.039" offset="19659525">Then we do not contend that Congress could create courts generally under Article I to sit all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4897.627" offset="19693902">Though I would refer to the United States Tax Court which again Congress has validly created under Article I without life tenure and it does sit all over the country but it has no criminal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4911.255" offset="19748342">Congress could not displace the Article III courts in the states by establishing Article I courts with general jurisdiction or by a series of Article I courts under the commerce power and the tax power and other powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4924.929" offset="19803094">Our position this simply that Congress has broader powers over governmental organization in the district than it has in the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4935.910" offset="19846980">Now let return to the final subject involved in the case, the question of the seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4943.793" offset="19878536">This is one of considerable importance to the government and I hope that I have not left it buried under a mass of technicalities in presenting the other questions involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4954.990" offset="19923362">The basic question is whether a policeman may make a selective stop of a motorist for the purpose of checking his driver's license and registration certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4966.398" offset="19968920">The District of Columbia law requires an operator to have these papers in his possession or in the automobile and that must mean something.</text>
            <text syncTime="4974.709" offset="20002252">It's not just ceremony that he has to have the papers in his position there to be there so that they can be shown on proper occasion unless they can be checked by a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4984.859" offset="20042794">There is no way to tell whether motor vehicles which are surely dangerous instrumentalities are being validly operated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4992.482" offset="20073305">Here the check was no whim.</text>
            <text syncTime="4994.805" offset="20082604">The police officer could tell from the license plate that the car was a rental car.</text>
            <text syncTime="4999.810" offset="20102562">He knew that many rental cars were held over time which is unlawful or re-stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5006.288" offset="20128475">In this case the whole rental agreement did indeed indicate that the car was overdue, though this was straightened out when inquiry was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5014.636" offset="20161912">There is no allegation that the police officer acted improperly, that is in a violent or a vicious manner.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="5077.009" offset="20411434">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5077.991" offset="20415300">Prior to 1971 Mr. Justice, the Tax Court, in first place it was the Board of Tax Appeal, then it was established as the Tax court but because of a curious history, the statute expressly provided that it is an independent agency and the executive branch for the government and that lasted till 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="5095.575" offset="20485622">And during that time it was quite clear that this court could not review a decision of the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5101.507" offset="20509445">Indeed there is a case back 30 years ago involving a certificate from a Court of Appeals with respect to a question from the tax court and this is – I may say this court was always very careful.</text>
            <text syncTime="5114.487" offset="20561272">Never to remand their decision to the tax court, it always remanded it to the Court of Appeals for remand to the tax court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5124.129" offset="20599933">But here, there was nothing discriminatory and thus stop many citizens would welcome that has evidence that the police where doing their duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5135.612" offset="20645804">Incidentally, the statute of the District of Columbia does not say that the policeman may stop the car, but it does say expressly that any individual to whom has been issued a permit to operate a motor vehicle shall add such permit in his immediate possession at all times, when operating a motor vehicle in the District and shall exhibit such permit to any police officer when demand is made therefore.</text>
            <text syncTime="5171.588" offset="20789687">This case we think is like the Biswell case, where people realizes to deal in firearms and this Court held that they were subject to inspect it, indeed said that it is to be effective in service a credible deterrent unannounced even frequent inspections are essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="5194.946" offset="20883205">If a motor is chooses to drive pursuant to a license for which he has applied, he does so with a knowledge that he maybe required at any time to establish that he is doing so in unconformity with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5208.201" offset="20936182">Under the circumstances such checks post at most only limited threats to the motorist privacy, and no threat which is not justified by his acceptance of the license and the operation under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5220.855" offset="20986755">I note that persons who wish to enter this court room they have to submit themselves to an inspection which includes the opening of parcels, and the opening of ladies handbag, I would not suppose there was any question about that and I see no basis for a question in the light of the District of Columbia statute with respect to the request for licenses in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5243.995" offset="21079333">If the stock was proper, the protective action of Officer Morris had and looking to see if there are any weapons available was clearly proper under the general rationale of Terry against Ohio and the search should be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="5263.374" offset="21156864">If the court reaches the merits of the case, the judgment of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</text>
