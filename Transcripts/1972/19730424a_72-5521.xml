            <text syncTime="32.560" offset="233618">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.292" offset="248560">This case recently began a serious examination of the right to a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.559" offset="277608">It began with the United States versus Marion where this Court determined when the right to a speedy trial attaches and continue with Barker versus Wingo in which this Court enunciated the balancing formula to be applied in making ad hoc determinations as to whether or not that right has been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.516" offset="353468">This Court today is called upon to determine the sole issue of remedy to be applied upon a finding of a denial of a speedy trial this was the basic issue or the basic question framed in the petition writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.564" offset="413654">The Government in its brief however, wishes to raise as an additional issue the question whether the Court of Appeals made a proper ad hoc determination in finding that Mr. Strunk in this case had been denied his right to a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.955" offset="475199">And because I don’t know whether this Court wishes to consider re-examination of those findings of the Court of Appeals I will give a broad statement of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.035" offset="511561">This case began on June 30, 1969 when Clarence Strunk stole the car in Wisconsin and shortly thereafter drove at the Illinois where he abandoned it.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.147" offset="547924">He eventually made his way to the State of Nebraska where on July 24, 1969 he was arrested on a state charge of burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.405" offset="588988">On a plea of guilty to a reduced charge of larceny he received a one to three-year sentence in the Nebraska State Penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.148" offset="623992">While in Nebraska custody on September 3, 1969 at his own request he was seen by an FBI agent, at which time he was advised of his rights and he signed a waiver form.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.086" offset="659728">At the time of that interview, he made detailed admissions pertaining to the facts of the crime that he had committed and he further indicated to the FBI agent that it was his intension “To demand a speedy trial under Rule 20.”</text>
            <text syncTime="162.135" offset="751888">On December 17, 1969 the U.S Attorney in the District of Nebraska wrote to the U.S Attorney in the Eastern District of Illinois and in his letter indicated that Mr. Strunk desired to enter a plea under Rule 20 and on the following day the U.S. Attorney of Illinois sent in Nebraska the necessary forms required to process a case under Rule 20.</text>

            <text syncTime="197.623" offset="893889">On May 26, 1970 after no further word was received from Nebraska the U.S Attorney in Illinois presented this matter to the grand jury and an indictment was returned on that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.142" offset="955956">On August 13, 1970, correspondence was receive by the U.S Attorney in the Eastern District of Illinois from his counterpart in Nebraska indicating that Mr. Strunk definitely refused to enter a plea under Rule 20 and that he intended to raise and issue a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.138" offset="1023875">As the Court of Appeals put it, thereafter nothing happened until February 9, 1971 when Mr. Strunk was brought to East St. Louis, Illinois on a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.140" offset="1079881">And there in the District Court for the Eastern District of Illinois he was arraigned at which time counsel was appointed a plea of not guilty was entered and trial was set for March 29, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.848" offset="1134738">Prior to the trial, Mr. Strunk’s counsel move for a dismissal of the indictment for want of speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.080" offset="1159711">The motion was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.220" offset="1168280">He went to trial as originally scheduled on March 29, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.637" offset="1185938">He was tried by a jury, he did not take the stand and he offered no affirmative defense and he was found guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.972" offset="1215300">He received a sentence of five years imprisonment which sentence was to run concurrently with the sentence he was then serving in Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.174" offset="1252080">An appeal was taken at that point I was appointed counsel for Mr. Strunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.718" offset="1270262">Our case was argued on May 30, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.858" offset="1286771">On June 22, 1972 the decision in Barker versus Wingo came down.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.852" offset="1310804">It was recognized by the Court of Appeals and it was a controlling case applied to the facts in the instant case.</text>

            <text syncTime="311.024" offset="1347480">Is it correct that an about 2-1/2 months more or less was delayed by reason of this discussion of plea of nolo contendere?</text>

            <text syncTime="325.156" offset="1404008">There was some delay on that and in fact that subject was treated within the findings of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.526" offset="1429504">What the Court of Appeals said they concluded first I will start with the conclusion they said that no part of the delay after the indictment was attributable to Mr. Strunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.883" offset="1474853">The Court said that he did not have counsel at that time that he may have seem to have desire to proceed under Rule 20, and in fact when he was quoted as having said that he wish to demand a speedy trial under Rule 20, it did not make any sense to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.509" offset="1553429">If anything, it seemed to be an assertion of his right to a speedy trial a desire for a speedy trial which of course he didn’t get.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.745" offset="1590314">Now the Court of Appeals found that the length of the delay in this case between indictment and arraignment was 259 days and they felt that it was in --</text>

            <text syncTime="582.410" offset="2433024">It’s the possibility of this loss and of course the possibility did in fact become true in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.044" offset="2459564">The court in our case acknowledged that dismissal of the indictment was the traditional remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.729" offset="2482239">However they felt that, that was a drastic relief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.908" offset="2494986">Accordingly, they remanded the case with direction that Mr. Strunk be given 259 days credit on his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.740" offset="2534379">I would like to point out one thing parenthetically.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.700" offset="2542216">The Government in its brief asserts that the petitioner somehow believes that the remedy applied below was appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.104" offset="2571786">Well, of course if that’s true I don’t know why I am here today but in any event the briefs in the case below were written prior to the Barker versus Wingo decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.950" offset="2623195">And we know that the Barker dicta contain some very interesting language on the subject of remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.720" offset="2650258">Furthermore, in my briefs below I listed a series of alternative relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.833" offset="2682755">I did that in the event that if no finding of the denial of speedy trial were arrived at that if the court found some other error that was amenable to correction I wanted a tender relief that they might resort to.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.992" offset="2735313">Now technically, the issue below before the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals was whether or not the District Court adhered in denying Mr. Strunk’s motion to dismiss his indictment for want of a speedy trial and we submit that the perspective of the Court of Appeals was fixed by that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.109" offset="2827786">And that it was obliged to view the facts in analysis in that case from the same perspective as to Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.583" offset="2861746">Now the issue would necessarily require the court to make a determination as to whether or not there was a violation of the right, and since the Court of Appeals found the denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.267" offset="2900407">It is reasonable that District Court should have found the denial of the right to a speedy trial and had the District Court done so, we submit that the one thing that it could not do at that point was to order Mr. Strunk to trial not withstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.136" offset="2959966">Yet this was the effect of the remedy that was applied by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.214" offset="2984208">The Government in its brief suggest that the District Court while finding a denial of a speedy trial could order Mr. Strunk to trial despite that fact adding that in the event he were convicted they would couple a ruling which would say that he could be given credit on his sentence for whatever unjustified delay occurred in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.069" offset="3063620">The difficulty with that argument is that it, it ignores that at time of the finding Mr. Strunk was presumed innocent and if on trial he refuted the result would have been an admitted denial of the right with no remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.202" offset="3128195">And this is serious we submit because it judicially repeals the word “speedy” from the Sixth Amendment and merely leaves an accused with the right to be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.047" offset="3183574">Now, we are also arguing in this case here that the remedy applied below if permitted to stand will encourage Government prosecutors to give low priority to cases of the sort involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.982" offset="3223280">That is where you have an accused who is a prisoner in another jurisdiction on a related charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.568" offset="3253687">Now if a prosecutor can reasonably anticipate that the only prejudice to be suffered by an accused is this Smith versus Hooey type of undue and oppressive incarceration prior to trial he is really under no duty to exercise diligence in bringing the accused to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.970" offset="3319202">For the District Court presumably can compensate for a violation of the right in the event of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.658" offset="3346056">Now since an accused such as Strunk can be seemingly made hold the prosecutors will decide a low priority to such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.183" offset="3380120">Now the Government in its brief asserts that there’s no substance to this position and I have difficulty understanding how they can make that assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.788" offset="3414497">I would like to call the Court’s attention specifically to page 10 in the Government’s brief where the Government in endeavoring to explain the delay in bringing Mr. Strunk to trial admits that in this case prosecutorial resources were devoted to other active cases commanding a higher priority than Mr. Strunk’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.971" offset="3519300">The final point I’d like to make Your Honors, is that we are urging the remedy for a violation of the right to a speedy trial to be absolute discharge.</text>

            <label>Mr. William Bradford Reynolds</label>
            <text syncTime="1355.595" offset="5525713">Well, I planned to address myself to the issue of the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.400" offset="5552985">And I think that, that issue is whether the remedy of the Court of Appeals can properly be accorded by the courts on a finding of a Sixth Amendment speedy trial violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.227" offset="5596244">And that fundamental right to a speedy trial has for many years been defined by the courts in absolute terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.053" offset="5627591">That is that it requires trial within a specified timeframe or that it can be evoked only after a speedy trial has been demanded by the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.935" offset="5671163">Within that relatively rigid framework the finding of the constitutional violation in this area has in the passed almost invariably turned on one of two considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.358" offset="5720795">Either that the delay in bringing the case to trial has been such as too presumptively or actually prejudiced the preparation of the defense of the case or that the delay has been a purpose for one by the prosecutor which was designed against some tactical advantage over the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.504" offset="5805432">Now in both of those situations the most basic notions of fundamental fairness dictate a dismissal of the indictment as the only effective remedy for enforcing the speedy trial right and that not surprisingly has hereto for been the uniform response to the finding of a denial of the constitutional right to a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.416" offset="5901040">Last term, however, this Court in Barker versus Wingo at 407 U.S. examined the speedy trial guarantee in considerable detail and concluded that the right did not by nature land itself to any mechanical test for determining when it had been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.855" offset="5978781">Thus, the Court as Mr. Justice Brennan forecast in his concurring opinion in Dickey versus Florida, the Court announced a more flexible standard for ascertaining whether this fundamental right has been infringed in the circumstances of a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.176" offset="6048057">A standard based on a careful and sensitive balance of four related factors: the length of the delay, the reason for the delay, the assertion by the defendant of his right to a speedy trial, and the prejudice resulting from the delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.176" offset="6116080">And the Court of Appeals look to those factors in the present case and it found on a balanced of those factors that the 10-month delay here between indictment and trial was unconstitutional in the particular circumstances involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.954" offset="6191208">The counsel for petitioner has discussed those circumstances already and I don’t think there’s any need to go into them in any detail at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.570" offset="6237602">I think the important thing is that this pretrial delay is 10-month delay and this is agreed to, did not prejudice the defendant in the preparation of this defense in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.763" offset="6298415">There is no claim of personal prejudice such a loss of liberty or employment or financial resources and alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.222" offset="6328299">Personal prejudice due to the pretrial incarceration because that incarceration was in the Nebraska State Penal Complex and it was solely related to this state conviction for he was serving a one to three-year sentence at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.089" offset="6387754">And it’s also not asserted that the pending federal indictment adversely affected the state confinement or caused him any mental anguish or anxiety that would accompanied public accusation because of the pending indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.120" offset="6447835">Rather the only prejudice claimed by petitioner and the only prejudice found by the Court of Appeals to have resulted from the pretrial delay depended on a concurrent sentence petitioner received following his direct conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.056" offset="6519620">Thus, on the basis of the sentence imposed by the federal judge after the direct conviction on hindsight this 10-month delay cause petitioner to lose time he was serving on his state sentence that would otherwise have run concurrently with the federal sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.678" offset="6610108">Now, if we accept the Court of Appeals decision that the proper balance for Strunk here on the issue of whether there was a violation, the remedy fashioned by the court which petitioner conceives fully cure the only prejudice suffered by crediting him with the time of pretrial incarceration between indictment and arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.721" offset="6702268">That remedy we submit was entirely proper to the extent that the flexible standard announced by this Court in Barker versus Wingo permits a finding of a constitutional speedy trial violation on facts such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.503" offset="6769351">So to flexibility is needed in the remedy phase of the inquiry so that in appropriate cases the courts can tailor their relief to the infringement they find needs to be cured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.839" offset="6826715">And what the Court of Appeals did here was to device relief, less drastic than dismissal of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.006" offset="6855346">Relief which fully restored petitioner to the position he would have been in had there been no unreasonable pretrial delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.044" offset="6895574">By giving petitioner credit on his federal sentence for his incarceration during the period of between indictment and arraignment the Court fashioned relief to vindicate the only interest of the accused that if found had been adversely effected by the Sixth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.974" offset="6979271">Moreover, this relief served far better than with dismissal of the indictment served the societal interest underlying the speedy trial provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.945" offset="7023156">Public concern is with the effective prosecution of criminal cases with reasonable dispatch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.387" offset="7048965">Delays can often work to the Government’s disadvantage by reducing its capacity to try the -- to prove its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.572" offset="7081671">Where however the prosecutions case remain unimpaired by the delay as here and where there’s been no prejudice to the accused in the sense of impairment of his defense or in the sense of personal prejudice due to pretrial incarceration or the public accusation that accompanies return of indictment, as again is the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.871" offset="7182817">Then society’s interest is generally best served by allowing the case to proceed to trial and letting the jury decide whether to acquit or convict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.295" offset="7228583">Now, there is the obvious exception where the prosecutor engages in purposeful delay to gain a tactical advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.274" offset="7256482">As Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out and noting such official misconduct in his dissenting opinion in Chapman versus United States at 386 and I quote, “Society can not tolerate giving final effect to a judgment tainted with such intentional misconduct.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.792" offset="7330565">But there’s no such official abuse of the criminal process involved in this case and as the societal interest in trying people accused of crime is served best not by granting petitioner immunization because of legal error but by fashioning a sentence as did the Court of Appeals to cure whatever possible prejudice he was caused by the unreasonable delay.</text>
