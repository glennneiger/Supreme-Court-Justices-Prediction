            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll hear arguments next in number 71-708, Trafficante against Metropolitan Life and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.882" offset="370918">Mr. Bomse, you may proceed.</text>

          <turn speaker="stephen_v_bomse" startTime="70.173" stopTime="416.413">
            <label>Mr. Stephen V. Bomse</label>
            <text syncTime="70.173" offset="384084">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.934" offset="399130">The issue which we confront here today is whether tenants at a large, privately owned apartment complex have standing to challenge practices of racial discrimination by their landlord, under writ of the 1968 Civil Rights Act, Title 8 thereof or 42 U.S.C, Section 1982, the statute principally interpreted by this Court in its 1968 decision of Jones against Maya.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.009" offset="527444">The petitioners here are both Negro and White residents of Parkmerced, a 3500 unit apartment complex in San Francisco, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.149" offset="571956">They filed a lawsuit under Title 8 and under 1982 alleging that Parkmerced was generally responsible for practices condemned by both of those statutes and refusing occupancy there to members of the Negro race, and other minority races.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.745" offset="654399">Their action was against the landlords responsible for that discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.175" offset="680103">Motions to dismiss were made in the District Court on a variety of grounds and the Court granted those motions, limited however to the question of standing which is before this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.342" offset="736737">The case then went to the Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals where the decision of the District Court was affirmed again, limited solely to the question of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.310" offset="772577">We sought certiorari and that was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.976" offset="791280">It is our submission today that the decision below should be reversed and the petitioners held to have standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.191" offset="836106">In view of the language of the relevant statutes, the clear policies which they embody and the national commitment which I think, none of us would reasonably again say minimize to eliminate racial discrimination from housing not only because that of itself is a crucial problem to our nation today, but because it quite clearly infects our national life in a variety of other circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.561" offset="953657">To recall only the most obvious one, the terribly divisive national controversy over busing has mean to culminating, segregation, and separation of the races in the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.867" offset="1006843">It's in large part a product of the fact that the races in this country leave apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.765" offset="1034428">That fact has been too well documented to really be disputed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.941" offset="1051146">It's been documented by the United States Civil Rights Commission in its notion that we are indeed moving towards two societies, they are not speaking, really in a social or any in tangible sense, we live apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.771" offset="1110497">So what is an issue here is whether the commitment which petitioners submit is embodied in the laws and issue Title 8 of 1982, is going to be broadly or narrowly upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.841" offset="1170787">We submit it should be the former.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.868" offset="1182804">We trust that any inquiry on the question of standing begins, at least some members of this Court would suggest ends with the question of whether there is injury in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.814" offset="1218644">That is a test which at least as I read the cases is the constitutional or Article 3 cases in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.404" offset="1253021">But I don't think that there is a great dispute here over injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.634" offset="1269948">This Court has noted in the numerous recent cases, including most recently Sierra Club against Morton, that their interest be on mere economic ones which merit judicial protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.246" offset="1316342">In Sierra Club, the Court referred to the environmental questions there in issue as an important ingredient of the quality of life in our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.318" offset="1352600">It's language which was also used in a very well reasoned opinion of the Third Circuit, involving Title 8 in part Shannon versus HUD in which the Third Circuit suggested that the persons who neither are going to be displaced nor live-in in a federally low funded housing area would nonetheless have standing to challenge what was obviously going to disintegrate the quality of their neighborhood because of the effect which those practices had upon the quality of their daily life.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.938" offset="1483107">Here, the petitioners submit that being compelled as a result of the defendant's practices to continue to live in Parkmerced under an unlawful condition to segregation constitutes a very real injury to the quality of their daily life, an injury which we submit undeniably merits protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.856" offset="1578820">In an effort to flush out the rather bare bones allegations or complaint, which course must be taken as true in the posture of this case, we submitted in the District Court, and it is part of the record here, an affidavit of Dr. Alvin Poussaint, the Associate Dean of the Harvard Medical School. Dr. Poussaint whose clinical practices have been quite broad in this area, suggests indeed the persons living in an environment such as Parkmerced or any environment that is artificially segregated, suffer real injuries, injuries which may or may not lead to clinical symptoms, injuries which may or may not result in personal damage, even economic damage, but injuries which nonetheless are very (Inaudible)</text>

            <text syncTime="431.040" offset="1827506">We would suggest that there is no right under the constitution or at least none has yet been recognized by this Court, per se, to live in any integrated environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.036" offset="1867525">The only right we're asserting here is the right to live in an environment which is not artificially segregated as the result of practices affirmatively proscribed under Title 8 and 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.901" offset="1923009">Now if your question goes to the issue of whether or not a person in Arkansas might have standing to challenge practice of racial discrimination at Parkmerced, I would suggest no, unless on some set of facts which I cannot hypothesize, he could allege the type of individualized grievance injury which the statue in question were intended to protect.</text>

            <text syncTime="556.790" offset="2330520">The plaintiff's counsel in the two cases are the same as has been pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.342" offset="2352776">The issue that goes beyond the mere question of injury is are these plaintiffs, these petitioners, proper parties to challenge, to seek redress for the injuries that they suffered under Title 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.859" offset="2422784">It may indeed be a concept as we have noted of zone of interest if that test applies. Reviewability of that event test which I understand to be a minority view on this Court as this point applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.674" offset="2470118">It may indeed that for under the generalized language of Article 3 in Flast versus Cohen, it'd be a question of nexus, but however one approaches that, it seems to us and we would submit to the Court that these plaintiffs who have both privity of a state and privity of contract with their landlord and whose terms and conditions of tenancy are unquestionably affected by their unlawful practices are within the contemplation of Title 8 and within the contemplation of 1982 and accordingly have standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.423" offset="2633017">If you recall the language of Title 8, it begins with the explicit declaration that it is the policy of the United States to provide within constitutional limitations for fair housing throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.252" offset="2696338">In terms of standing, it defines a person aggrieved as anyone who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="745.098" offset="3083786">We do have two petitioners here, Mrs. Carr and Mr. Ambery (ph) who are Negroes, but as to the others, we suggest that in terms of a standing inquiry, the inquiry is whether or not a approximate result of practices proscribed by 1982 which you just read, they are directly injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.275" offset="3160482">That was the thrust as we read it of the Court holding in the Sullivan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.631" offset="3181902">It's the thrust also of the District Court's decision which we have decided in the Walker against Pointer.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.905" offset="3203009">White persons can be injured and can therefore have standing under Article 3 as a result of discriminations as in Sullivan, as in Walker as in the other case of Bowers (ph) against Jackson which are not directed against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.486" offset="3273331">It's the injury that they suffered and the interest which they have been redressing that injury which grants standing under 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.413" offset="3317008">In terms of the companion statute, for which we are here, Title 8, the language is even more clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.768" offset="3350444">We are seeking to redress injuries which the petitioners suffered.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.521" offset="3373432">This is the case involving personalized allegation to the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.865" offset="3390882">We claim to have been injured as the result of discriminatory housing practices prescribed by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.069" offset="3423692">Now if we go beyond the language which both ourselves and the office of the Solicitor General would be before the Court in the moment, think it's quite clear in support of our standing, if we go beyond that to the legislative history, we again find I think, although no comment at all as to who should or should not have standing beyond the language of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.171" offset="3508015">We find two principles which I submit militate strongly in favor of the petitioner's standard here.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.668" offset="3530062">The first is the continuing recognition of the fact that racial discrimination is a pernicious evil throughout our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.025" offset="3567470">Senator Mondale who is the principal author of the Bill noted that we must show that we do not intend to live separately in this country, but that we intend to live together, that is what this measure is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.952" offset="3615222">Now the second thing that we derive from the legislative history is the fact that Title 8 was intended to do something about that discrimination, not only at the behest of a Negro individual who's denied housing, is intelligent enough to perceive that he's been denied because of his race and diligent enough to pursue it, but at the behest of a group of tenants as well, as long as they are personally injured by those practices, that's what the statute is all about.</text>

            <text syncTime="1339.316" offset="5460616">This case presents a quite narrow question of statutory construction and answering that question, we believe that this Court can put aside more far reaching problems of standing to litigate constitutional issues or to enforce statutes that do not expressly provide for a right of private action and do not contain a provision conferring standing on a defined class of persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.156" offset="5580048">In the Fair Housing Act of 1968, Congress has specified two methods of private enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.917" offset="5619022">One providing for recourse to the conciliation efforts of the Department of Housing and Urban Development before a suit is brought and the other authorizing direct action in the courts, and the Act's standing provision which is reproduced on page two of our brief is in the words of the Court of Appeals very broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.242" offset="5712332">Certainly, the language is broad enough to cover the petitioners here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2004.478" offset="8121240">HUD has been receiving 2,500 complaints a year under this statute; none of the complainants are in this category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.327" offset="8152691">They are not likely to have the requisite information to make such a complaint and it's much more likely that the real injury that would motivate a complaint, would be filed by someone more directly associated with the complex where the discrimination was occurring, whether it's an apartment development or a development of tracked homes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2055.777" offset="8326457">We do have one footnote which indicates that we think that the Negro petitioners seem to come within the terms of 1982, to the extent that they are complaining that they are victims of tokenism in living in this large development where their race is discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.945" offset="8423111">They are not being permitted to lease on the same terms as white persons in that sense, and we have suggested that that seems to fit the language of 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.938" offset="8467101">Of course, our principle concern is with our responsibilities for administering Title 8 and with the complaints that HUD has been entertaining and that the holding of the court below seems to imply HUD is not empowered to entertain the process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2116.029" offset="8567515">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.519" offset="8585488">We have here under consideration today what I believe is an extremely practical problem rather than an emotional problem that has been presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.203" offset="8624149">Neither of the defendants would deny that segregation or discrimination is a pervasive evil, but that is not the question presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.050" offset="8659571">As I indicate, we have nothing but a practical problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.222" offset="8672214">Is this Court going to authorize tenants of an apartment complex, incumbent tenants to sue their landlord for injuries which they allege arise out of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 and the Civil Rights Act of 1866?</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.545" offset="8745566">This Court has never gone that far before and I submit should not in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.630" offset="8765942">It will submitted that the decision of the Ninth Circuit was absolutely correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.504" offset="8785377">I believe preliminarily before considering the question of standing, we should put the interest of the United States in focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.947" offset="8819127">The contentions of the United States tracked and parallel almost exactly that of the petitioners, but I believe that their motivation for joining with the petitioners is different and I believe that's reflected in their briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.742" offset="8878373">Their briefs assert they have a very small Civil Rights staff and an even smaller housing staff and therefore, they need whatever help they can get from the private sector and that is certainly understandable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.310" offset="8928632">If they do have -- indeed have a small staff and are over worked, they should have assistance of the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.472" offset="8953292">However, we submit that denial of standing to these plaintiffs is not going to detract one bit from the enforcement or from the assistance legitimately available to the United States in this type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.048" offset="9023613">There is a complete arsenal of Federal authority provided by Title 8 which is applicable to this kind of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.351" offset="9052766">The implementation of national policy in providing fair housing will not be affected at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.133" offset="9083904">As partial proof of this, I refer to the case that Justice Blackmun, Mr. Justice Blackmun referred to and that is Burbridge versus Parkmerced Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.000" offset="9123401">While as that case might not be a blood brother to this case, it's certainly a first cousin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.388" offset="9148897">It was filed just 15 days after the District Court dismissed this case for lack of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.837" offset="9174706">It was filed by the same attorneys as they are representing the plaintiffs here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.634" offset="9193932">It has virtually identical allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.986" offset="9207306">Whenever we appear in the District Court, the plaintiffs in this case are there to observe and it would be folly to assume that they are not, in fact, related.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.357" offset="9248789">In each of those cases, in that case rather, the plaintiffs are five Negroes, one married couple and three other individuals, each of whom claims to have been a direct victim of a discriminatory housing practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.424" offset="9317021">That they applied for apartments and that for some reason or other they were refused.</text>

            <text syncTime="2312.936" offset="9355160">We did not challenge their standing in the Lower Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.675" offset="9366026">We are proceeding with that case, discovery proceedings are pending and in fact, the trial date has been set.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.689" offset="9390164">The trial date is April 29, I believe it is, with certain pre-trial dates in the intervention and so that case will be disposed off shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.160" offset="9424018">In addition, it purports to be a class action and while it has not qualified as such as yet under Rule 23, it is proceeding in that context and it is anticipated that in due course a motion to qualify it as a class action will be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.004" offset="9499355">I like the Court to keep in mind what the plaintiffs have asked this Court to do and what they have asked the District Court to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.109" offset="9531852">In their prayer for relief, they asked the Court to fashion a decree, an adjunctive decree which would be virtually binding on no one except perhaps the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.183" offset="9580126">This distinct possibility occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.219" offset="9588276">Keep in mind that this action is not a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.268" offset="9600397">This is an action by individuals and individuals alone who sue in their own right and in their own right alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.128" offset="9627878">And if I might state at this point parenthetically because I think it's important in response to the petitioners' contention that somehow incumbent tenants are the ones that should assert the rights under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.421" offset="9677093">I will advise the Court at this time that there were six plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.530" offset="9693497">There were two plaintiffs that filed the suit and there were four individual plaintiffs in intervention together with an unidentified committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.249" offset="9724322">The four individual plaintiffs have since long departed, Parkmerced, have moved their tenancy, demonstrating the transiency of tenancies and I can -- fail to see what state they would have in the outcome of this controversy at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.687" offset="9782105">While we haven't raised it, it might well be moot as to those four tenants who no longer live there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.714" offset="9802271">One of them, as a matter of fact, has moved as far as Rio de Janeiro.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.529" offset="9825468">They would left the personal stake in the outcome of the controversy which this Court has required in its decision in Baker versus Carr.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.742" offset="9866324">If however, getting to trial on a case such as this, the defendants won, that is if the defendant landlord won the case, it certainly wouldn't be binding upon the next individual who would come along and assert his personal value preference of phrase used by this Court, most recently in Sierra Club versus Morton.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.898" offset="9950960">Whether his grievance would be real or imagined, he'd have the right to assert it because there would be no res judicata effect to a decision such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.487" offset="9985337">If on the other hand, the plaintiffs were granted any measure of relief, it certainly wouldn't be binding upon the next group of plaintiffs who wanted to come in and assert what they thought was the proper racial mix of Parkmerced or any complex and it's with that background, Your Honor, that we proceed to the question of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.989" offset="10051375">We just do not feel that Congress ever envisioned that kind of profound disorder in creating certain rights and remedies in the housing field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.261" offset="10112397">As we have indicated, now I think as both sides concede the standing issue in this case is not at all complex, in fact, it's quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.325" offset="10140714">The length of the briefs and the plethora of cases that have been cited on this subject demonstrate in my judgment one thing and that is the futility of attempting to assign to a statute a task or a burden that it was never meant to carry and I think that is the thrust of the petitioners' position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.440" offset="10213125">They are trying to derive from Title 8 standing where none was ever intended and the statute simply won't carry it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.611" offset="10249801">Stripped to its essentials, the issue is simply this; did Congress intend that plaintiffs such as this, that is incumbent tenants have standing to complain of the policies of their landlord and we submit that it clearly did not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2818.525" offset="11377455">That is not one of the rights, that is protected by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.705" offset="11398144">They alleged that their injuries are social and professional in that they are deprived of the right to benefit from association with different races, but the complaints are silent on these points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.950" offset="11467212">There is no allegation in any complaint that Parkmerced, Metropolitan Life or the present owner, Parkmerced Corporation has a gate at the door and blocks any business or social visitor to these plaintiffs from entering his apartment or coming to visit him or from associating with him in anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.633" offset="11541922">The complaint is devoid of any such allegations and the challenge that they are denied interracial association simply fails.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.858" offset="11578807">The streets of Parkmerced are public, although the development is private. Anybody that wants to come there can come at anytime and visit any tenant in any apartment that as long as he is, of course, invited by the tenant himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.823" offset="11638680">So there is absolutely no interference with free interracial association nor is there any allegation to that effect in the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="3563.591" offset="14357713">So, presumably under a statute which has a relatively short statute of limitations and which is cast in terms of specific discriminatory housing practices, in order to prevail these plaintiffs, although their complaint contains no specific allegation of a specific wrongful conduct, will have to prove that Mr. A came to the premises, made an application and was wrongfully excluded and B and C, none of those people is present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.860" offset="14482787">Moreover, may I point out to the Court that under Section 3604 of the statute in describing a violation and refusal to rent, the statute specifically requires a finding as to the bona fide, the good faith of the applicant for an apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.219" offset="14560214">Well, it seems particularly inappropriate that plaintiffs who are not themselves in the excluded group should be permitted or even called upon to litigate the good faith of those not represented nor bound by the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.892" offset="14626983">Indeed, the decision to that extent lack finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.177" offset="14656031">There was a question from the Court --</text>

            <text syncTime="3665.469" offset="14765223">Indeed, and I am paraphrasing the statutory language, if he reasonably believes that there has been a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.192" offset="14808168">Now, a private plaintiff who phrased a compliant in precisely those terms would necessarily not be entitled to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.125" offset="14839829">The private action rights and remedies under the statute are limited to those brought within 180 days of the specific discriminatory housing practice complaint off and otherwise, limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.363" offset="14888835">We do not contend as our brief makes clear that an appropriate private plaintiff who complies with the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil procedure, may not maintain a class action and represent broad and obtain broad relief, but that's not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.542" offset="14965530">There was a question from the bench as to the power of Congress to enact legislation which might provide plaintiffs in petitioners' position of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.110" offset="15007848">I believe that there is no question that could be done and would call the Court's attention to the provisions of the 1964 Public Accommodations Civil Rights Act which in its terms provides that citizens are entitled to public accommodations which are free of segregation and discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.654" offset="15093948">There is no question that a plaintiff, any citizen who encounters a condition of segregation or discrimination can sue under that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.839" offset="15130728">I might note that the Act also limits the remedy to injunctive relief without damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.261" offset="15156433">Now, in the 1968 Civil Rights Act here at issue, there is no comfortable language and the remedy is afforded to the private plaintiff include damages, penalty damages as well as the right to recover attorney's fees in appropriate instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.445" offset="15221112">Turning to the main thrust of my talk today, Parkmerced Corporation purchased the properties after, some months after the complaints at issue here were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.201" offset="15268133">Parkmerced Corporation is a special purpose corporation created for purposes of acquiring the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.417" offset="15293001">It had no connection with the alleged acts of housing discrimination attributed to Metropolitan and it was joined after the suit was commenced under Federal Rule 25 as a party defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3834.649" offset="15442004">There is no record other than the complaint and ancillary papers, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3838.823" offset="15458617">I can assure the Court that while there may have been some changes, I do not think the Court is justified in assuming there is a materially different complex of tenants within Parkmerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.951" offset="15531133">Now as to the success and interest of the position, I should point out that under familiar concepts of law, ordinarily, a private entity is not liable for the conduct of another unless it somehow has contributed to, conspired in or otherwise become involved in the conduct itself which is a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.648" offset="15605948">None of these factors applies to the case of Parkmerced Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3881.520" offset="15629458">As to the pleadings in the case, the pleadings simply assert that Parkmerced Corporation had notice of the charges at the time it bought and secondly, upon information and belief that Parkmerced Corporation in the two weeks which has elapsed from December 21, 1970 when it purchased the property and January 5, 1971 when an amended complaint stating a cause of action against Parkmerced Corporation was filed, in that two-week period, that they have not made substantial changes in the operations of Parkmerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3916.752" offset="15770415">Thirdly, upon information and belief the assertion is made that Parkmerced intends to continue the employees and their real estate office and not to make changes in policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.799" offset="15818585">Now the later allegations incidentally are by -- in terms of the complaint itself based upon public information, typed letters sent to tenants advising them of the transfer which in effect said, “We've been happy to have you and we will continue with operations as before.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.210" offset="15900191">In their briefs, the petitioners attempt to maintain the position that Metropolitan and Parkmerced Corporation, notwithstanding the complete separation of interest between them which we have made explicit in our briefs, are somehow involved in a joint venture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3966.389" offset="15968946">This is wholly inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3968.892" offset="15978977">First of all Metropolitan provided mortgage financing and has committed to provide additional mortgage financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.772" offset="16006457">These obligations are represented in a mortgage in a side letter agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.962" offset="16027251">Indeed the letter agreement itself is so detailed as to belie any suggestion that the lender, Metropolitan was in anyway involved in the future operating decisions which would result in mortgage liability, additional lending by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.280" offset="16088482">Finally, there is an assertion that Metropolitan has -- in the petitioners' brief that Metropolitan has retained the power to appoint a property manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.325" offset="16124635">This is simply not correct, Metropolitan as a mortgage lender and as lessor under the ground lease which is here at issue, has the power for cause only to require that Parkmerced give up the management of the premises and in such case, upon indeed a failure of Parkmerced property to manage the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.797" offset="16222542">Parkmerced would select from a list provided by Metropolitan, the new manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="4034.789" offset="16242500">It simply is not a reservation of control in Metropolitan.</text>
