            <text syncTime="1508.906" offset="6138964">My brief and that of my colleague Mr. Cramer is on behalf of those whom we referred to as legislative respondents, the members of Congress, the Committee members and their aides, the Committee staff who were named as defendants, the Public Printer and Superintendent of Documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.459" offset="6205210">This case involves an attempt by petitioners to selectively sensor by injunction a document of the Congress a Committee Report which was ordered printed pursuant to the rules of the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.243" offset="6264351">The petitioners also seek damages against the respondents for their failure to delete the names from the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.453" offset="6297161">A House Resolution which is printed at page 5 of our brief authorized the Committee on the District of Columbia to conduct the full investigation and study of any instrumentality of the District of Columbia Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.429" offset="6361109">The resolution also empowered the Committee to require by subpoena or otherwise the production of documents as it deems necessary as further directed, the Committee to report to the House the results of its investigation and its findings and recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.929" offset="6439058">The report in question issued after seven months of investigations 14 hearings, all of which concerned in the District of Columbia school system and the report contained 36 specific findings and 27 recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.233" offset="6504260">It’s our position that the opinions of the Court in Gravel and then Brewster and all of the dissents in those cases, Cowles as a unanimous holding that the legislative respondents, all of them, are immune from questioning in any other place on account of the matters complained.</text>

            <text syncTime="1743.558" offset="7077595">Applying this test you have to analyze the nature of the acts performed by the members and by their staff to determine whether they are protected acts, first, the members of the House.</text>

            <text syncTime="1821.218" offset="7388244">Turning again to the allegations of the complaint reproduced on page 9 of the appendix it’s alleged that Seville who was a Junior High School Principal gave the investigator the copies of disciplinary letters and other materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.346" offset="7452714">It’s alleged that Irvine who was a teacher gave the investigator copies of attendance list, school test papers, and other materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.687" offset="7486151">So we have an investigator for our committee and he’s alleged to such in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.052" offset="7507571">The Committee was authorized to inquire into the D.C. school system and further authorize to obtain documents by subpoena or otherwise if this investigator was given and that the words in the complainant given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.302" offset="7564622">He was given school documents by school officials and petitioners now characterized the obtention of these documents as clandestine and surreptitious in attempt to avoid the holding in Gravel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.468" offset="7633272">But they don’t really challenged the Committee’s right to interview school officials and obtain school records from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.959" offset="7663156">In the Court below the majority opinion at page 75 of the appendix state that petitioners quote, “do not challenge the propriety of the investigation or the issuance of the report generally – i.e. absently use of their names - nor could they” and the dissenting opinion below page at 104 of the appendix stated that “indeed, they the petitioners do not even challenge the right of Congress to examine and summarize the confidential material involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.993" offset="7795336">They only wish to retain their anonymity, thus we have a Committee aide receiving relevant documents in a most routine way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.525" offset="7853432">We submit this as an enterable and legitimate part of the preparation for a legislative act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.566" offset="7877674">The graveling of the petitioners complaint against the aides and the Congressman too for that fact really boils down to the failure of the Committee in the House of the Representatives to delete their names from the documents included in the official report and the Speech or Debate Clause affords complete immunity to the congressman and in this context their aides with respect to the Committee report itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.852" offset="7998777">As the opinion in Gravel says at page 17 slip opinion, a member’s conduct at legislative committee hearings may not be made the basis for a civil or criminal judgment against a member because that conduct is within the sphere of legitimate legislative activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.678" offset="8074115">As this Court said in Katz v. United States 399 US at 350 in footnote 5 virtually every governmental action interferes with privacy to some degree.</text>

            <text syncTime="2804.128" offset="11319881">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.900" offset="11334928">Let me first put in focus as I see it Speech and Debate as compared to separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.402" offset="11360946">Speech and Debate is a part of separation of powers and most specifically stated in U.S. v. Johnson “the Speech and Debate Clause serves a function of reinforcing the Speech and Debate powers to deliberately establish by the founding fathers therefore separation of powers is emphasized and it is reinforced by the Speech and Debate Clause and not limited by.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.983" offset="11459271">Then let me get it in, in view of the questions that had been asked and I would suggest, I would be most helpful to the Court the questions, some of the questions raise with regards to perhaps in spreading the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.433" offset="11509112">Once a Committee report properly printed by the Congress ordered by the Congress to be printed pursuant to a resolution of the Congress and unquestionably pursuant to the power of Congress because here we are dealing with the Congress as the sole legislator and sole governor of under the Constitution Article I Section 8 of the District of Columbia, and in those instances there is no question with what the Committee report itself is beyond question by this Court and by anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.545" offset="11633560">It is a legislative act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.948" offset="11643173">Being a legislative act, it is beyond the province of this Court as it would be of the Executive to inquire into the motives of the members why they put in the information in that is the decision by the duly elected representative how he makes a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.307" offset="11704613">He is answerable to his constituents and that’s apparently in the House you are answerable every two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.801" offset="11726555">That is a pretty tough test and that is a good assurance to the public that their discretion is going to be properly exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.668" offset="11754036">Now, as to the distribution of the papers, this is a report it is in the public domain and that Congress has a duty in representing the people, has a duty to inform the people otherwise how can the people can judge whether the legislator is doing a proper job, that Congress is properly representing him properly legislating for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.872" offset="11854869">So that Congress has a duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.550" offset="11861556">How else can the people determine what additional laws are needed and after all that Congressman is a representative of the people and, what we’re talking about here and what consumes me about some of the questions and some of the cases that I’ve read is that it appears that there’s an effort as my colleague has said balance, to balance what?</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.606" offset="11949746">You cannot balance an individual’s constitutional right in the context of the duty of all of the Congress to legislate and the cases have clearly pointed this out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.970" offset="12003244">Let me refer for instance the Methodist case which is a Circuit Court of Appeals by judge adjutant as Chief Judge, very find judge in which the court specifically said, “that the power to declare unconstitutional” and I think this is what causes a lot of the problems in the thinking of the judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.679" offset="12078059">Prior to the declare law unconstitutional does not support the conclusion that they the court may sensor language that they think is libelous and I say to this Court this is precisely what the petitioners in this case are requesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.590" offset="12145768">I say further that to accept their position would say would in effect say that this Court should balance the constitutional legislative powers in its broad sense not against one member as compared to a complaining U.S. citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.799" offset="12214523">We’re talking about the broad sense when you are talking about the speech on the floor of the House, when you are talking about the contents of the document, when you are talking about an effort as these complainants are attempting to impose an effort to sensor because they’re asking them that you weigh the constitutional legislative mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.168" offset="12292054">As a matter of fact, that comes almost within the doctrine of the major case recently decided relating to Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.785" offset="12326536">The Constitutional mandate for Congress is to legislate and is a separation of past question when it is exercised and within the legislative act come at Once that’s determined there is no further question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3332.782" offset="13434546">I represent the District of Columbia respondents consisting of the members of the Board of Education, the Superintendent of schools, a Junior High School Principal, and a Junior High School Teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.497" offset="13485328">Our position is that simply stated that that the doctorate official immunity as interpreted and applied by this Court and Barr versus Matteo and Howard versus Lyons, and companion case forecloses the liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.302" offset="13536632">We like to take these respondents individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.870" offset="13550843">First, we’d like to take the Board members and the Superintendent of schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.399" offset="13568920">The gravamen of petition in this case as to these respondents is that they should respond to damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.561" offset="13593579">The failures would promulgate regulations governing the confidentiality of school documents really and they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.226" offset="13620328">We respectfully submit to this Court that this is of course our legislative function to top level function is clearly within the framework of Barr versus Matteo and it is not remediable in damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.257" offset="13668394">The teacher and the principal perhaps taken on a different light, in regard to their liability or alleged liability we emphasize at the very outset that unlike the Barr versus Matteo case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.887" offset="13718967">This case in the context of the principal and teacher involves an intergovernmental dissemination or communication, a communication within the framework of the Government itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.223" offset="13764315">Let me illustrate that with the comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.334" offset="13772675">Let’s assume that instead of giving this directly to congressional committee, the principal and teacher gave the data to the School Board and the School Board in turn published it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.107" offset="13811754">Perhaps there might be an action to damages against the School Board but not against the principal and teacher for giving the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.382" offset="13836936">We submit that Congress, vis-à-vis the District of Columbia school system may be fairly viewed as a supervisory or senior school board, and as a kind of employer, it has plenary power to investigate the school system that controls its purse strings, it certainly may be analogize with the top level employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.402" offset="13920946">It is within the periphery then of an employer-employee relationship that this information was tended with some of its absolutely privileged even applying the standards articulated by then Chief Justice Warren in his dissenting opinion in Barr versus Matteo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.475" offset="13985311">And we also emphasized that petitioners do not question the right of these officials to give the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.477" offset="14021256">Well its officials we would refer the Court to pages 35 and 37 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.050" offset="14039542">I am not going to quote chapter and verse but they emphasized that the trial court, we don’t question the right of Congress to get this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.994" offset="14071306">We don’t question the right of teachers to give it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.451" offset="14085204">As petitioners said almost rebellion, they can’t go into schools; they can’t talk to people as they did.</text>

            <text syncTime="3752.771" offset="15114428">We would also have the size and even assuming the Civil Rights Act does apply in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.728" offset="15138252">Then the question would be prior to dimensions of the immunity doctrine under that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.832" offset="15154657">Now this Court has not yet articulated the dimensions but lower federal courts have and we can take standards articulated by lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.774" offset="15186422">We can weigh competing interests certainly and we can come up with an equitable result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.521" offset="15201468">Now, it seems that, in one of the spectrum you have the right of the Congress to receive information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.220" offset="15220276">If there are another spectrum you have the right to privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.993" offset="15231352">But the right of privacy is alleged to have been violated here, not in the context of the right of Congress to receive information but in the context of publication of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.341" offset="15272730">So here again, it’s a question of complete good faith as conceded by the petitioners and though the federal courts do hold that if this good faith the Civil Rights Act of 1871 does not alter the immunity of the Government, and we submit that that is fairly applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.821" offset="15350680">Well, another analogy that I would like to make it seems that there was a companion case to Barr versus Matteo and that was called Howard versus Lyons, that companion case involves the Commander of a Boston Naval Shipyard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.864" offset="15406791">It so happen that the commander of the shipyard made a press release, gathered information to congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3831.750" offset="15430405">The information was not requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3833.643" offset="15437928">It was delivered unsolicitedly by the Shipyard Commander and who it was given up to a congressional committee but to the Massachusetts congressional delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.999" offset="15479411">We submit that that case would indicate that the rules of the immunity doctrines as a fortiori applicable here for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3851.808" offset="15510653">First of all, the principal may fairly be analogized as we say it to the commander of shipyard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.874" offset="15534895">He has extensive duties within the periphery of the school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.171" offset="15556106">Secondly, and we emphasize this, we don’t have an unsolicited inquiry or unsolicited response to a congressional delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.754" offset="15602395">We have a solicited response by a Committee of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.157" offset="15640012">That leaves only to teacher, as we see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3887.168" offset="15652028">Now, the teacher we don’t find analogies with any prior decision of this Court we admit, neither with the Barr decision nor the Howard decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.215" offset="15684211">But it’s not without significance, it seems Barr was decided and before Barr was decided, many lower federal courts have applied the immunity doctrine to (Inaudible) line officials comparable a nature of position to the teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.506" offset="15741367">Personnel officers, game wardens, treasury agents, we submit that those authorities well, obviously not a binding on this Court are persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3918.325" offset="15776684">So in all respects, we submit that the Court should apply the doctrine of official immunity to the District of Columbia respondents in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4155.136" offset="16723884">I’m sorry if there’s been some confusion on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4158.082" offset="16735692">But I -- and what’s more even if there had been that kind of that of a concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="4162.729" offset="16754291">We submit that the procedures in the District Court were highly irregular.</text>
            <text syncTime="4167.689" offset="16774144">We went to Court at 04:30, the day the complaint was filed on our motion for at temporary restraining order to be met by a sua sponte dismissal on the merits with the judge asserting he thought it was frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="4181.953" offset="16831195">We had no idea, we were to defend a motion to dismiss or summary judgment that no one had made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4189.160" offset="16860035">And even if there may have been a concession, we don’t think that it is a real concession but there was no concession on this teacher and principal giving the documents and I think you may have to read the transcript of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4206.540" offset="16929520">Another point is that, we submit that as to the District Court of Columbia respondents, Congress is not the ultimate superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.240" offset="16960345">The law is the ultimate superior of public officials and because of the peculiar relationship in this city between public officials and the House District Committee, it is tempting to say that the House Committee is the Government but it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4232.453" offset="17033174">The real Government in this city is the law and teachers, principals, Boards of Education, Congressman’s staff and investigators have to comply with the law and that is the ultimate superior and that is why we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4247.355" offset="17092838">We think that the processes of the law and that the protections of the Constitution and the protections of a Civil Rights Act now a 101 years old provide us with the remedy and that an injunction is possible if only the courthouse doors will open.</text>
            <text syncTime="4263.552" offset="17157622">They’ve been close to us this is the last Court we can go to.</text>
