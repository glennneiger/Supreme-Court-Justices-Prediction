            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- this morning in a series of related cases which I'll indicate only by number, 72-395, 72-414, 72-528, 555 and 666.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.369" offset="200808">Mr. Freedman, you may proceed.</text>

          <turn speaker="freedman" startTime="26.875" stopTime="361.283">
            <label>Mr. Freedman</label>
            <text syncTime="26.875" offset="210840">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.558" offset="225573">These five consolidated cases present important questions under the 1962 amendments to the Federal Food, Drug &amp; Cosmetic law.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.126" offset="271862">Under the predecessor statute, the Food and Drug Administration in granting pre-marketing clearance to new drugs is limited to considering the safety of those drugs, that's it views, whether the drug was safe, and the major change made in the 1962 amendment, insofar as these cases are concerned, is that this pre-marketing clearance was extended to cover the effectiveness of drugs as well as their safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.967" offset="399235">And these cases present before the Court the questions of the standards under the statute and the procedures by which the Food and Drug Administration is to determine the effectiveness of the large number of drugs now on the market, and thereby to protect the public against the distribution in interstate commerce of ineffective drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.009" offset="495365">The statutory provisions are quite detailed and complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.618" offset="513860">And in order to put the issues in a proper perspective and indicate the interrelationship among the issues in the cases, before discussing the particular cases, I would like to make a rather generalized statement that is applicable to all of the cases, in which I'll first describe the background and history of the statute, then deal with its particular provisions, and finally explain the administrative statute that the Food and Drug Administration has taken to implement the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.791" offset="634546">After this opening statement, which according to my best estimate should take around 20 minutes, the cases will then be argued in three separate segments.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.750" offset="674356">The first segment will consist of the Bentex and CIBA cases, which I will argue for the government, and in each segment, the case will be viewed as a separate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.647" offset="717928">That is, the opening argument will be made by the government in the first two, and by respondents, petitioners' counsel, the Drug Company in the third, then there will be an answering argument, and this in turn will be followed by rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.581" offset="769651">So if the Court will have in the way of an oral presentation, as an opening statement applicable to all of the cases followed in effect by three separate consecutive arguments, in which as I think it will develop the issues are somewhat interrelated.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.332" offset="832658">Now the starting point in the analysis of the statute is the 1906 Food &amp; Drug Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.023" offset="863483">Now that Act prohibited to the distribution and interstate commerce of adulterated and misbranded drugs, but the Act had no provision for pre-marketing clearance of the drugs by any administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.463" offset="921266">The only sanctions under that Act were proceeding to forfeit the misbranded or adulterated drugs and criminal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.862" offset="958777">In 1938, as the result of a tragic accident in which a number of people died, as a result of taking a drug that had not been tested and proved to be unsafe, Congress passed the Federal Food Drug &amp; Cosmetic Act, which for the first time provided for pre-marketing clearance of drugs, before the drugs could be distributed in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.986" offset="1067342">The statute prohibited the introduction of any new drug, unless there was in effect an application that had been filed with and permitted to become effective by the Secretary of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.731" offset="1126275">These applications for the marketing of new drugs are known in the industry as NDA’s, New Drug Applications, and both the government and the counsel for respondents will use that term to describe them.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.637" offset="1189909">The statute also provided that after notice and opportunity for hearing, the Secretary could deny any application for new drug approval if he found either that the drug was not safe or that he was unable to find that it was safe, and finally, it permitted the suspension of an approved New Drug Application if subsequent evidence developed to show that the drug was unsafe.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.510" offset="1305370">The 1938 statute also substantially expanded the enforcement authority of the Food and Drug Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.257" offset="1340374">It gave the administrate, correction, the Secretary of Agriculture; the statute in terms delegates the powers to the Secretary of Agriculture and that was transferred to the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, but he has delegated virtually all of his powers under the statute to the Food and Drug Administration, and I would use the term Secretary and Food and Drug Administration interchangeably.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.662" offset="1442043">It -- the statute authorized the Secretary to promulgate regulations for the efficient enforcement of the Act, gave the agency authority to conduct investigations, and finally expanded the District Court authority to include suits for injunction in addition to forfeiture in criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.629" offset="1533889">Now the processing of these New Drug Applications is a --</text>

            <text syncTime="361.283" offset="1548518">Mr. Freedman, before you go into that, prior to the 1962 amendment, if you will tell me again, what was the mechanism, the enforcement mechanism, was it only a cease-and-desist order --</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="freedman" startTime="379.774" stopTime="489.048">
            <label>Mr. Freedman</label>
            <text syncTime="379.774" offset="1622497">No, in addition to that, in addition to that under the 19 -- before the 1962 Act, the Secretary had authority to deny approval to a New Drug Application if he either found that the New Drug Application, that the drug was not safe, or that they had failed to find it was safe, and in addition to that, he had the authority to withdraw approval after notice and opportunity for hearing, if subsequent developments after the NDA had become effective, indicated the drug was not safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.363" offset="1752795">Then in addition to that if there were the ancillaries, we believe the ancillary remedies of proceedings in the District Court under which -- under the 1938 Act, prior to the 1938 Act, they could only proceed under -- through criminal proceedings or forfeiture, but the 1938 Act expanded this to give Food and Drug, the government the authority to seek injunctive relief in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.840" offset="1866689">But as a practical matter, as a practical matter because of the nature of drugs and public concern, it's a rare instance in which a drug manufacturer would attempt to market a drug, if the Food and Drug Administration concluded that it could not permit the New Drug Application to become effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.448" offset="1937115">In other words, our basic position here is that the primary enforcement method that Congress selected in the 1938 Act, and increased and improved, and the 1962 Act was the administrative procedure of pre-drug marketing, pre-marketing clearance for drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.898" offset="2014960">That is, that the agency would stand at the gateway before the drugs could get into the channels of interstate commerce, and say, whether or not they would permit these drugs to be distributed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Freedman</label>
            <text syncTime="494.858" offset="2082774">Yes, I will come to that in one or two minutes Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.249" offset="2100328">After just making this one point that the processing of these New Drug Applications is an extremely time consuming and difficult task, they are huge things; they are filled with a mountain of scientific information.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.085" offset="2159679">They may have statements from as many as several hundred doctors giving their views on these drugs, they are papers, they are lengthy analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.163" offset="2187995">I am told that they are sometimes occupy as much as several hundred volumes.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.024" offset="2203460">They may fill half of a room, and obviously, it would have been an enormous task for Food and Drug just to process these applications as they were filed, and I would mention that in the period between the 1938 Act, and 1962 Act, Food and Drug processed and permitted to become effective almost 10,000 of these applications, and at the time the 1962 Act was passed, it was estimated there were approximately 4,000 of these applications covering drugs that were then being distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.553" offset="2341595">Now the fact of life in the drug industry is that there are a large number of drugs on the market, which are basically the same generic drug, but with various chemical differences, that they are fundamentally the same, but they have slight variations.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.472" offset="2417246">Most of these drugs would come on the market after a New Drug Application had become effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.109" offset="2439816">What would happen is one or two New Drug Applications would come on the market, the drug would be in use for two or three years, and it turned out to be safe, and of course, under the 1938 Act, safety was the sole criteria for passing on New Drug Applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.323" offset="2504704">And following this, a large number of other pharmaceutical firms would put on the market, sell their products for normally labeled, label goes of course to the doctor, we are not talking of a label on the package of packed medicine, this is the label that tells the doctor what the drug will do, label, basically making the same or very similar claims to those in the drugs whether the new drug applications were outstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.158" offset="2615986">Since under the 1938 statute, the test of a new drug was whether the drug was safe, and since by definition, after these New Drug Applications had been determined to be safe, the so called 'me-too' drugs which is what the industry calls the drugs that a pattern after the NDA drugs, but for which no NDA is in effect, they came to be recognized as not new drugs or old drugs, and they came on the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.691" offset="2746180">The estimates are that in the prescription drug field, there is anywhere from 5 to 13 'me-toos' for every drug with respect to which an NDA is outstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.447" offset="2793200">So that by 1962 when the amendments were passed, the best estimate is that there were probably 30,000 to 50,000 drugs outstanding in the 'me-too' category, and that is just in the prescription drug field.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.641" offset="2849938">In addition to the old accounted drug field has vastly greater number.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.809" offset="2866657">It's impossible to know, but the best estimate of Food and Drug would probably, there were 200,000 drugs in all over-the-counter market.</text>

            <text syncTime="1269.247" offset="5180374">Two other things that the statute did in the way of strengthening the administrative authority of the Food and Drug Authority; first under the predecessor statute in 1938, a drug new application became effective automatically, unless the secretary affirmatively disapproved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.007" offset="5263444">This was changed in the 1962 Act, to provide that the application did not become effective unless the Secretary affirmatively approved it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1322.619" offset="5393847">Finally, there is in the statute a "grandfather" clause, which I will not go into, because that will be discussed in some of the succeeding cases, under which certain drugs that were being distributed on the effective date of the statute are exempt from the effectiveness requirements as could be expected as a shortest agreement between the government and the companies as to the meaning of that exemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="1389.564" offset="5661654">So what it did was, it called upon a group of eminent scientists, the National Academy Sciences and it's constituent National Research Council, for aid in determining the validity of the effectiveness claims of this large number of drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.315" offset="5728632">And what the National Academy of Sciences did was, it set up panels; 30 panels, each panel containing 6 experts with respect to the particular type of drug involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.506" offset="5777429">The companies were requested to submit all evidence they had concerning the effectiveness of their drugs as claimed to these panels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.494" offset="5813373">The panels then evaluated each of these drugs, and made recommendations to Food and Drug with respect to their effectiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.298" offset="5848586">They evaluated the drugs, and what happened was as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.392" offset="5868962">These panels found all of these drugs, these 4000 NDAs that were reviewed, 7% were ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.553" offset="5897592">A considerable number were described as effective, and the balance was somewhere in between, they described, and it was possibly effective, probably effective, effective, but effective with respect to some claims and not all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.174" offset="5952031">Many of the labels of course suggested the drug was suitable for more than one condition, and of the 4000 NDAs, there were approximately 16,000 claims, and the National Academy of Science panels found that only 19% of these alleged claims of effectiveness were valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.952" offset="6039176">After these studies were made the Food and Drug Administration had a large conference with the industry in the January of 1968, and it announced that it's policy would be to apply the conclusions of the National Academy of Sciences to all drugs, not only to the drugs that were covered by the NDAs, but also by the 'me-too' drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.053" offset="6143561">And what they announced, they said that they would do, is they would issue notices and opportunity for hearing, whether as to all of the NDA manufacturers whose drugs were found ineffective, and that they would permit the 'me-toos' to come in to those hearings to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.102" offset="6223809">Following -- the best estimate was that as a result of these procedures, they would have to conduct something like a thousand hearings, and in 1969, in the hope of making this problem manageable, they issued further regulations in which they defined what would constitute an adequate and well controlled study, and very specifically they told exactly what it had to be, and they also said that if a manufacturer requested a hearing, they would not grant a hearing unless he produced as indicated as the substantial evidence that he would produce, that type of evidence, that is the well controlled studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.820" offset="6386604">The validity of this regulation is at issue in another one of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.891" offset="6406980">And then finally in 1972, the Food and Drug Administration issued another regulation which more specifically put the 'me-toos' on notice, that the withdrawal of the NDA for the so called the "pioneer" drugs would also apply to the 'me-too' drugs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1611.793" offset="6550549">There is a specific general authority to promulgate rules and regulations, Section 701 and it's a very broad statute, it authorizes them to promulgate rules and regulations necessary for the effective implementation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.241" offset="6620348">There is no specific provision giving the Commissioner authority to define further, what constitutes "substantial evidence," but we believe that as a general exercise in administrative authority this broad rule making power does permit him further to define and particularize the standard of "substantial evidence," which Congress provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.692" offset="6710105">He is not changing it, he is merely explaining what is meant by well conducted clinical studies and investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.541" offset="6745527">Now we think that this legislative history that I have given, privatizes and brings home three things, which I just like to reiterate now, because I think they are critical to the legal issues in the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.401" offset="6813027">First, by the 1962 amendments, Congress intended to take off the market, to take off the market drugs that had not been shown to be effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.346" offset="6860779">And Congress decided to do this primarily by expanding the authority of the Food and Drug Administration, it's pre-marketing clearance authority to cover effectiveness as well as safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.307" offset="6908635">It required that the definition of whether a drug be effective, be put in terms of high probative scientific studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.764" offset="6954402">Secondly, as I think I have indicated, Food and Drug was faced with this enormous administrative problem and it couldn't possibly deal with the situation on the basis of a drug-by-drug procedure, of bringing 4000 separate proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.125" offset="7011871">It had to deal with it on a more comprehensive basis and finally, we think the method it has selected, the use of the National Academy, with it's panels of experts, the opportunity given to the manufacturers to come in after the scientific studies have been made and to show why in effect, in fact, their drugs were effective in accordance with their claims under principles of adequate and well controlled clinical investigations, it was a reasonable and fair method of dealing with the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.810" offset="7146663">And with this as the background, I now would like to turn to the two cases I am going to argue, the Bentex case, which is here on Certiorari to the Fourth Circuit and the CIBA case which is here on Certiorari to the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.963" offset="7195251">The question in each of these cases, is whether the Food an Drug Administration has jurisdiction to determine, whether a product is a new drug to which the pre-marketing clearance procedures and the withdrawal procedures of Section 505 of the statute are applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.385" offset="7276962">Our contention is that the Secretary and the FDA does have that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.531" offset="7301517">The Fourth Circuit held and the respondents contend that he does not, and as they view his authority, the only thing he can do is pass upon applications for new drug approvals or withdraw previously affective applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.835" offset="7370689">He cannot according to their theory decide the threshold question, whether or not, something is a new drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.921" offset="7403081">Bentex involves a drug to deal with the mental problems of senility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.233" offset="7432338">Now Bentex is a 'me-too' manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.104" offset="7443832">There is no NDA outstanding for Bentex as product, but prior to 1962, there were three NDAs outstanding for a similar product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.759" offset="7494405">Upon its review of these drugs, the National Science Foundation Panel concluded that these drugs were in affective for their stated purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.166" offset="7532022">After evaluating the academy studies, Food and Drug concluded preliminary that there was not 'substantial evidence' of effectiveness, and put out a notice of hearing, so stating and giving the manufacturers of these three drugs the opportunity to request a hearing, to show why the drug was effective, and it also invited any interested persons who might be adversely affected by the removal of these drugs from the market to participate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.088" offset="7647692">And finally the notices stated that withdrawal of NDAs for these three drugs will cause any such drug on the market to be a new drug for which an approved New Drug Application is not in effect, and will make it subject to regulatory action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.422" offset="7713102">One of the three NDA holders submitted some material which Food and Drug found was not the substantial evidence as defined by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.806" offset="7750614">And after a second notice published in the Federal register, which again gave interested parties the opportunity to come in, and which again pointed out that the withdrawal of the NDA would cause the 'me-toos' to be new drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.445" offset="7805158">Food and Drug Administration withdrew its approval of the three NDAs covering this drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.045" offset="7835564">No Court review was sought of that action by the three NDA manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.415" offset="7856985">Now under Food and Drug's view of law, the withdrawal of the NDA also had the affect of making the 'me-toos' into new drugs, subject to the pre-marketing clearance, and accordingly Food and Drug sent out letters to a number of manufacturers of the 'me-too' drugs pointing this at to them, and it specifically sent such a letter to Bentex as reprinted in the opinion of the Court of Appeals, and asking Bentex what its intentions were with respect to removing this drug from the market?</text>

            <text syncTime="2017.978" offset="8175261">Now the response of Bentex to this request for information as to what it was going to do remove the drug from the market, was to bring to a lawsuit for a declaratory judgment, in which Bentex is joined by 22 other 'me-too' manufactures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.621" offset="8241821">They sought a declaratory judgment that their products were not new drugs, and were not subject to the application procedures of Section 505.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.891" offset="8294902">The government -- the District Court moved to dismiss the suit on the ground that the District Court had no jurisdiction to determine this question, that this was a -- we made two arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.777" offset="8330428">One, that this was a matter within the exclusive primary jurisdiction to Food and Drug and secondly, that since Bentex had had the opportunity to come into the proceedings for the withdrawal of the NDAs, Bentex was barred from litigating this question in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.072" offset="8403675">The District Court rejected those arguments, and held that it and Food and Drug had concurrent jurisdiction, but it also rejected the plaintiffs' contention in that lawsuit that the District Court had exclusive jurisdiction to determine the question of new drug status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.393" offset="8472952">And what it said was, that the authority of the Food and Drug Administration to approve, or withhold approval of the NDAs, necessarily implies authority for Food and Drug to determine the threshold question of whether the Article involved is a drug which requires an approved new drug application for lawful interstate shipment?</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.349" offset="8568769">And the Court then said, that it thought it was appropriate that the Food and Drug Administration should decide this question in the first instance, because it said, the nature of the proof relevant to that issue makes Food and Drug the more able arbitrator of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.541" offset="8633553">So the evaluation of conflicting reports in the field is not a matter well left to a court without chemical or medical background.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.369" offset="8664900">And accordingly, the District Court deferred any proceedings in the case, until Food and Drug had an opportunity to conduct a hearing on the new drug issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.601" offset="8709726">The government did not appeal that aspect of the case, and has accepted the remand.</text>

            <text syncTime="2616.989" offset="10571316">The climax of this was that Food and Drug withdrew the NDA for CIBA’s drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.529" offset="10597439">CIBA took that question to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the Second Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.278" offset="10624502">At this point -- in the interval, CIBA then filed a District Court suit in New Jersey, in which CIBA claimed that it was not a new drug, and that it was exempt, and it wanted to have that issue determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.725" offset="10686255">The District Court dismissed, the Third Circuit affirmed, basically following the reasoning of the District Court in the Bentex case saying that when Food and Drug undertook to withdraw the New Drug Application, that it necessarily had -- must have decided the threshold question of whether it was a new drug, that CIBA challenged the order of Food and Drug in the Court of Appeals, and when the Court of Appeals upheld that decision, it will also upheld the determination that this was a new drug.</text>

            <text syncTime="2957.877" offset="11934908">In order for there to be a threshold issue, something must be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.146" offset="11959986">It would be our position that in connection with the prosecutions and filings of New Drug Applications, there is in fact no threshold issue, because there is no jurisdictional issue for the Food and Drug Administration to decide.</text>

            <text syncTime="2981.965" offset="12031248">Then you agree that the District Court would have the de nova proceeding to resolve these questions?</text>

            <label>Mr. Clyde A. Szuch</label>
            <text syncTime="2987.505" offset="12053400">We would take the position that the issue of new drug, old drug, only comes about in connection with actions of enforcements, such as seizures, prosecutions, criminal natures or injunctions brought by the Food and Drug Administration after it has concluded independent of a New Drug Application, that the product out there in the market is in fact a new product within the meaning of Section 201 (p), as opposed to section 505 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.240" offset="12196342">If one looks at Section 505 and one examines what actually happens, I believe that the threshold issue will disappear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.853" offset="12242735">When a manufacturer has a drug which it wishes to market it has the initial obligation of determining whether the drug is new or old.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.853" offset="12294771">If he decides, or it decides that the drug is in fact a new drug, it then goes to the administration and files a New Drug Application seeking approval of that application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.720" offset="12354226">Once the New Drug Application has been presented to the administration, there is no longer any issue before it, as to whether that drug is a new or an old drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.476" offset="12401246">The manufacturer says nothing in it's application to the Food and Drug Administration on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.406" offset="12429040">The statute calls for nothing on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.874" offset="12446908">The matter is put before the authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.650" offset="12461955">It decides and then we are off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.333" offset="12472717">Taking the other situation of the withdrawal; the fact that the drug is new or old is irrelevant to whether the Food and Drug should withdraw it's approval of the NDA which may be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.652" offset="12549935">For example, even if one were to assume, and concede, the government and the manufacturer, that the drug were an old drug, if the manufacturer were not filing the requisite reports required by 505, it seems mandatory that approval of the New Drug Application be withdrawn for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.866" offset="12662888">There does not seem to be any option in the statute we would submit, which would authorize the administrator to decide that he is not going to act in this particular instance to not withdraw, because the drug is old.</text>

            <text syncTime="3290.382" offset="13264854">505 does not in any way involve the issue of whether the drug is new or old.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.465" offset="13301217">The approval of a new drug application we submit, has to be approved or disapproved, whether the drug involved is new or old.</text>

            <text syncTime="3332.440" offset="13433083">This decision would be under Section 201 (p) of the statute which defines whether a product is a new or an old drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.798" offset="13474565">Now here under 201 (p) proof is required that there is not general recognition amongst experts that the product is safe and effective.</text>

            <text syncTime="3358.276" offset="13536528">The government suggests that it's incongruous that there would be two different schemes and two different approaches to this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.251" offset="13568397">We would submit however that there is logic to this dual route on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.792" offset="13598490">Number one, the statute doesn't put this issue before the government under 505.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.255" offset="13624404">Number two, the 201 (p) test applies to a limited number of drugs, those that were being marketed between 38 and 62.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.830" offset="13678738">Now as to those drugs, Congress could well have concluded that the field of expertise present in the people out in the countryside working with the products that were out there every day that there were experts comparable to the kinds of experts that the administration could find in their own administrative proceedings and we would suggest that it was concluded that the field of expertise was not exclusive to the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.782" offset="13814471">We are not dealing with products or items that are peculiar to an agency's expertise.</text>

            <text syncTime="3436.149" offset="13848012">All the expertise on that subject is not vested in the FDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.878" offset="13862849">There is a vast reservoir and storehouse acknowledge in this area, in the hospitals, in the colleges and universities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.072" offset="13891688">And we would submit that Congress in effect said that if those people that are out there working with the products, not the lay bee, but people who are expert in their field, if those people concluded that this product was generally recognized as safe and effective then that product could be marketed and that a manufacturer need not go before FDA and produce reams of evidence on useless issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="3678.574" offset="14817677">Right, I think the anecdotal evidence, it would be on a totally different plain, as I would understand it, that's either that the local pharmacists or the local patient or a particular doctor who is not qualified, qualify generally, but not qualified particularly from an expert point of view to testify, is not that type of evidence that 201 (p) is looking for under the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.112" offset="14919868">201 (p) as set for the page 475 of the joint appendix says that the experts must be qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Drugs as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.805" offset="15010565">So that it is incumbent to produce people with this high level of skill which we would submit will result in no lesser consideration of whether the drug is in fact safe or effective than the standard which is found under 505.</text>

            <label>Mr. George F. Townes</label>
            <text syncTime="3868.123" offset="15575855">Now, let me illustrate the great difference that is involved in determining whether a drug is new and determining whether a “new drug” application should be approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3885.081" offset="15643669">If my clients had sat back and awaited enforcement proceedings in a District Court as they had the right to do, it would have been incumbent on the government as prosecutor against them for selling an unapproved “new drug” to prove that the drug was in fact new.</text>
            <text syncTime="3907.518" offset="15733426">Now, under the definition and under a number of Court decisions, the most widely respected being the Klikova (ph) case which is also a very an attaining case to read, the government would produce two or three or four qualified experts, typically chairman of particular medical department, well recognized specialist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.860" offset="15854843">They would be placed on the stand and asked after their qualifications were illustrated to what extent were they familiar with the reputation among qualified experts in this field as to the safety of this product for the uses that the product is supposed to be for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.138" offset="15943973">And they would explain how they kept day-to-day track of the literature, they subscribed to many journals, they went to many symposiums, they read many books, they conversed with their colleagues and attended the meetings and they were familiar with reputation and then he would ask them, “what is it that reputation?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.819" offset="16034670">And he would say well, nobody – frequently most drugs are pretty safe so let's this expert say this one is recognized it safe and then he will be asked, “is it recognized as effective?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.615" offset="16089840">And he would say, well, frankly no, it used to be a long time ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.484" offset="16105305">Few people thought it did pretty good job and tried, there weren't any good studies of it and as time went on, we realized that it really didn't work and nobody pays attention to it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.425" offset="16157027">Now that is the Government's case really in so many words.</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.549" offset="16173537">A manufacturer, if he is attempting to defend this case and very, very, very few of these cases either have been defended or will be defended because the burden on the manufacture is extremely great.</text>
            <text syncTime="4032.204" offset="16232155">Once that testimony has been put up against, he has got to, by he is own experts of equal statute really, if you want, you have to have equal statute, show that for summaries, the government experts were mistaken in their estimate of their colleague's general opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.163" offset="16332048">Now very few of these cases in fact arise for that simple reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="4062.465" offset="16353259">It would be rare and it is rare that you would not immediately appreciate what the consensus of informed opinion was concerning a product.</text>
            <text syncTime="4074.869" offset="16402892">The Klikova (ph) case is a case in which the manufacturer did prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="4079.874" offset="16422849">There was a Virginia case and the man had a headache remedy, he thought Klikova (ph) was cute name for it, consisted of Aspirin and Caffeine and few other things and it was the Government's position that he was in some way representing as to the effective for alcoholism.</text>
            <text syncTime="4096.756" offset="16490350">And the Court said, no, he is just saying a hangover and hangover symptoms and Aspirin is effective for headache and then you have a headache when you have a hang over and so forth and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.073" offset="16531623">So out of a number of variations of this product, the Court did feel that in one instance the Government was really being too extreme and that this was safe and effective for that limited use.</text>
            <text syncTime="4120.703" offset="16586167">Now that is the type of issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.680" offset="16594108">This flood of litigation is not going to appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4127.456" offset="16613230">A very few cases have been litigated in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.051" offset="16623574">The industry has always understood, this to be a District Court issue and the issue is this reputation of the Drug among the Scientific Community.</text>
            <text syncTime="4145.444" offset="16685119">Now granted in a trial the reputation will be discussed and explored and what do you -- what do your colleagues think it's not worth, but all the court has to pass on is that reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4156.243" offset="16728377">Now that is an entirely, entirely different issue from the issue of whether a drug in fact has been demonstrated to be safe and effective under the criteria of Section 505, the new Drug application proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.578" offset="16797654">That is a scientific question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.612" offset="16817821">But as a matter of fact under this branding procedure for example, Congress itself puts on the court certain burdens of passing on scientific questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4191.919" offset="16871006">You are prosecuted for misrepresenting this drug to be effective for particular use.</text>
            <text syncTime="4196.708" offset="16890232">The government must prove it's ineffective under this branding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4201.966" offset="16911235">Now, the FDA has died out as a police agency, I say the FDA it's predecessors under the 1906 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4211.921" offset="16951045">In 1938, Congress said, well, for a new drugs, for new drugs let's require pre marketing clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.864" offset="16994826">Now Congress was talking about a new drug, something new and it came up with a definition which is as good definition as you can come up with.</text>
            <text syncTime="4233.746" offset="17038399">At that point, a new drug was defined as a drug which qualified experts generally did not regard as safe and it's a difficult definition to apply at times, but I don't see how you can improve on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4245.703" offset="17086151">Now as to everything else in the 1938 Act pertaining to this general situation, there were these police powers created.</text>
            <text syncTime="4254.668" offset="17122095">If you ship a new drug without approval, if you mis-plan the drug, if you adulterate a drug, the product can be seized in a District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.739" offset="17162324">You can enjoined in the District Court, you can demand a jury or you can be prosecuted in a District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="4790.657" offset="19266017">I just like to say two things briefly in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4793.358" offset="19276779">First in response to a colloquially that Justice Stewart had with Mr. Szuch.</text>
            <text syncTime="4798.703" offset="19298200">The FDA on many occasions has sent back applications that had been filed for new drugs on the ground that nobody -- that it was not needed, i.e. that it wasn't a new drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="4810.815" offset="19346683">Secondly I just want to stress -- it seems to us that the anomaly of the respondent's position here is well illustrated by the facts of the CIBA case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4821.174" offset="19388061">The reason Food and Drug initiated a withdrawal proceeding in the CIBA case was because it had reason to believe that CIBA's drug was ineffective and it wanted to stop CIBA from marketing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4834.439" offset="19441142">It held a full proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4836.156" offset="19448038">It concluded that CIBA's drug was ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4839.060" offset="19459636">It withdrew the NDA and that action was upheld by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4843.627" offset="19477922">Now under this theory that Food and Drug is no authority to determine the new drug status, this whole proceeding was amounted to basically annuity because CIBA now claims it can turn around and re-litigate under the new drug standard in the District Court, the question whether or not it's able to market it at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="4873.964" offset="19599235">But I come back to the fact once again that is just not a practical method of dealing with this large number of drugs that we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="4884.003" offset="19639359">You just cannot accomplish the congressional purpose of getting these ineffective drugs off the market, but the only thing that Food and Drug can do is that when it finds one that it thinks is ineffective is to bring the suit in the District Court to enjoin them to seize the drug or to prosecute them criminally.</text>

            <text syncTime="4956.633" offset="19929945">The Hynson cases numbers 394 and 414 are here on writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the Fourth Circuit holding that the commissioner acted improperly in withdrawing approval, for instance product Lutrexin without a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4973.361" offset="19996818">Lutrexin is a drug product whose active ingredient Lututrin is an extract from sow ovaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4980.537" offset="20025553">It's offered for the treatment for dysmenorrhea, threatened and habitual abortion and to prevent premature labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4987.768" offset="20054392">Hynson filed a new drug for Lutrexin in 1953 at which time safety was the sole criterion for evaluation of such applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="4998.327" offset="20096711">The agency allowed the application to go into effect, although wrote Hynson, advising it at that time that the studies submitted did not indicate that the drug was effective for these purposes and urging Hynson not to market it particularly for threatened and habitual abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5014.076" offset="20159718">Now after the 1962 amendments, Lutrexin was reviewed by the National Academy of Sciences which concluded, the panel concluded that Hynson's claims for Lutrexin were inappropriate and unwarranted in the absence of adequate scientific studies to support them. Lutrexin was rated possibly effective, which was the rating that specifically means that the panel found there was a lack of substantial evidence supporting Lutrexin's effectiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5048.184" offset="20296077">After receiving the National Academy of Sciences' rating and making his own review of the information before him and giving Hynson the opportunity to submit further information, the commissioner tentatively concluded that there was no substantial evidence of the effectiveness of Lutrexin and in March 1969 published a notice of its intent to withdraw approval for Lutrexin's new drug application.</text>
            <text syncTime="5071.886" offset="20390954">He offered an opportunity for hearing which Lutrexin at that time -- Hynson at that time accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5077.726" offset="20414255">Then in August 1969 Hynson filed suit in the District Court seeking to block further proceedings before the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="5086.704" offset="20450200">A year later this suit was dismissed on primary jurisdiction on exhaustion grounds and Hynson was remitted to the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="5097.436" offset="20493145">In the meanwhile FDA had adopted the regulations which Mr. Friedman described to you, carefully defining what kinds of studies would be considered adequate and well controlled so that they could qualify a substantial evidence of effectiveness under the 1962 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="5116.690" offset="20570154">The regulations further dealt with the question of when a hearing would be made available and it required the manufacturer in requesting a hearing to submit and I am quoting to the regulation as it appears at page 491 of the appendix, “A well organized and full factual analysis of the clinical and other investigational data he is prepared to prove in support of his opposition to the notice for opportunity of a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5145.542" offset="20685511">A request for hearing may not rest upon mere allegations or denials, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine and substantial issue of facts that requires a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5157.136" offset="20731904">When it clearly appears from the data in an application and from the reasons and factual analysis and the request for the hearing that there is no genuine and substantial issue of fact which precludes the refusal to approve the application or the withdrawal of approval of the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="5172.338" offset="20792717">That is no adequate in well controlled clinical investigations to support the claims of effectiveness which have been identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="5179.460" offset="20821243">The commissioner will enter an order on this data making findings and conclusions on this data.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5187.934" offset="20855097">Now the commissioner wrote to Hynson and advised them of the new regulations and ask them to make a new submission in conformity with the requirements of the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5196.272" offset="20888430">Hynson made a further submission after it had lost the District Court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5201.236" offset="20908283">In this submission, it made three contentions to the commissioner which are here before you in this petition and cross petition here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5210.066" offset="20943600">First it contended that Lutrexin is today generally recognized as both safe and effective and therefore not a new drug and not within the regulatory jurisdiction of the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5221.903" offset="20990934">Secondly, it contended that because Lutrexin was generally recognized as safe, in October 1962 it was exempted under section 107 (c) (4) of the 1962 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="5233.759" offset="21038373">Thirdly, it contended that in fact there was substantial evidence to support Lutrexin's claims of effectiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5240.945" offset="21067107">The commissioner reviewed the material submitted by Hynson and he rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="5246.051" offset="21087587">He refused the hearing on all three of these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="5255.309" offset="21124577">On review, the Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5257.775" offset="21134503">It purported not to question the validity of the commissioner's regulations defining what would constitute or qualify as substantial evidence and not to question the regulations providing for a hearing only when there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact regarding whether such evidence exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="5275.626" offset="21205870">Nevertheless, it held that the material submitted by Hynson was sufficient to raise the genuine issue for the drug's effectiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5283.112" offset="21235858">It dismissed the commissioner's evaluation of the studies which he had carefully made in his order, noting that while this was perhaps valid, it was the kind of thing that should only be done after a hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="6453.265" offset="25916479">It reviewed these 4,000 or so New Drug Applications that had been filled between 1938-1962 and that were for products that was still being marketed, and the National Academy of Sciences submitted recommendations and reports showing that they were somewhere between 12,000 and 13,000 claims that appeared not to be supported by substantial evidence of effectiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="6482.500" offset="26033403">Now if any significant proportion of the manufacturers of drugs making these claims asked for full-dress evidentiary hearings, each of which can last two, three, four months, just in order and keep their product on the market until FDA could act, the mission of withdrawing ineffective drugs from the market would be totally sabotaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="6505.981" offset="26127339">It will simply be impossible for the agency to deal with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6508.959" offset="26139251">I think the question that was asked earlier in the argument, there are 24 lawyers available to enforce the Food and Drug laws that court actions and administrative proceedings, that is besides of the General Counsel's office of Food and Drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="6524.124" offset="26199855">Now what -- the way that the agency responded to this problem and the reason it was able to respond this way was that there was in the statute an objective standard which said, if you don't have adequate and well-controlled investigations, then you can't stay on the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6545.070" offset="26283656">So the commissioner adopted what in effect is a screening procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="6549.054" offset="26299538">He said to the manufacturer.</text>

            <text syncTime="6720.791" offset="26986559">It did not necessarily imply a concurrent control group but you could use historical controls if you have a disease, the course of which is so well known, if you have appropriate pairing of the people in the treatment group that you are studying against your historical control group so that you can exclude the possibility that the difference in results is due to something other than the drug that you are testing, but you need some scientifically sound way of attributing the results of your test, of your treatment to the drug that you are testing and if don't have that, you simply don't have the kind of evidence the Congress requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="6757.064" offset="27131591">And I would like to point out if you would look for a minute at the appendix, at page 103, none of the materials that Hynson submitted has anybody ever suggested could possibly constitute adequate and well-controlled investigation except for the Majewski and Jennings' studies and the Gratton (ph) study, that's three studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="6782.821" offset="27234617">Now, if you look at the Majewski and Jennings study which starts at page 99, he sets out to study the ability of Lutrexin to halt contractions and he comes up with the statistics as to the number of people in whom the contractions were halted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6802.294" offset="27312567">He never compares that with anybody or anything, there is simply no comparison whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="6807.330" offset="27332733">It's obviously no way to tell whether Lutrexin halted the contractions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6810.808" offset="27346631">For all we know from this study, contraction spontaneously halt at the same rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6816.327" offset="27368678">That's what I mean by the lack of the control and that's what the commissioner meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6819.776" offset="27382471">Now if look at page 103, he had 88 patients in his study group.</text>
            <text syncTime="6826.207" offset="27408175">All 88 of these patients gave birth prematurely according to the study.</text>
            <text syncTime="6830.697" offset="27426147">Now does this study demonstrate that Lutrexin is effective to stop prematurity?</text>
            <text syncTime="6836.612" offset="27449866">He has no statistical analysis of this table four at the top of 103.</text>

            <text syncTime="7094.339" offset="28480763">These studies simply are miles, light years away from meeting these requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="7098.827" offset="28498631">I think I, in view of the time, would like to move on to another point if I am clear enough for the questions on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="7106.639" offset="28529977">I would like to turn to the question which was touched upon earlier and which involves the correctness of the commissioner's denial of a hearing on the question of whether Lutrexin is today generally recognized as safe and effective and therefore not a new drug and therefore not subject to this regulatory jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="7125.181" offset="28604061">But the commissioner said was if there is no substantial evidence of effectiveness, if there isn't the kind of scientific evidence that Congress said was required, then these qualified experts who, that Section 201 (p) talk about, couldn't possibly arrive at the conclusion that the drug is effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="7142.651" offset="28673964">They could not have that general recognition of effectiveness because it would be based on the precise kind of unscientific clinical impressions on controlled studies, the very kind of thing that Congress had been told was an unreliable bases for evaluating drug effectiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="7159.881" offset="28742928">Congress had the foremost experts in the country before it and they were uniform in their testimony that you need controlled test, you need scientifically sound evaluation and Congress heeded their advice and Congress enacted in the statute a specific requirement of adequate and well-controlled investigations a concrete objective requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="7182.492" offset="28833311">Now it simply is it seems to us totally irrational to suppose that after Congress went to all the trouble of adopting this standard and rejecting these kinds of unscientific impressions that people have because they use the drug a few times and it seem good to them and so did their colleagues, but the drug should turn around and be able to stay on the market, that is the Commissioner has evaluated.</text>
            <text syncTime="7207.922" offset="28935084">He has found that won’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="7210.215" offset="28944280">The drug doesn't have sub-scientifically sound evidence of effectiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="7213.727" offset="28958281">Now the manufacturer turns around and says, well, that's very interesting, that's fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="7217.689" offset="28974164">I am going to go ahead and market it anyway and I can produce 10 or 15 doctors who will tell you that they think it's effective on the basis of their uncontrolled, unscientific experience.</text>

            <text syncTime="8141.310" offset="32668609">Now, I would like to just conclude this one point since so much has made of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="8146.619" offset="32689821">It is also significant to note, in any event the government studies did not involve as do Hynson's treatments of patients with histories of prior pregnancy.</text>

            <text syncTime="8193.492" offset="32877380">In such a case the use of a Double-blind, Placebo type would be unethical according to Doctors Ressick (ph) Gratton, Majewky, and Allen.</text>
            <text syncTime="8205.419" offset="32925027">Allen the later, Allen being a member of the panel of the NAS-NRC which evaluated Lutrexin.</text>
            <text syncTime="8214.312" offset="32960658">It was his opinion stated on the no rise letter to us that Lutrexin should not be taken off the market, that they never had such an intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="8226.939" offset="33011127">Now I should I think it might help if I listed the issues which I think were in these two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="8241.888" offset="33070895">In 72-394 which involves primarily the hearings, the questions are whether Hynson is entitled to a hearing on the question of whether there is substantial evidence of safety and efficacy as distinguished from a hearing on the jurisdictional questions which I should report to.</text>
            <text syncTime="8269.065" offset="33179669">Secondly whether the new May 1970 regulations which are in the back part of the appendix under which a hearing was denied or valid as applied to FDA by FDA to Lutrexin and finally whether HEW and Hynson’s right to hearing vested under the former regulations which preceded these when Hynson accepted the offer of a hearing by a letter to Food and Drug Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="8303.714" offset="33318222">In number 72_414 which is in support in which we file the brief in support of the cross petition, the basic question is whether the Court of Appeals was right in its conclusion that the commissioner was unauthorized initially to determine his own jurisdiction under Section 201 (p) the definition of new drug, that is whether the drug Lutrexin is generally recognize the safe and effective under the act as amended in 1062, whether it was deemed to prove under Section 107 © (2) of the act, if it was, it is not subject to administrative withdrawal proceedings under Section 505 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="8362.476" offset="33553324">Three, whether the drug was exempt from the effectiveness requirements of Section 107 (c) (4), so called “grandfather clause.”</text>
            <text syncTime="8372.638" offset="33593971">If so then it is our view that none of the effectiveness in provisions of the statute are applicable to that drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="8383.986" offset="33639320">There has been considerable discussion of the matter of general recognition of safety and effectiveness and as I understand the government's position and I think I do understand it, they maintain that general recognition of safety and effectiveness which is the test of new drug status is dependent upon the existence of substantial evidence of effectiveness as defined in the 1962 Amendments, in an entirely different section of the statute, not the covered section in 505 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="8430.058" offset="33823640">And that in effect, the substantial evidence definition is a part of Section 201 (n) and there is no real difference between the determination of new drug status and a determination of whether the drug is safe and effective.</text>

            <text syncTime="8538.791" offset="34258526">Some of these drugs which have been on the market for years are obviously generally recognized as safe and effective and they may or may not have published studies upon which that conclusion was -- by which that conclusion was arrived at.</text>

            <text syncTime="8576.796" offset="34410559">It is always been accepted by FDA and the industry and FDA changed this view only after -- some years after the effective date of the 1962 Amendment which did not even touch that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="8598.697" offset="34498121">Now, the right to a hearing on the question of substantial evidence; the briefs of the government in these cases place great, if not primary emphasis upon the alleged incapacity of FDA to administer Section 505 as amended in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="8623.914" offset="34599058">If the anticipated demands for hearings, that is the hearings anticipated by the government and withdrawal proceedings have to be met by the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="8636.764" offset="34650467">We explain, however, in our brief in number 72-394 beginning at page 33, that only if there is an issue of material fact, need a hearing be granted by the government -- by the Food and Drug Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="8653.542" offset="34717550">In the case of an application for approval of the drug as distinguished from the question of whether it's generally recognized as safe and effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="8664.881" offset="34762898">In the case of such an application it is expressly provided in the statute that if the applicant accepts an opportunity for hearing within 30 days of notice of such opportunity, such hearing shall commence not more than 90 days after the expiration of such 30 days unless the secretary and the applicant otherwise agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="8690.143" offset="34863940">That is explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="8692.847" offset="34874807">I don't see how an ex parte decision such as was made in this case denying a hearing could be made under such a provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="8702.891" offset="34914931">The right to hearing in the withdrawal proceeding must be no less firm both as I read the statue and as I read the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="8714.836" offset="34962683">In fact Senator Eastland expressly stated in explaining this withdrawal provision to the Senate, “Withdrawal of approval of a new drug application would be preceded by hearing with findings on the basis of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="8733.785" offset="35038542">That's rather explicit. Certainly in this situation where as I think we show in our briefs, there likelihood of an overpowering number of required hearings seem in reality remote.</text>
            <text syncTime="8749.147" offset="35099982">The cases are applicable which hold that inconvenience or lack of staff or lack of money or the prospect of delay is not good reason for dispensing with the minimal requirement of a hearing in a adjudicatory manner which isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="8772.342" offset="35192769">The cases are recited in our brief in number 394 and they include – the Ohio Bell Telephone case and the Wong Sang Yung (ph) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8784.166" offset="35239999">That's at page 37 and 38.</text>
            <text syncTime="8788.197" offset="35256195">So despite the express fears of the government of a multiplicity in hearings, we think it is safe to say that the necessary showing of the existence of a material fact and that's all that has been shown, would drastically curb even the tendency to request such hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="8810.900" offset="35346996">The government fear is based on speculation, not on evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="8815.202" offset="35364133">In any event we believe we have shown in our brief in number 394 that an issue of material fact exists with respect to the efficacy of Lutrexin.</text>
            <text syncTime="8839.407" offset="35460995">We do not deny that Section 701 (a) of the act authorizes the Food and Drug Administration to make general rules for its enforcement, obviously it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="8852.263" offset="35512404">Such regulations have the status of law if they are reasonable and in accordance with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="8861.686" offset="35550124">The new drug regulations of May 8, 1972 to which we referred earlier, relating to substantial evidence of effectiveness and the right to a hearing were issued under the Section 701 (a) to implement the definition of new drug in Section 201 (p) and the definition and section 505 the operative new drug section.</text>
            <text syncTime="8887.590" offset="35653778">It is those regulations with which these cases are concerned, not the regulations published in the federal register May 21, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="8902.857" offset="35714800">For classification of over-the-counter drugs as to the new drug studies, we do not consider those OTC drugs are valid because they represent an attempt to circumvent the provisions of Section 505 of the Act by a classification system and set up by the adjudication procedure contemplated by that Section, but they are not before the Court today in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="8939.114" offset="35859832">In Storer Broadcasting case which was cited by the government in support of its proposition that a rule can always be substituted for adjudication, did not circumvent the basic statutory provision, such as Section 505.</text>
            <text syncTime="8961.287" offset="35948544">The relative is simple ownership rule, Station Ownership rule there involved, could be readily applied and did not concern a variety of different articles or drugs or stations with different labeling and different characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="8983.106" offset="36035793">As this Court recognized in Securities and Exchange Commission versus Chenery, the problem may be so specialized and varying in nature as to the impossible of capture within the boundaries of the general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="8999.513" offset="36101413">Our basic position with respect to the May 1970 regulations is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="9008.377" offset="36136835">First as they have been applied to Hynson's drug Lutrexin there invalid because the commissioner refused to recognize that the evidence submitted by Hynson raises a substantial issue of material fact as to whether there is substantial issue, that is a substantial evidence of a effectiveness of Lutrexin and failed to produce prima facie evidence to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="9040.612" offset="36265775">Under such circumstances, a hearing is required by the statute, we submit, before the commissioner may legally withdraw approval of the drug under section 503 (e) three on the ground of lack of substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="9057.691" offset="36334111">Under the summary judgment Rule of the R.C.P as I have said, upon which these FDA rules are allegedly patterned, it is clearly the burden of the proponent to show by prima facie evidence, if there is no issue material fact presented by such evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="9078.405" offset="36416972">Moreover, under that rile the opposing party is entitled to depose or examine the witnesses of the other party.</text>
            <text syncTime="9091.607" offset="36469844">It is clear that aside from the burden of proof rules in the summary judgment procedures, the Administrative Procedure Act requires that FDA as a proponent of the order shoulder the burden of proof to show a lack of substantial evidence and this it did not do, also this is clear from the language of Section 505.</text>
            <text syncTime="9121.329" offset="36588648">The second basic objection to the May 1970 regulation because if they combine and a commissioner both the prosecutorial function and the judging function.</text>
            <text syncTime="9133.892" offset="36638908">We recognize that the commissioner must make the eventual and final decision as to whether the drug should be withdrawn, but it is unfair, we think to provide for an ex parte decision by the commissioner without the submission by him of any evidence whatsoever to rebut the studies and affidavits of the distinguished obstetricians and gynecologists which instant (Inaudible) presented.</text>

            <text syncTime="9343.404" offset="37477021">The Hemsworth and Dieckmann (ph) studies were significantly different in the sense that they were controlled and I think if you understand and look at the studies you will see this.</text>
            <text syncTime="9351.911" offset="37510980">They took the group of patients in the studies and they split them into two groups and they paired them in order to eliminate the differences between the two groups.</text>

            <text syncTime="9365.569" offset="37565628">They were comparable as much as could reasonably be made possible except that one group had DES and one didn't and I think that is a significant difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="9408.913" offset="37738977">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9412.034" offset="37751515">The fifth and final case in these consolidated proceedings is USV Pharmaceutical Corporation against Wienberger.</text>
            <text syncTime="9419.066" offset="37779623">This case is here certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and like Ciba and Bentex, it arose as a civil action in the district court for a declaratory judgment, that the products involved are not new drugs as define by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="9433.663" offset="37838033">The issues in the USV case involve solely the interpretation of the Grandfather Clause in the 1962 amendments, Section 107 (c) (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="9442.912" offset="37875022">The district court held that the products involved do enjoy grandfather status and the Court of Appeals held they do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="9450.393" offset="37904906">Now before proceeding to the specifics of this case perhaps it would be helpful to step back for a moment and look at the overall statutory scheme which we have been discussing, since 10 o' Clock this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="9466.166" offset="37968018">There has been some imprecise use of terms during the course of the arguments and with the Court permission I should like to briefly restate some of the fundamental principles with which we are confronted.</text>
            <text syncTime="9480.110" offset="38023816">There are only two relevant terms used in the statute of all those shorthand expressions that have been brought up today.</text>
            <text syncTime="9488.480" offset="38057253">As Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out the term “old drug” does not appear in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="9492.840" offset="38074702">There are only two terms, the terms are “drug” and “new drug” both of these are specifically defined in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="9501.033" offset="38107512">And for present purposes we need not get into the details of the definition of the drug generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="9508.099" offset="38135724">We can just assume that this refers to what we normally think of as drugs, but the term “new drug” in explicitly defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="9516.484" offset="38169266">A special class of drugs is carved out is define by Section 201 (p) of the Act and this is been so since 1938, so that the Act regulates all drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="9528.114" offset="38215868">It regulated drugs generally in a certain manner and it regulates new drugs in a very specific manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="9534.965" offset="38243244">This scheme is described in the brief for the proprietary association which is the thick light green brief at pages 4-9 and also in the PMA brief which is this thick dark green brief at pages 28-29 and rather than repeat what it said there let me simply summarize.</text>
            <text syncTime="9555.068" offset="38323597">In 1938, the basic Food and Drug Act, Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906 was totally revamped to strengthen the authority of Food and Drug Administration to protect the public in the field of drugs, this obviously is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="9571.605" offset="38389844">But the powers of the Food and Drug Administration was strengthened very largely by way of increasing their authority as an enforcement agency, a prosecutor if you will, in the district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="9584.537" offset="38441566">The basic statutory scheme which applies to the regulation of drugs contemplates that the substantive probations of the Act will enforced in civil or criminal actions brought in the name of the United States on the reference of the Food and Drug Administration in the District Courts, so that if the drug is misbranded the remedy available to the government is a civil action to seize the product or for an injunction or a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="9610.649" offset="38545951">If a drug is adulterated, the same remedies are available, a civil action procedure or for an injunction or a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="9619.600" offset="38581791">The Food and Drug Administration has no direct authority with an exception that I will refer to in a few moments, to directly enforce these prohibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="9631.168" offset="38628080">As was pointed out in response to a question of Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the agency has no seize and desist order -- authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="9638.530" offset="38657442">This is not the Federal Trade Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="9640.599" offset="38665801">This is an executive branch agency, which refers cases to the Department of Justice for prosecution or for the initiation of civil actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="9648.454" offset="38697148">Nor for that matter does the agency has subpoena power, in the proceeding it does conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="9653.760" offset="38718464">This is been recently pointed out in the study by the administrative conference which categorizes FDA as perhaps the most important agency in the government which doesn't have any subpoena power.</text>
            <text syncTime="9664.456" offset="38761200">So the agency, the Congress strengthened in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="9668.868" offset="38778859">Just to repeat it once more, is essentially a policing agency in regard to drugs, except with regard to new drugs has specifically defined by the statute and that is the class of drugs with which -- are now which in this case are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="9684.414" offset="38841031">Now the definition of new drug is set forth in 201(p) and the basic function of 201 (p) is to act as a bow or a selecting gate to determine down which regulatory road a particular product will travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="9700.502" offset="38905396">If the drug is a new drug, as defined in the statute then it is channeled into an administrative applied regulatory scheme conducted by the Food and Drug Administration, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="9712.510" offset="38953462">If however the product is not a new drug as defined by the statute, then it is simply outside that administrative regulatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="9721.961" offset="38991182">The drug is regulated in the civil actions, in criminal prosecutions which I described a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="9731.800" offset="39030575">The standard of whether a product is a new drug is Section 201 (p) and this is printed at page 3 of our brief which is the thick blue brief and also at page 482 of the joint appendix and it provides that a drug is a new drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="9748.147" offset="39095986">If it is a drug a composition of which is such that it is not generally recognized by qualified experts as safe and effective for its intended uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="9757.877" offset="39134856">Now in 1938, when this statute was first enacted, the word effective didn't appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="9763.256" offset="39156381">A drug was regarded as a new drug if it was not generally recognized as safe intended uses, effectiveness didn't enter into the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="9773.915" offset="39199013">The determination, however, whether a product was generally recognized to say is a factual determination and once that a factual determination as to the state of informed expert opinion on the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="9787.837" offset="39254706">The question in short was not whether the drug was in fact safe, because it might in fact be safe, but not be generally recognized as safe, the question was whether the consensus of informed expert opinion was that the product was safe, and in the absence of such a consensus, the product would be classified as a new drug.</text>

            <text syncTime="9831.799" offset="39430562">There has been a great deal of discussion as to whether you have to have substantial evidence as defined in the statute in 1962 that is controlled clinical studies to have general recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="9841.688" offset="39470164">The government says that you do, the companies in these cases are uniformly I believe that you do not need to have it but if the government is right, that an expert couldn't possibly come to a conclusion as to the safety of product without controlled clinical studies or for that matter it's effectiveness, then you won't be able to --</text>

            <label>Mr. Joel E. Hoffman</label>
            <text syncTime="9870.908" offset="39586983">Well, the 1962 Act defines substantial evidence in terms of controlled clinical studies with regard to the application of the standards for approval or disapproval by FDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="9881.678" offset="39630033">As Mr. Williams pointed out, this definition does not in terms apply to the question of general recognition for purposes of classifying the drug in the first instance, but the statute doesn't say that the experts consensus has to be a correct one, viewed from the management point of FDA or anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="9903.073" offset="39715715">The test is whether there is a consensus?</text>
            <text syncTime="9905.124" offset="39723865">Now, if the government is right, that substantial evidence in the statutory sense of effectiveness under the new statute, or under the old statute which I would like to return in a moment, whether there is a consensus as to substantial evidence of safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="9920.956" offset="39787186">If that depends on whether there are controlled clinical studies then they won't be a consensus because if the government is right, the experts simply won't come to a conclusion, if they are really qualified experts.</text>
            <text syncTime="9931.679" offset="39830131">It may be that they will come to that conclusion notwithstanding the absence of studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="9935.893" offset="39846954">Now the presence of studies maybe relevant to an expert in deciding that he does or he doesn't recognize the product as safe or it is effective and it maybe that it won't recognize that it is safe or is effective if they are any studies, but the statute doesn't tell the expert on what basis he has to decide for the purpose of the consensus.</text>

            <text syncTime="10082.912" offset="40435022">For many years, beginning in 1955, USV, the petitioner in this case has marketed a line of products principally containing a substance called citrus flavonoid compound.</text>
            <text syncTime="10093.476" offset="40477236">This is a naturally occurring combination of substances called bioflavonoids which are derived from citrus fruits.</text>
            <text syncTime="10099.598" offset="40501791">And the recommended use with the products is the control of abnormal capillary permeability and fragility, which is a condition of the capillary walls, sometimes found in conjunction with serious ailments involved in bleeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="10112.733" offset="40554350">This side condition results when it is present in excessively easy rapture of the tiny capillary blood vessels which lie near the surface of the skin or near internal surfaces and USV’s citrus flavonoid products are recommended to physicians only as an aid of strengthening the capillary walls and in that sense they are a prescription product that promoted for this use to physicians only although they are available without a prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="10138.377" offset="40656854">If you went and asked for CVP for example you could get it, but there will be nothing on the box to tell you that this is what it is good for.</text>
            <text syncTime="10144.829" offset="40682663">The promotion is only to physicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="10147.070" offset="40691649">The products in the line of products in question formed two separate groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="10152.132" offset="40711920">The original products in the line were new drugs as defined by the statute in 1955, when they were first introduced for this use for abnormal capillary permeability and fragility.</text>
            <text syncTime="10163.069" offset="40755597">And USV therefore filed a new drug applications for them under Section 505 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="10169.852" offset="40782764">Now by new drug application, I also mean what has been referred to today as NDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="10179.215" offset="40820276">Now this Act, it is a another term that doesn't appear in the statute, and in response to Mr. Justice Stewart's question of this morning, I would say that the term NDA does mean New Drug Application, it doesn't mean New Drug Approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="10193.337" offset="40876701">It doesn't appear anywhere in the statute, this acronym.</text>
            <text syncTime="10196.417" offset="40889031">The statute talks about applications, applications under Section 505, it does not talk about NDAs.</text>
            <text syncTime="10202.508" offset="40913377">I have not personally heard of any use of the acronym to refer to a new drug approval until the Court of Appeals opinion in the Bentex case.</text>
            <text syncTime="10215.464" offset="40965204">I think that most members of the Food and Drug Bar would be surprised to learn that it refers to something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="10220.966" offset="40987251">The common understanding of NDA is New Drug Application, but the important point is that the statute doesn’t talk about NDAs, whatever NDA means, it talks about applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="10230.753" offset="41026435">So at least for my purposes when I use the abbreviation, I am referring to the application, the new drug application.</text>
            <text syncTime="10238.599" offset="41057782">After the new drug applications filed by USV have become effective with the original products in this line and the products covered by them had become generally recognized as safe for their recommended use, so that they were no longer new drugs for that use as defined by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="10253.955" offset="41119222">USV introduced two additional products of the same type.</text>
            <text syncTime="10257.729" offset="41134268">New editions of old drugs such as these two are usually called 'Me-too' products, that's another term that doesn't appear in the statute, it's a shorthand, and it has some pejorative connotations that were perhaps intended by those who developed the term, but I think today it has no such connotations.</text>
            <text syncTime="10276.077" offset="41207724">'Me-too' products are competing products, competitive products.</text>
            <text syncTime="10279.046" offset="41219532">They are brought up on the market after a so called pioneer product that has been on the market sufficiently long, so that drugs of this type becomes generally recognized as safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="10292.275" offset="41272508">These two products were never the subject of New Drug Applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="10296.055" offset="41287555">The manufacturer never filed an application for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="10299.374" offset="41300825">They were simply brought out as drugs not new drugs or as old drugs, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="10304.969" offset="41323290">There was no new drug application filed for them, no new drug application became effective for them, they were never regulated as new drug by the Food and Drug Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="10313.628" offset="41357876">They were on the market as old drugs just like Aspirin.</text>
            <text syncTime="10318.981" offset="41379297">These products were generally recognized as safe for their recommended use and that's the basis on which they were brought on the market.</text>

            <text syncTime="10350.896" offset="41506983">It is a criminal offense under the act of marketing misbranded drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="10354.376" offset="41520880">The act defined misbranding to include the use of labeling which is false or misleading in any particular, and there was certainly no question that a false or misleading claim for effectiveness for a drug is a misbranding.</text>
            <text syncTime="10366.416" offset="41569050">The Government has never brought such an action against the products that are involved in this case, that would be the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="10375.630" offset="41605935">Now this was the only remedy available to the Food and Drug Administration for any product on the market as of 1962, if it believed that the product was not effective for its recommenced uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="10386.891" offset="41650970">However, when Congress amended the act to provide a degree of pre-marketing control over products, it did not apply that pre-marketing control retrospectively to products then on the market without qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="10401.477" offset="41709275">Instead it added a grandfather clause and it's the scope of that grandfather clause which is the crux of the controversy between USV Pharmaceutical Corporation and the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="10417.621" offset="41773850">The question as I said is which definition of new drug applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="10421.781" offset="41790464">The Grandfather Clause says, that if a product is a new drug under the new definition, it still may not be required to go through the pre-clearance requirement, if three conditions are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="10449.113" offset="41899865">Now this Section 107 (c) (4) is a technical and very precise statute and it's not the sort of provision which can be read impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="10457.187" offset="41932152">Congress spelt out its three criteria extremely carefully and we think a broad-brush treatment of the complex language it employed would not do justice to the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="10479.221" offset="42020237">Page 482 sets out Section 107 (c) (4) of the act and this is the first non-indented paragraph, a little bit below in the middle of the page and the three criteria are first that the product had been marketed in the United States prior to the enactment of the 1962 Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="10499.436" offset="42101112">There is no doubt that the products involved in this case were so marketed and that the products in this case therefore meet the first criterion for grandfather protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="10508.974" offset="42139251">The second requirement is that the product was not a new drug under the statute as it stood when the amendments were adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="10515.746" offset="42166314">That is that the product was then generally recognized by qualified experts as safe for its recommended uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="10522.870" offset="42194840">And the District Court found, and the Court of Appeals agreed that in 1962 the products involved in this case were generally recognized as safe for their recommended uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="10531.537" offset="42229530">That the products, therefore, were not new drugs when the statute was amended, so that the second criterion for grandfather status is also met.</text>
            <text syncTime="10539.620" offset="42261817">The third requirement for grandfather status is the one that brings us here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="10544.643" offset="42281984">That requirement is that the product was not covered by an effective application under Section 505 of the Act, the time the statute was amended and the controversy today is over the proper construction of this third criterion.</text>
            <text syncTime="10560.415" offset="42344991">In other words, I say, USV never filed an application under Section 505 for either of its two ''me-too'' products.</text>
            <text syncTime="10567.615" offset="42373831">This was because each was considered from the outset by USV to be generally recognized by qualified experts as safe for its intended uses, and therefore, was not a new drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="10577.112" offset="42411865">New drug applications were not required for such products and the marketing of each of these ''me-too'' products was initiated and continued on the strength general recognition of safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="10585.728" offset="42446242">That was the basis on which the products were marketed and it was the only basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="10589.850" offset="42462751">The Court of Appeals held in this case that products such as these meet literally the criteria for exemption stated in the grandfather clause, and this is at page 470 of the appendix, meet literally the criteria for exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="10601.947" offset="42511130">We agree, but the court went on to hold that USV's products in this category do not reach grandfather status, notwithstanding that they -- literally the requirements for invention because USV as the manufacturer was itself the applicant under the NDAs for early additions of the products which were first marketed under effective NDAs.</text>
            <text syncTime="10623.157" offset="42595976">We petitioned for certiorari to review the decision insofar as a true distinction on the basis of identity of the manufacturer and his role in the marketing other products, the Government agrees with us that no such distinction is supportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="10636.711" offset="42650206">The Government agrees, in other words, that if a product was a 'me-too' version of an earlier product, it matters not who the original manufacturer was, and the Government therefore agrees that our 'me-too' products will be treated just like everybody else's, but we differ as to what that treatment should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="10653.249" offset="42716348">The Government argues for affirmance of the judgment as to USV's products by attacking the Court of Appeals ruling as to never NDA 'me-too' products in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="10661.569" offset="42749680">The government argues that notwithstanding the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the products meet literally the criteria for exemption that they don't really qualify after all.</text>
            <text syncTime="10671.479" offset="42789282">So the question before this Court as to the 'me-too' products is the correction of the ruling below as modify in accordance with the Government's concession that Congress did confer grandfather status on never NDA products, even thought they were later versions of earlier products.</text>

            <text syncTime="10814.696" offset="43362200">The 'me-too' product came on the market because it was generally recognized as safe and therefore not a new drug under the 1938 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="10821.869" offset="43390830">It continues on the market today in USV’s view because while it would not meet the amended definition, so that it would require pre-clearance by FDA if the amended definition applied, our view is that the grandfather clause withholds the amended definition from this product that was on the market prior to 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="10846.644" offset="43489991">The correctness of the decision below as to these 'me-too' products is shown, we think by three principle considerations which have gone into in our brief and if I may briefly summarize; first, is the literal language of Clause (c) of Section 107 (c) (4) construed in accordance with Congress’s demonstrative understanding of that language and of the concepts it incorporates.</text>
            <text syncTime="10866.431" offset="43569089">That concept is the concept of an effective application under 505.</text>
            <text syncTime="10870.560" offset="43585599">Now the government says 505 is irrelevant in construing the grandfather clause, but it's not irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="10876.120" offset="43607855">How can it be irrelevant if Clause (c) says that one of the criteria for grandfather protection is whether the product was covered by an effective application under Section 505.</text>
            <text syncTime="10885.853" offset="43646830">So the critical question in terms of statutory language we think is what did Congress think, what it meant when it used the words effective application under Section 505.</text>
            <text syncTime="10896.585" offset="43689671">Now we think Congress was pretty clear as to what that meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="10899.397" offset="43700955">Our brief explains that it was explicitly called for the attention of Congress by Secretary Rebikoff that ineffective application under Section 505 was a one-trip ticket only.</text>
            <text syncTime="10911.197" offset="43748185">It was good for the manufacturer who filed the product and it was good only for the product for which that application was filed, not for anybody else's product and not for any other product of the same manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="10922.835" offset="43794683">Congress reflected its understanding of this concept in other provisions of the statute, which are discussed in our brief and while it did not address the subject of 'me-too' products directly at any time as the government points out; that is only to show simply that Congress may not have been aware that the statute it did enact would protect “me-toos,” but whether Congress was aware of it or not, this is the statute they enacted and our position is that when Congress set up as a criterion for grandfather protection, that the product not be covered by an effective application under Section 505 that the case has to be decided on the basis of what Congress thought was covered by an effective application under Section 505.</text>
            <text syncTime="10967.304" offset="43972629">The second consideration that we think militates in favor of the Court of Appeals ruling on these two products in general, is that the only available evidence of Congress’s purpose, in amending the definition of New Drug in the first place, shows a very limited purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="10982.993" offset="44035323">Remember, the grandfather provision controls the applicability of the amendment to that Section 201 (p) definition of a New Drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="10992.131" offset="44071894">So we believe that's relevant to inquire what was Congress’s purpose in amending the definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="10997.051" offset="44091538">The government has stated in its brief that they agree that there is only a limited evidence of purpose in the legislative history and that purpose was to clear up some confusion that was prevalent in the Senate at the time that the New Drug definition was amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="11018.920" offset="44179101">The purpose of the amendment was to ensure that new claims for our old products would be covered by the new definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="11030.110" offset="44223822">So that if Aspirin would have been newly recommended for acne, for example; to give examples when you used here this morning, then a New Drug Application would have to be filed for Aspirin insofar as it was being recommended for the new use, that was the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="11045.050" offset="44283591">That was the only purpose that is evidenced in the legislative history and we think that because 'me-too' products obviously have nothing to do with that purpose that the statute should not be distorted so as to deny these products, the grandfather status, which Congress literally and explicitly conferred on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="11063.960" offset="44359241">If the Court has no further questions, I would prefer to save the balance of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="11210.297" offset="44944593">Now there is an issue in some cases as there is in the Bentex case for instance, as to whether you may really be dealing with a different drug that is not the same drug that was covered by the New Drug Application, but the position of the agency and it has been explained in its drug efficacy study implementation regulations of October 1972 which we have cited in our brief, is basically that identical, similar or related products and this is defined by chemical composition and therapeutic use.</text>
            <text syncTime="11243.401" offset="45076982">It's a scientific concept which has parameters which I can’t really get into today and there can be factual issues as to whether a particular product is in the same generic family with the drug discovered by the NDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="11259.105" offset="45139780">Now, if Section 107(c)(4) is construed in the way USV urges in an individual product sense, the results are irrational; they are discriminatory among manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="11270.989" offset="45187323">They are completely disruptive of the congressional purpose and requiring that drugs be shown to be effective for their claim uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="11278.117" offset="45215848">Now let me give you scenario of what would happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="11281.179" offset="45228074">Sometime between 1938 and 1962, a manufacturer decides there are certain compound is useful for the treatment of a certain disease or condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="11290.057" offset="45263600">He does studies on regarding the safety of that compound and he files an application with FDA, which reviews his application and allows it to go into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="11299.179" offset="45300067">He then starts manufacturing that product.</text>
            <text syncTime="11302.199" offset="45312188">Now two or three or five other manufacturers may decide that they also want to market the same product and if it's not patent, they are free to do so except they have to file their own applications until such time as the drug comes to be generally recognized as safe, which it comes to be because there have been NDA products out on the market that are generically the same and at that point any manufacturer can market his product without going through the regulatory procedure and that includes the NDA holder who can put it out under different brand names or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="11338.977" offset="45459310">Now, the ratio of these 'me-too' products to the products that are named in the application is quite high.</text>
            <text syncTime="11346.672" offset="45490030">FDA has found that it's high as 13:1; in the Bentex case, we have 23 manufacturers of 'me-too' products and only two manufacturers who held NDA’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="11358.505" offset="45537364">Now under the 1962 amendments, Congress said review these NDA’s, determine the efficacy if these drugs and the agency does it and the agency finds under the standards that Congress has established that the drugs are ineffective or that they lack substantial evidence of effectiveness, which is somewhat different and it withdraws approval of the NDA’s and it takes the Pioneer drugs off the market and here are 20 other manufacturers, still on the market with the identical product sitting in the drug store shelves.</text>
            <text syncTime="11387.277" offset="45652511">Nothing has been accomplished for the consumer, nothing has been accomplished, but a completely irrational discrimination between identically situated people that does not correspond to any regulatory purpose that Congress had.</text>
            <text syncTime="11401.461" offset="45709249">Now, nothing in the legislative history indicates this was Congress's intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="11405.801" offset="45726595">Mr. Hoffman relies on something in part two of the senate report when he says that they were concerned with new claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="11413.108" offset="45755852">He omits in his brief and he omitted to mention in his argument, the closing sentence of that paragraph which says the effect of this amendment on drugs already on the market is discussed below under transitional provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="11426.022" offset="45807470">So that the paragraph on which he relies has nothing to do with the effect of the amendment of Section 201 on drugs already on the market in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="11441.058" offset="45867656">Now he says, well let's rely and the industry says, let's rely on the power of FDA as a prosecutor with the aid of the Department of Justice to go chasing these people in the courts with these very serious remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="11452.195" offset="45912168">And in our reply brief, we have tried to point out to the Court some of the practical problems that exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="11458.371" offset="45936828">But what I would like to point out to the court now, is that Congress when they passed the 1962 amendments expressed a concern with the inadequacy of the judicial remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="11469.354" offset="45980818">They said, even where the effectiveness, this is and I am quoting from the house report HR 24/64, page 3, which we have cited in our brief, “Even where the effectiveness of the new drug enters into determining its safety, the Food and Drug Administration cannot, if it finds the drug safe, refuse clearance because the claim of effectiveness is exaggerated,” that's under the old statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="11490.713" offset="46066186">“Rather the administration would have to stultify itself by allowing clearance and then causing court action to be brought for mis-branding.”</text>
            <text syncTime="11499.392" offset="46100982">Committee goes on to note “as a result of good medical practice is hampered and the consumer is mislead until perhaps years later the government has gathered the necessary evidence to sustain its burden of proving the violation in courts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="11512.966" offset="46155212">That is what Congress was concerned about, when it sought to bring these drugs under the regulatory scheme for evaluation of drug ethics.</text>

            <text syncTime="11622.596" offset="46593755">Mr. Frey has said quite correctly that Section 107 (c) (4), page 482, refers to a drug rather than to a product, but that doesn't advance ball any in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="11636.967" offset="46651225">He says that, 201 (p) is generic and therefore 107 (c) (4) must be generic.</text>
            <text syncTime="11643.301" offset="46676616">But again he stressed, that as the government did in its brief, it just ignores the fact that in carving out an exemption from the applicability of the amended definition which is generic, Congress made that exemption turn on a highly personal and particularized factor, namely was the drug, now Mr. Frey said in the statute where it was the drug covered by ineffective application.</text>
            <text syncTime="11667.442" offset="46773164">Now if Mr. Frey is right and a drug is covered by an effective application and if any member of its generic class is covered then once the first NDA is approved, nobody else need to file a new drug application because Section 505 (a), the basic statutory requirement and this is on page 477, 505 (a) says, “No person shall introduce or deliver any new drug unless an approval of an application filed pursuant to sub-section (b) is effective with respect to such drug.”</text>
            <text syncTime="11701.675" offset="46910046">Now if the word drug is generic than its generic.</text>
            <text syncTime="11704.335" offset="46920704">If it's personal, it's personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="11706.707" offset="46930213">We pointed out in our reply brief, that what makes the 201 (p) definition generic is the rather awkward phrasing, that a new drug is any drug, the composition of which is such that it is not generally recognized by experts.</text>
            <text syncTime="11724.247" offset="47000325">Now that's not found anywhere in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="11726.505" offset="47009416">107, except 201 (p), the grandfather clause doesn't say that a product is disqualified from grandfather status.</text>
            <text syncTime="11736.756" offset="47050376">If it's a product, the composition of which is such that is covered by a new application, and so we therefore rest on the proposition that Congress enacted a statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="11758.270" offset="47136475">Mr. Hoffman, the essence of your position, if I understand it is that this regulatory scheme depends largely if not entirely on criminal sanctions in the district court, where the burden of proof is on the government beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="11772.409" offset="47193004">Now, is there any other regulatory scheme of this general character, in which that burden is placed on the regulatory agency?</text>

            <text syncTime="11782.524" offset="47233442">We think, there are not regulatory schemes that are precisely like this, in the respect to which Your Honor refers. I am not a securities lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="11791.441" offset="47269177">My understanding, however is that, for example, if a person violates the securities act, by failing to comply with registration requirements, and like the principal remedy, and I am just not certain if it's the only one, but the principal remedies inaction in the district courts, and the action I might add, need not be criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="11810.434" offset="47345142">The government has civil remedies available.</text>
            <text syncTime="11812.735" offset="47354337">It can cease the products, it can enjoin with the civil burden of preponderance of evidence burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="11818.653" offset="47377951">And as far as the necessity of bringing thousands of suits is concerned, we think the history of the regulatory statute in question shows that where a point is established, if it has relevance to other cases, it need not be litigated thousands of times.</text>

            <text syncTime="11852.373" offset="47512848">I do have an answer, Mr. Justice Blackmun, if I may state just briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="11857.408" offset="47533014">The Congress continued in courts usually as to the products that were on market in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="11864.995" offset="47563316">Whatever regulatory scheme was then in courts as to that product, if a product was being regulated, as a new drug, and actively regulated, then it would continue to be so regulative under the amended schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="11878.308" offset="47616606">If it wasn't being regulated under the administrative new drug scheme, which is traditional to 'me-too', that it continued not to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="11886.714" offset="47650252">Now this may be seen as unfair and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association have suggested that in fact anti-aid products, which would become no longer in use, are not subject to the amended definition of new drug either.</text>
            <text syncTime="11902.954" offset="47715140">That issue is present in our case, with a refinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="11907.176" offset="47732067">We are in position of -- as the District Court found having withdrawn the applications from FDA, but that is an entirely a separate issue, which they simply haven't been timed to discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="11919.844" offset="47782745">We think in other words this is not anomalous anymore than any grandfather clause is anomalous, that distinguishes between products in various regulatory statuses when statute is amended, but if there is an anomaly; it's for Congress, and not for this Court to adjudicate.</text>
