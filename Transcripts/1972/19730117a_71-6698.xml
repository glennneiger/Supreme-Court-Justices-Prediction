            <label>Mr. E. R. McClelland</label>
            <text syncTime="61.048" offset="347512">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.182" offset="360051">I am going to be remised if I did not first convey my appreciation to the great honorable clerk and his staff for their assistance to us in this matter, they are very nice.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.396" offset="412923">The facts in this case as I understand are not in dispute by any of the parties here.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.321" offset="448658">So I’ll be very brief and cite only those things that are considered pertinent to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.326" offset="484707">One that in the year 1957, Mr. Morris qualified for and started receiving social security benefits, but in the year 1965 Linda Gayle Kinder was born and a few months after that was sent to the home of the grandparents.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.196" offset="580106">In this case Mr. Morris and resided with them continuously thereafter until the present time as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.203" offset="628172">That in October of 1966 Mr. Morris and his wife adopted Linda Gayle.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.189" offset="676133">But in 1968 there was a reapplication for social security benefits by Mr. Morris on behalf of Linda Gayle which were -- and what is an issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.112" offset="731826">The pertinent parts of the Social Security Act that we talk about today, one has to do with Section 202 (d) (1) and (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="173.215" offset="796191">These are the ones that setup eligibility for children.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.686" offset="822105">The one here states that a child shall be entitled to benefits, if this child is living in the home of the petitioner and that he is contributing more than at least 51% of the support and so forth to the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.198" offset="884172">Section 3 has to do with eligibility and again Linda Gayle is qualified under that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.049" offset="919594">All provisions in that Section starts out saying that “Shall be deemed to be dependent” this has to do with the Dependency Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.432" offset="969122">Another one in issue here is 202 (d) (8).</text>
            <text syncTime="223.607" offset="997752">1960, when the Social Security Act was relative to dependency a lot and this was first passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.069" offset="1023666">Congress saw fit to give benefits to children born of qualified social security recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.481" offset="1073298">Subsequent to that and shortly after they put in the section pertaining to adopted children, if the child lived in the home of the petitioner of the recipient at least one year prior to the time that he shall have reached his old age or, disability or what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.713" offset="1178206">In 1967, subsequent to the date of the adoption of Linda Gayle, Congress amended this particular Section and put in this 202 (d) (8).</text>
            <text syncTime="286.488" offset="1249364">And they started talking about children adopted by an eligible beneficiary recipient.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.320" offset="1284681">And here the key one in which we are interested today upon which this Court accepted this case has to do with child placement.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.767" offset="1334418">Congress said that “If a child can on the adoption, at the adoption proceeding was supervised or was handled through a public or private child placement agency then this adopted child could qualify for benefits.”</text>
            <text syncTime="330.474" offset="1425220">I might also add here that on October the 30th of 1972, that Congress again amended this Section 202 (d) (8) and we’re now back to where we were in 1960 which means that unless a child shall have lived in the home of the petitioner for not less than one year prior to the time that he reaches eligibility for old age assistance or the date that he would become eligible for request for disability benefits that the child cannot qualify.</text>

            <text syncTime="511.669" offset="2150066">In other words, she applied for benefits under this new Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.792" offset="2166575">In February of 1968, the year that that particular Section went into effect I think in January or December -- January ’67.</text>

            <text syncTime="790.243" offset="3264345">I will say that here in addition to this, the case of Haggler against Finch which was relied on by the Fourth Circuit and their holding in this case together with the strong alliance on the part of the respondent and his brief here.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.611" offset="3361834">There is a little statement in that court opinion that I would like to read to the Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.524" offset="3429439">In Haggler case of course, this Court denied certiorari, but after having admitted that this child, there was no abuse involved, so far as the adoption of this child was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.173" offset="3492028">The Court said this, “The Hagglers lacking guidance through the statutory of 402 (d) have wondered in to a trap design to snare only the undeserving.</text>

Supp. 588 it was.</text>

            <text syncTime="940.423" offset="3865057">One, the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits as to the federal government statutes creating arbitrary discriminations which have no rational basis and legitimate governmental purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.128" offset="3919914">And two that although Congress has great latitude to make classifications in the area of economic and welfare legislation, a provision must have some rational basis or be pertinent to some proper objective of Congress in order to withstand challenge under the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.381" offset="3996923">Your Honor, the fact that Congress has seen fit to deny after adopted children which they have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.546" offset="4037569">The benefits that are now accruing to those children that have been previously adopted or children that will be born to the social security recipients subsequent to his receiving benefits, I think falls decidedly within this classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.186" offset="4140074">And when Congress considered of this thing, in reading the Congressional record on what they had to say, now Senator Allen got into the question of “Will these calls abuse?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.935" offset="4203081">And calls individuals to go out and adopt children to supplement their own income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.942" offset="4235160">The two things I would like to mention on that Senator Curtis also had some observations on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.785" offset="4262536">One of them is, they checked the actuarial expert there and he came back and said, “Well look, there would be maybe a fraction of 1% involved, should we grant full benefits to these adopted children.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.849" offset="4354800">They admitted on the floor that they each knew of personal cases where it seemed unjust to not give these individuals a privilege of being entitled to these benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1733.482" offset="7037262">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I think that a short review of the development of the provision dealing with benefits for adopted children may be helpful in assessing both whether there are issues which ought to be decided now despite the repeal of the disputed provision after certiorari was granted and also in the merits of those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.628" offset="7129840">Before 1960, child’s benefits were not payable unless the child was born or adopted prior to the wage earners disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.241" offset="7164322">In 1960, the Act was amended to permit payment to natural children born after the disability and also to adopted children who were adopted within two years of the disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.149" offset="7215940">If the adoption proceedings had been started prior to the disability or the child was already living with the wage earner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.170" offset="7256064">Petitioner was not entitled to the benefits under that 1960 provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.754" offset="7274350">And the idea of the 1960 provision stated in the committee reports was to assure that benefits will be paid to such children only when there is a basis for assuming that the child lost the source of support when the worker became disabled or died.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.116" offset="7347806">And further, the Congress said that it's purpose was to guard against abuse to adoption of children solely to qualify them for benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.784" offset="7382497">Both in our view are perfectly proper concerns of Congress and the question is whether the later 68 provision bears a rational relationship to those concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.053" offset="7427636">Now as we’ll also see, the relative emphasis Congress has given these considerations has changed over the years and particularly between the 68 and 72 provisions, this is one reason that we disagree that the constitutional issue would be the same under the 72 Amendments as it is under the 1968 Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.473" offset="7533275">And therefore, this is one reason we don’t think that this broad issue is appropriate for decision now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.294" offset="7564518">Now, in 1968 Congress liberalized the provision of Section 202 dealing with adopted children disability beneficiaries by providing benefits for not only those whose adoption was contemplated at the time of disability, but after adopted children who met certain tests particularly that the adoption be court decreed and that it be supervised by a Child Placement Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.641" offset="7681964">It was felt that those two requirements would provide adequate protection against adoptions for the purpose of obtaining benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.991" offset="7711326">Well, they would cover certain hard cases which had arisen under the old provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.230" offset="7732328">I will be noted that this 1968 provision somewhat departed from the earlier idea that the statute should aim only at taking care of children who lost their source of support when the wage earner was disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.671" offset="7790007">But the 72 Amendments moved back in that direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.473" offset="7805262">They still allow benefits based on a later court decreed adoption irrespective of the time the court decrees the adoption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.517" offset="7841416">But they do so only when the child lost the source of support because his parent retired or became disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.328" offset="7880704">That is, they provide that the child must have been living with the wage earner for a year prior to the disability in receiving at least half the support from the wage earner.</text>

            <label>Mr. Walter H. Fleischer</label>
            <text syncTime="2319.952" offset="9383163">Well, I don’t know that there is any basis for the supposition in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.545" offset="9413569">In the second place, assuming that the number is small, the fact that legislation does not cover every case to which its rationale should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.667" offset="9466023">I don’t believe there’s a basis for a constitutional invalidation under such decisions of this Court as Jefferson versus Hackney and McGallan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.734" offset="9506356">Now, I believe both of the petitioner’s constitution arguments depend heavily on the criticism of the Congressional determination that it ought to guard against adoptions for the purpose of obtaining benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.653" offset="9569991">I’d like to give a practical common place illustration and why this danger is inherent in this situation of post disability adoptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.235" offset="9608338">Let’s suppose for example both a grandparent, and an aunt and uncle of the child are considering adopting the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.462" offset="9649194">And let’s suppose that in the particular case the aunt and uncle might be able to better educate the child and provide him a home with children his age and for other reasons might be a more suitable home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.534" offset="9697468">Now, if the grandparents are responsible and upstanding citizens, they may well pass the state adoption test and their petition might be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.787" offset="9734562">But Congress recently might not want this decision influenced by the desire to get additional social security benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.271" offset="9764446">So it is not only the case of the crass attempt to use a child which is protective against behind the adoption by placement agency case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.541" offset="9817527">But in addition, situation such as I have described and allowing benefits in the case of post disability adoptions only where a court decreed the adoption and the adoption is supervised by a placement agency, is a very rational way of being sure that the motivation isn’t social security benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.755" offset="9922435">But instead the one specified by the state’s adoption laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.625" offset="9941870">Now, if this is so, is brought home by a decision of the New Mexico’s Supreme Court which we cite at page 18 of our brief (inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.043" offset="9983561">This was a grandparent case, and in that case, it was only because the State Welfare Agency pursued the case all the way up to the highest court of the land that in adoption for the purpose of obtaining social security benefits was stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.792" offset="10066526">Now, of course the petitioner is going to urge the Congressional evidence in avoiding this kind of situation is excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.398" offset="10104978">There’s really no way of knowing statistically how often it occurs, or the Congress was too cautious and bent over too far backward in having social security considerations intrude into the state adoption process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.771" offset="10158477">But we would submit that those arguments ought to be directed to another branch of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.410" offset="10185017">And they don’t show the irrationality of the test Congress set up or its lack of relationship to the goals of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.894" offset="10222947">Now, to be sure that this classification may not be perfect and that this particular case may show that it isn’t, there would seem to be some difficulties and also however, in what appeared to be the principal available alternatives, either reducing the protection of both children and the public, or having the Social Security Hearing Examiner try to decide the subjective motivation of the adoptive parents on the case by case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.951" offset="10367143">Furthermore, an after born natural child is not situated identically to a post disability adoptee and has the distinction as proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.582" offset="10421687">First, the possibility of the subordination of the child’s interest aren’t present in the case of the natural born child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.380" offset="10456900">And second, in terms of the wage earner -- the loss of the wage earner’s support there may be a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.268" offset="10484485">In the case of a natural child later conceived, it can’t be assumed that the conception was based on a decision which considered the ability to support the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.105" offset="10551777">However, if there is a later adoption, we can assume that the adopting court would not issue the decree if there were not an ability to support the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.003" offset="10623352">Finally, I would close by saying that we would consider the attack in the child placement supervision requirement as it applies to the particular situation in West Virginia due to the lack of the agency in some counties a little wide off the mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.526" offset="10689494">Again, it seems directed to showing that the Act created an inequity in this individual situation, which isn’t sufficient to invalidate the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.013" offset="10735470">But, moreover the distinction flows from the fact that Congress addressed the problem in the 1968 in the perspective fashion and didn’t say that they draw prior adoptions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2742.940" offset="11075166">However, one thing is clear and that is that West Virginia does not like to revoke in adoption already granted and I think it would be difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.833" offset="11130755">But the law doesn’t directly address the point.</text>
