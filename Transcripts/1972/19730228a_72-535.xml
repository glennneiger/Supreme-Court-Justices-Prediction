            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="50.122" offset="303835">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.027" offset="315434">These cases are here on appeal from the decision of a three-judge court, in the district court for the district of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.222" offset="352214">The suit was brought there to set aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission and it involves questions under the Interstate Commerce Act, the National Environmental Policy Act and other interrelated questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.695" offset="418147">I am representing the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission and Mr. Cox is representing the appellant railroads in number 72-562.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.715" offset="478229">We have filed separate briefs, but there is no diversions between our positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.007" offset="511352">The setting of the stage for this case began in December 1971, when the nation's railroads requested special permission from the Interstate Commerce Commission to authorize on short notice, a two-and-a-half percent surcharge on nearly all freight rates across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.008" offset="591391">They asked that this be affective on January 1, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.762" offset="614379">The Commission disallowed this request on the ground that there was inadequate notice, but it allowed the carriers to refile the proposal to be affective on not less than 30 days notice, and the carriers did refile on January 5, 1972 asking that the two-and-half-percent surcharge become affective on February 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.294" offset="732557">Under Section 3 of the Interstate Commerce Act, a rate proposed by a carrier becomes affective unless the Commission suspends it within 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.580" offset="785742">And this suspension pending on investigation under Section 15(7) is effective for a maximum period of seven months after which the carrier may put the rate into affect unless the Commission prior to that date has completed its investigation and affirmatively found that the proposed rate is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.508" offset="897442">In this case, during the 30-day period protests were filed by shippers and other interested parties and environmental groups, including the named appellee here, SCRAP opposed the surcharge on the ground that the prevailing rates structure discourages the movement of recyclable goods and that an across-the-board surcharge would further discourage recycling.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.325" offset="1024711">The Commission found that the railroads had a critical need for additional revenue and concluded that the proposed surcharge should not be suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.018" offset="1071417">It ordered the carriers, however, to publish permanent increased rates no later than June 5, 1972 and provided that the authority to collect the two-and-half percent surcharge would expire on that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.435" offset="1145083">The Commission also specifically found that the temporary surcharge would appear to have no significant adverse effect on the environment within the meaning of the Environmental Policy Act and there was evidence before the Commission to support that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.417" offset="1237034">The carriers then filed proposed selective increases averaging 4.1% and protests were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.936" offset="1275068">On April 24, 1972, the Commission instituted an investigation into the lawfulness of the selective increases and suspended them for the statutory seven month period under section 15(7).</text>
            <text syncTime="311.134" offset="1347897">At the same time it authorized the railroads to continue to collect the two-and-half percent surcharge until the end of the suspension period which was November 30, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.011" offset="1403382">A few days later on May 12, 1972 this suit was files by SCRAP and on June 1st, The Environmental Defense Fund and other environmental groups intervened as plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.616" offset="1473808">Various defenses to the suit were advanced, but these were rejected by the District Court and on July 10, 1972 that court added an injunction by which the Interstate Commerce Commission is restrained from permitting the railroads to collect the surcharge and the railroads are enjoined from collecting it insofar as it relates to goods being transported for purposes of recycling.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.964" offset="1603271">As a result, surcharge is now being collected on recyclable materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.977" offset="1635244">I have stated the basic facts without bringing in the legal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.922" offset="1659068">These are numerous and somewhat intertwined.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.982" offset="1679339">Questions relating to the Interstate Commerce Act and the procedures of the Commission will be presented by Mr. Cox.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.742" offset="1714343">I would like to repeat though that there is no difference between our positions either in substance or approach and I want to claim the benefit of any argument that he will make.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="428.845" offset="1818728">The first issue in the case to which I will turn is the familiar question of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.935" offset="1855091">We have a rather remarkable situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.448" offset="1877138">Five law school students though I am told they are changing groups, some of them have graduated and some others have taken their places, but I understand there are still five, proceeding not as lawyers, but as plaintiffs though not as tax payers, have tied up all the railroads in the country and with aid of the district court have prevented the railroads from collecting from $500,000 to $1,000,000 a month for the past eight months on shipments of recyclable materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.984" offset="2023320">They have been joined by several environmental groups, but the latter make no different allegations and the case may be treated on the basis of the position relied on by SCRAP.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.004" offset="2079431">Just last Thursday, the district court did grant a motion to intervene by the associate -- national Association of Secondary Industries, Inc, which is an organization which has filed a brief amicus curiae in this Court, the light green a brief amicus curiae.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.246" offset="2176397">Now, the order wasn't filed with the clerk until Friday and we didn't hear about it until Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.598" offset="2205759">I don't think that has any relation to the case which is pending before the Court on appeal and in any event insofar as these people are shippers, they would appear to be clearly are not entitled to the equitable relief which is the only thing involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.504" offset="2281409">After all, this is an appeal from the granting of a preliminary injunction because they would have a plain and adequate remedy at law by way of review of the rate order of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.912" offset="2338983">The allegations of SCRAP appear at pages 8 to 10 of the appendix, particularly on page, the bottom half of page 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.203" offset="2404185">They allege that each member of SCRAP, although we have now some new members who apparently have not formally joined in this petition, each member of SCRAP has been caused to pay more for finished products purchased in the marketplace, made more expensive by both non-use of recycle materials on their manufacture and the need to use comparatively more energy and the reduction of a raw material to finished the products and two uses, the forests, rivers, streams, mountains and other natural resources surrounding the Washington Metropolitan area and at his legal residence for camping, hiking, fishing, site-seeing and other recreational or aesthetic purposes and passing to the third has been and continue to be exposed to the quality of the air within the Washington Metropolitan area and their legal residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.049" offset="2639600">Now, it will be seen that these allegations are entirely general.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.070" offset="2659662">It is not said, which forests, rivers, streams or mountain?</text>
            <text syncTime="643.655" offset="2677948">We don't even have a particular valley as we did in the Mineral King case last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.471" offset="2705220">Which forest, stream, river or mountain is used by any members SCRAP, it is obvious that these allegations could be made by any member of the public, who wishes to make.</text>

            <text syncTime="664.721" offset="2762271">The District Court not only didn't take testimony, but there is no evidence to support their standing and the position of SCRAP in their motion that dismiss is that such evidence was unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.374" offset="2836877">District Court didn't require any proof, even of these allegations and quoting from their motion to affirm, SCRAP said that proof of its injuries is unnecessary for purpose of standing and it also said that it was a and I am quoting that it was obvious, that is their word, that SCRAP could not and I quote, “prove the amount of additional pollution in the Washington D.C. area created by the latest ICC railroad rate increase.”</text>

            <text syncTime="717.274" offset="2972505">The shippers whose rates were increased would have standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.401" offset="2992985">I am not sure that anyone would have standing to obtain an injunction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.531" offset="3021511">That is a question which interrelates with the Interstate Commerce Commission argument that Mr. Cox is going to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.083" offset="3063724">There are those who feel that standing is no longer a relevant argument, though I wonder if our predecessors were always that wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.810" offset="3106565">In another case, Judge Gisele in this district, nearly two years ago said, in recent years, the Supreme Court has greatly expanded the concept of standing and in this circuit, the concept has now been almost completely abandoned and similarly in a recent article in the Cincinnati Law review, the author concludes with this statement, “the law would be so much better if the courts got directly on with the task of deciding the merits of the claims presented without passing on the merits of the plaintiff presenting them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="790.208" offset="3264240">Now, there is a certain simple appeal in that and it may represent the wave of the future, but it is a serious step, the implications of which should be carefully explored and considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.413" offset="3329024">Before going further, I may observe that if there is standing in this case, it would be helpful, I think and a contribution to candor, if this Court would indicate that standing is no longer required, for to say that standing is required and that there is standing in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="892.645" offset="3673945">As, for example, a person who owns a piece of land and in violation of an environmental statute, his view is going to be obstructed, even though it might not have a -- it just happened to be a sentimental view that he had reason to like, but it affects him.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.281" offset="3740505">It isn't something that deals with the public in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.805" offset="3766627">Standing is not a fiction and never has been and should not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.863" offset="3786794">If anyone has standing to bring a suit like this, it will mark a substantial shift in the balance under our traditional and constitutional separation of powers where this is what the Constitution meant by cases or controversies, to which the judicial power is extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.142" offset="3863907">If everyone is a Private Attorney General, free to raise any public question at his whim or because of his academic or abstract interest, more and more questions will be thrown into the courts and we can readily have a situation where every facet of our governmental operation depends on the later hindrance of the courts wherein affect the courts would take over all the details of the administration of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.764" offset="3978428">In my view, that would not be good for the courts and it would not be good for the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.634" offset="4001938">Perhaps, more pertinent, it is not the the sort of division of function which was intended by the framers as I see it, when they established the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.915" offset="4043003">I don't want to argue another case, but this Court last Monday granted certiorari in United States against Richardson, which is a clear illustration of the type of question which will arise if there is standing in a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.395" offset="4112906">It may seem very fine to some today to have the courts decide all the legal questions, often pretty much in advance and in the absence of concrete facts as is the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.543" offset="4173511">For the courts today are progressive and forward looking and innovative, but it has not always been so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.537" offset="4205484">There have been times when the courts were felt by way and be backward looking and obstructive and serious attacks on the courts have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.098" offset="4243728">Of course, the court should do their duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.190" offset="4256162">They should exercise a judicial power without fear or favor, but the judicial power does not authorize a general overriding sort of oversight of all legal questions arising in the government, a sort of ombudsman to whom all may resort when they feel so impelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.616" offset="4341844">It was for this reason that the judicial power was extended to cases of controversies and that should mean bona fide disputes by a party who has a real stake and who can show how he has been hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.586" offset="4401716">That is not this case with respect to any of the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.554" offset="4425540">I turn now to one of the substantive questions in this case, namely the proper interpretation of the National Environmental Policy Act and its application to the action of the ICC which has been enjoined here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.953" offset="4499205">We start with the procedure long established by the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.964" offset="4523238">As indicated in the previous case and as I have said, the Commission is given broad power to suspend, propose rates but it has only 30 days within which to take this action and under Section 15(7), it has only seven months after suspension to act on the proposed rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.968" offset="4611218">If the Commission has not acted within seven months, the new rates go into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.621" offset="4641834">On January 1, 1970, the President signed the National Environmental Policy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.540" offset="4669524">This is obviously a statute to great importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.815" offset="4682585">Establishing a clearly stated public policy and it is obviously to be taken seriously by all agencies of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.868" offset="4722813">It was enacted in sweeping, but rather general terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.179" offset="4744129">The Act established a Council on Environmental Quality with explicit duties in the areas of research and investigation into environmental quality and the Council has issued guidelines under the Act, which are set out at pages 43 to 54 of our brief, but the Council has no administrative responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.498" offset="4841409">It decides no cases and issues no orders to agencies or parties and there is no provision in the statute for judicial review of any action or non-action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.646" offset="4893968">I am not suggesting that there can't be judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.990" offset="4911313">I am merely observing that the statute though sweeping, is not particularly articulated, is cast in very general terms and obviously requires some construing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.592" offset="4969723">When we look at the environment statute itself, Section 102 C, 1022 C, which is on page 42 of our brief, we find that it applies to legislative proposals which are not involved here and then the keywords are Major Federal Action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.147" offset="5088005">If Major Federal Actions, if they are ones “significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.386" offset="5120920">Thus, we have at the threshold two phrases which require the consideration of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.015" offset="5147460">There is another phrase at the beginning of Section 102 that I will mention later to the fullest extent possible and it seems to me in large measures this part of this case turns on the construction which this Court gives to those three phrases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.945" offset="5219140">There is nothing in the statute which limits these phrases to any particular agencies or types of agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.415" offset="5249024">For example, literally, the statutes applies to decisions of this Court and if so, after all this Court is a federal agency and if this Court takes an action, it then well be a Major Federal Action, if so construed, would require the Court to issue an environmental impact statement after consulting all interested federal agencies before making any decision which could the affect the environment and under the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality, this process could take at least four months and probably a good year longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.250" offset="5408371">As I have said, what this Court does is often Major Federal Action and what it does may affect the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.105" offset="5439822">For example, this Court's decision in this case or in last term, Sierra Club case or in a case involving school busing, might as least arguably has a significant environmental affect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.150" offset="5491963">Now, I hasten to make it plain that I don't think that the statute should be construed to apply to the decisions of this Court, but I do suggest that reaching that result takes some construing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.540" offset="5545566">In the light of the whole setting, it is right and sound, I think that to conclude that by the words, Major Federal Actions in the statute, Congress did not mean to include decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.857" offset="5598751">Though there is no definition of a federal agency or anything like that which excludes this Court, even though, they are obviously federal action and may often be major.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.312" offset="5644622">If the statute is susceptible to such a limitations and I think it is and must be, then it becomes necessary to consider the statute in its application in other set of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.254" offset="5696345">Our submission is that as a matter of statutory construction, the National Environmental Policy Act was not intended to displace the Interstate Commerce Act when the application of NEPA is not feasible in the light of the scheme for prompt action established by the Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.911" offset="5794983">Now, this result requires no straining of the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.596" offset="5813791">For Section 102 itself starts out with the provision that the policies of NEPA are to be applied to the fullest extent possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.146" offset="5847960">Where as a practical matter, the application of the NEPA procedures is not possible because of the time limitations and the operative statutes, NEPA should not be construed to require.</text>

            <text syncTime="1692.537" offset="6873527">The Commission has, it has to consider suspension orders in approximately 4000 cases a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.934" offset="6907068">The Commission was obviously confronted with the task of determining its duty in the light of the two statutes taken together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.611" offset="6937788">By its own terms, NEPA is applicable only to actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment and in this case, the Commission made a specific finding that the proposed across the board temporary surcharge, “will have no significant adverse effect on the quality of the human environment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.756" offset="7042382">The Court below said that this finding appears to be no more than glorified border play.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.653" offset="7065997">Perhaps, it did not adequately recognized the Commission's experience in the field, nor its standing as a co-ordinating agency of the government seeking to comply with its duty under provision to two statutes which are surely not wholly clear in their interrelations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.053" offset="7139558">Now, it is obvious that NEPA can't be complied with fully within 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.821" offset="7166621">The appellees suggest that since the enactment of NEPA, the Commission should always suspend new rates until an environmental impact statement has been prepared and filed but as the Second Circuit had pointed out, sometimes suspension has environmental implications.</text>

            <text syncTime="1932.943" offset="7835146">If I have any time, I shall try to sat something about that otherwise, I shall have to submit it on the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.984" offset="7863359">But for the present, I am making these assumptions and our point is that on those assumptions, the court would have been entitled to set aside these orders and to remand the case to the Commission with directions to the Commission to comply with the court's statement of the law and the Commission would have been oblige to do so, but the court did not have authority to suspend the rates itself or compel the Commission to suspend them or to enjoin the railroads from collecting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.848" offset="8014764">Now, this is a point of great practical importance to the rail transportation system of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.884" offset="8046947">This injunction as has been said has caused and will continue to cause substantial revenue loss for the railroads and particularly to the railroads in the north-eastern part of the United States who are disabled to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.814" offset="8102640">But beyond those immediate consequences it has general consequences which are far more serious, because it is an assertion of power on the part of a district court to enjoin rates when the Commission is declined to do so in any case involved in environmental issue to enjoin the railroads from collecting the rates although the rates have never been determined to the be unlawful and what is more to do these things without paying any attention to the seven months limitation on suspension orders that is specifically described in the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2041.629" offset="8269928">Well, if you take it from the time that the Commission itself could have suspended the rates I think that time expired in, I think, on 5th of September.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.532" offset="8321546">If you take it from the time that the district court, and I wouldn't think this is proper, but if you take from the time the district court enjoined the rates, they have been enjoin suspended more than seven months because that period expired about the 15th of this month, So anyway you look at it, whatever, however you do treat the dates, these rates have been suspended as a result of the district court's injunction for more than seven months and there was no limitation in the injunction at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.830" offset="8438680">Now, this point is -- the practical importance of this situation lies in fact that the most -- one of the most difficult and constant problems that the railroads of this country have had for 25 years is the lag, this time lag that exist between the time when they must pay increased costs and time when they can partially offset those costs by increasing the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.287" offset="8564485">Now, some time lag is inevitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.035" offset="8575561">The railroads have to endure it because it is imposed upon them by the Interstate Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.609" offset="8597817">They have to give 30 days notice unless the Commission released them from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.454" offset="8613177">The Commission can suspend the rates for seven months and that loss is irreparable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.468" offset="8633240">The railroads can't do anything about it, but the railroads are gravely disturbed by any judicial alteration of the regulatory plan of the Interstate Commerce Act which increases that delay and increases the time lag and I think some figures about this present proceeding are pertinent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.145" offset="8727907">In 19 – at the end of 1971 when the railroads initiated this, tried to initiate this rate increase, at that time and since the last time they had raised their rates generally, their costs had increased by one billion dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.455" offset="8813171">Most of that cost is in labor cost and payroll taxes on wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.265" offset="8836472">In the time which this very proceeding has been pending today, those costs have been increased by another billion dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.847" offset="8878791">Now, if the railroads had been able, which they were not, to lay their hands on the revenue, the entire revenue that they hoped to obtain from the rate increase, the general rate increase that is involved which was about 350 million dollars, if they had been able to raise – lay their hands on that at the very beginning of this proceeding, it would have been only a partial offset about 25% of these increased costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.516" offset="8993416">I think against that background the court can understand why is this situation is a concern to the railroads and is a concern to the rail transportation system of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.310" offset="9040645">Because the railroads need this revenue, they need it to provide the services which improve their services and maintain their services to prevent diversion of traffic to truck, which the appellees says himself and have environmental consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.795" offset="9110549">They needed matter of fact to put their own environmental projects on which they spend a great deal of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.232" offset="9160286">The conclusion, the practical situation that is created by this assertion of judicial authority, I point out to the Court is a serious one because it is not -- its limited, you can say its limited to cases involving environmental issues, but that limitation does reduce its practical significance because of arguments that the appellees here show, the arguments they made before the Commission a claim of environmental affects can be based on any adjustment in rail rates on the ground that it diverts traffic to trucks and even these recycle commodities involve a great range of commodities and they are commodities that involved in litigation not only in these general rate increase cases but involved limited and specific cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2828.515" offset="11417475">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.847" offset="11430745">Every year this nation produces more than four billion tons of solid refuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.320" offset="11456658">Only a very small fraction of this scrap was recycled even though most of it is capable of being recycled and reused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.959" offset="11495215">Railroad freight rates which are authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission are a major factor discouraging recycling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.396" offset="11528965">This is what this case is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.782" offset="11542549">I will address myself primarily to the issue of the Commission's failure to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act to the fullest extent possible, prior to April 24th audit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.949" offset="11595212">Mr. Dienelt will address the other issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.207" offset="11612244">On January 1st 1970, the date NEPA became effective, a national policy was established to protect the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.973" offset="11655293">All agencies were required in the strongest language to consider environmental values in their decision-making procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.626" offset="11693850">In section 101 (B) (6) of the Act, Congress specifically focused on the recycling problem and declared that it was the responsibility of all federal agencies to “enhance the quality of renewable resources and approach the maximum attainable recycling of depletable resources.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.478" offset="11785279">In the three years that NEPA has been in effect, the Commission has failed totally to fulfill this duty to encourage recycling and has refused to implement the procedural obligations of Section 102 (2) (C) of the Act requiring a preparation of environmental impact statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.070" offset="11867617">The Commission has granted three general rate increases on a recyclable materials since 1970, this case is the third, without ever making a detailed assessment of their environmental impact, without attempting to accommodate its procedures to the requirements of NEPA and without proposing any legislative measures to the President pursuant to section 103 of the Act to bring the Commission's procedure into conformity with NEPA, if there were any contrasts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.167" offset="11996035">It is hard to imagine a case where both the counsel on environmental quality and the Environmental Protection Agency have more strongly protested an agency's implementation of NEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.232" offset="12048280">These letters to the Commission in this and prior proceedings are in the record before the District Court and are on Appendix before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.210" offset="12088195">It is SCRAP's position that compliance with Section 102 (2) (C) of NEPA to the fullest extent possible required the Commission to prepare a draft environmental impact statement prior to its April 24th suspension order in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.614" offset="12161860">We do not necessarily seek and the District Court specifically refused to hold more generally that a draft impact statement is always required before the Commission makes its suspension decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.112" offset="12219852">The District Court's language to this affect is quoted on page 20 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.665" offset="12242004">Section 102 (2( (C) of the Act requires the preparation of a detailed environmental impact statement, prior to agency action, involving as the Solicitor pointed out, a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.232" offset="12312325">Copies of the statement quoting the language of Section 102 and I quote again, “shall accompany the proposal through the existing agency review process.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.740" offset="12354330">The clear objective of the impact statement requirement is to build into the decision making process a careful and thorough assessment of the potential environmental dangers of and alternatives to agency action and to assist the agencies in implementing the policies declared in Section 101 of the Act specifically, including the duty to encourage recycling.</text>

            <text syncTime="3088.108" offset="12455790">Mr Meyers what if the Commission had simply declined to suspend the rates, in affect done nothing, what would be your position then as to the requirement of environmental impact statement?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_h_meyers" startTime="3101.932" stopTime="3591.034">
            <label>Mr. Peter H. Meyers</label>
            <text syncTime="3101.932" offset="12511065">It's Scrap's position Your Honor that it does not matter what action the Commission takes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.486" offset="12533321">Whether it suspends or not suspends, the important factor in this case is that when the Commission is going to -- can make that decision when it is considering whether or not to allow increased rates on recyclable commodities to go into effect, it is required to know what affect those rate increases will have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.801" offset="12606568">Whether it takes either specific action is not crucial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.502" offset="12625377">The Section in language 102 which requires compliance with 102 to the fullest extent possible has been held by a number of courts which are quoted in our brief to impose a high standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.259" offset="12680443">It does not create as the Court in Calvert Cliffs pointed out and the “escape hatch for footdragging agencies.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.149" offset="12711999">The impact statement must be prepared as early as possible and in all cases prior to agency decision which may have a significant affect upon the environment, even interim agency decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.768" offset="12766438">The cases to this affect and the Council on Environmental Quality guidelines to this affect are quoted at pages 15 through 16 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.242" offset="12808338">The Solicitor as well as the railroads places great stress on the Commission's February one finding of no environmental impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.934" offset="12843133">I would like to address this point for a few minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.697" offset="12858180">It is our position that the court below correctly held that this unsupported finding which was severally criticized by both the Council on environmental quality and environmental protection agency was no more than glorified (Voice Overlap).</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.751" offset="12922337">It ignored Section 5 (B) of the CEQ guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.581" offset="12945742">The Section 5 (B) of the CEQ guidelines requires the agencies to prepare an impact statement whenever they are is “Potential” that the environment maybe significantly affected or if the impact is and “likely to be highly controversial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.441" offset="13021184">The government points out in its brief that the CEQ guidelines are entitled to great weight, we agree with that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.739" offset="13050337">In any event, the Interstate Commerce Commission has incorporated the CEQ guidelines into its own rules and would be bound by them in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.160" offset="13095999">Another reason why the February 1st finding cannot adequately support the Commission's decision in this case is that on February 1st, the Commission was considering whether or not to suspend temporary 2.5% surcharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.755" offset="13166425">We did not go into the court after the February 1st suspension decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.708" offset="13186173">We waited until the Commission had made a suspension decision on the 4.1% permanent selective increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.954" offset="13219192">We are unable to see how a finding with respect to a 2.5% temporary surcharge could be held to support the Commission's decision on April 24th when it was considering larger permanent increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.677" offset="13286066">Finally on March 6th the Commission issued a draft environmental impact statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.785" offset="13322533">The scope of this statement is somewhat unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.558" offset="13333608">At portions of the impact statement the Commission says that for purposes of considering the impact they will evaluate the permanent increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.679" offset="13366105">In other portions of the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.016" offset="13375404">The Commission says it is considering the surcharge as if it was a permanent part of the rate structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.554" offset="13401631">In this draft impact statement, which is set up also in the Appendix, the Commission frankly acknowledged that it did not know what affect even the surcharge would have, if made a permanent part of the rate structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.867" offset="13466833">If this is true, how could the Commission know what effect the larger permanent increases might have upon the environment and how can they continue to rely on this February 1st finding, in the very beginning of the proceeding where they made their boilerplate determination that there was no potential impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.829" offset="13554709">The crucial issue in this case, as the Railroads and the Solicitor have argued it, is whether it is impossible for the Commission to comply with NEPA and with the CEQ guidelines within the 30-day period it has for determining whether or not to suspend a rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.393" offset="13640913">I, before answering this, I would like to reinforce our position in this case that the District Court did not hold and we are not seeking an absolute rule that the Commission must always prepare its draft impact statement before its suspension decisions, but we point out to this Court that it maybe quite possible for the Commission to prepare impact statements in future general rate increase proceedings on recyclable commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.839" offset="13742686">Once it has finally prepared the draft environmental impact statement in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.210" offset="13768182">Secondly, we submit to this Court that this 30-day period is not an inflexible period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.304" offset="13804544">The Commission can and has extended this 30-day period to several months in order to give the public, greater notice of the purposed increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.089" offset="13847698">The government's reply brief at page 4 quotes a portion of Section 63 Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.998" offset="13895346">Reading that whole Section of the Interstate Commerce Act, it becomes apparent and it has been consistently construed by the Interstate Commerce Commission that whenever the railroads request special permission to depart from normal tariff filing requirements, the Commission can require the railroad to provide the public with whatever amount of times notice the Commission thinks is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.654" offset="14009971">Now the Solicitor's brief points out, it should -- it points -- makes the argument, pardon me, makes the argument that whether or not the Commission should file an impact statement should not depend upon the fortuitous circumstance of whether the railroads request special permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.325" offset="14080711">It is my understanding, however, that railroads tariffs with the last 30 years and into the foreseeable future are always so complicated that the railroads are as a practical matter always require to seek special permission in these general rate increase cases and that as a practical matter, the Commission will always have the opportunity to extend this 30-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.435" offset="14197112">More important, however, is the fact that the Commission should have begun its environmental assessment when NEPA went into affect three years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.217" offset="14236191">It should not have waited until the railroads came to them with their purposed increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.784" offset="14258552">It will always be in the Commission's language, impossible for the Commission to comply, if it does nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.429" offset="14289063">It will have its first 30-day suspension period, in its own language and then it will issue its final order and it will be impossible to comply in that proceeding and then the second time the Railroads come for their rate increases, it will impossible to comply at the suspension stage and by the final order and this key go on forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.903" offset="14374954">Also the Council on Environmental Quality specifically informed the Interstate Commerce Commission below that it should file an adequate draft impact statement prior to its first suspension decision on February 1st and inform them again prior to its second suspension decision on April 24th.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.533" offset="14465546">It is also --</text>

            <text syncTime="4044.628" offset="16281893">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4047.449" offset="16293177">I would like to begin my argument by discussing some of the questions which have been raised by the Court to other counsel and initially to reply to the question that Mr. Justice Brennan posed to Mr. Cox, regarding the relationship between NEPA and this Court's decision in Arrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="4073.300" offset="16396622">The Court's decision in this case applying NEPA is a very different decision, a very different set of facts than the decision involved in Arrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="4088.138" offset="16455973">Arrow involved judicial interference with rate making.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.505" offset="16477393">Arrow involved a court deciding what a reasonable rate would be, issuing an injunction on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4104.263" offset="16520443">This case has nothing to do with that kind of exercise of discretion which we acknowledge is committed to an agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.535" offset="16561507">This case deals with clear, unambiguous procedures that the National Environmental Policy Act imposes upon all federal agencies not including the courts who are not agencies under the APA and whom we submit are not agencies under NEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="4133.938" offset="16639143">The significance of the difference between the Arrow set of facts and the set of facts in this case is that in Arrow, it could be said that a court was interfering with the Congressional decision to commit discretion to the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="4154.764" offset="16722422">Here, what the court is doing is enforcing on what is perhaps the most recalcitrant agency among federal agencies with respect to NEPA the clear Congressional requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4172.404" offset="16792952">It is working to enforce Congressional requirements, it is not working against the discretion of an agency which Congress has committed to that agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.841" offset="16850735">What the Court did was see that the Commission from the beginning of the National Environmental Policy Act on January 1, 1970 had done nothing to attempt to accommodate its practices to the requirements of NEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.959" offset="16955225">The court was faced with a situation where as early as October 1970, the Council on Environmental Quality which in answer to your question Mr. Justice White is the agency which we could say would have the responsibility to interpret NEPA, had told the Commission, it's your job to begun to comply with NEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="4239.086" offset="17059715">It's particularly your job to apply its procedures in order to fulfill the explicit policy, that Congress set forth in NEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="4253.182" offset="17116139">The clearest policy, the clearest substantive policy that Congress set was to enhance the quality of renewable resources and approach the maximum attainable recycling of depletable resources.</text>

            <text syncTime="5046.429" offset="20289076">In this circumstance, we think that the conflict in the light of the Commission's behavior ought to be resolved in favor of affirming the district court's very effective action.</text>
