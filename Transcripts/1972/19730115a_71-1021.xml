            <label>Mr. A. L. Zwerdling</label>
            <text syncTime="57.951" offset="335182">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.588" offset="353677">We are here on certiorari from a five-four decision of Eighth Circuit granting motion to dismiss a complaint filed by employees of the State of Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.787" offset="398503">They sue for time-and-a-half overtime pay and additional equal amount as liquidated damages and reasonable counsel fees as provided for in a Fair Labor Standards Act known as the Wage-Hour Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.386" offset="456913">That Act was amended in 1966 to apply to such state employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.413" offset="485021">Complaint was filed on Federal District Court in 1969, alleging violation of the overtime provisions commencing in 1967 on February of that year and continuing thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.606" offset="541759">In 1966, amendments to the Act under which these employees of state schools and hospital sue was held to a proper exercise of the congressional power under Commerce Clause in Maryland versus Wirtz by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.067" offset="603617">And the case today presents the question which was expressly reserved in Maryland versus Wirtz as unnecessary to decision there of whether employees may sue in federal court to enforce rights given them by 1966 Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.783" offset="674461">We submit that Congress intended to permit such employee suits against the States for violation of the Act and that Congress have the power under the Commerce Clause to so provide not withstanding the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.048" offset="739558">The congressional intent is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.190" offset="752097">Statute in 16 (b) of that Act provides and I quote “Any employer -- any employer who violates the provisions of Section 6 or Section 7, those are the minimum wage and overtime pay provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.672" offset="814059">Any employer who so violates the provisions of this Act shall be a liable to the employees affected in the amount of their unpaid minimum wages or their unpaid overtime compensation as the case may be, and then in additional equal amount as liquidated damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.503" offset="885426">Actions to recover such liability may be maintained at any court of competent jurisdiction in Section (b), the language of States. Now the term “employer” which is used in that Section as defined in Section 3 of the Act and what those amendments in 1966 did was to expand this definition to bring under the statute as employers within the meaning of that Section, the States and their political subdivisions with the respect to certain institutions, schools, and hospitals. Prior to that year of the amendments, the Section said employer shall not include the United States or any state or political subdivision of a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.835" offset="1058670">But when they added the amendatory language, Congress specifically injected a removal of that exclusion of the states from the definition by inserting the language in 1966, “except with respect to employees of a state or political subdivision thereof, employed in a hospital, institution, or school referred to in a last sentence of Subsection (r) of this Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.676" offset="1182072">And so Congress chose explicitly to remove this previously excluded category and the subsection to which it reversed in this definition is the definition of the word “enterprise.”</text>
            <text syncTime="283.450" offset="1237138">Here, Congress added to the list of covered enterprises, the operation of a hospital, institution, or school, and once again on those amendments, Congress underlined its expressed intention by adding these words, “Regardless of whether or not such hospital, institution, or school is public or private or operated for profit or not for profit.”</text>
            <text syncTime="309.556" offset="1341628">Nothing could be clear or more explicit and again, in the next Subsection which speaks of the definition of “enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce.”</text>
            <text syncTime="323.424" offset="1397112">Congress added the same language once again stressing, “Regardless of whether or not such hospital, institution, or school is public or private.”</text>
            <text syncTime="335.425" offset="1445073">The remedy of the employee’s suit in Section 16 (b) has existed in the statute since it was enacted in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.272" offset="1476420">It reaches the States here because it says, “Any employer who violate this Sections will be subject to such suits.”</text>
            <text syncTime="350.739" offset="1506304">And by expanding that definition of employer thus this remedy comes into play.</text>

            <text syncTime="869.129" offset="3579904">And the State of Missouri was unnoticed when that decision was handed down in 1968, that commerce and the exercise of its plenary power under the Commerce Clause had determined that the problem of labor disputes, the problem of maintaining of eliminating unfair competition between the States and the effects on commerce was best dealt with by that enactment in its wisdom and it’s so acted and the Court so upheld the action of Congress in Maryland versus Wirtz.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.446" offset="3737161">As I say, that case involved not only the State of Maryland, but the State of Missouri, they were a party to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1003.714" offset="4118235">And again, in the Rayonier case, Rayonier Inc. versus United States, the court said, “we expressly decided in Indian Towing that an injured party cannot be deprived of its rights under the Act by resorting to an alleged distinction, imported from the law of municipal corporations between the Government’s negligence when it acts on a proprietary capacity and its negligence when it acts in uniquely governmental capacity.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1400.757" offset="5706376">The petitioners here are nonprofessional employees of state hospitals and of a state school in Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.729" offset="5738245">Their complaint which was dismissed does not specify their citizenship, but presumably, they are also citizens of Missouri and the suit therefore does not come within the literal terms of the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.973" offset="5807313">The protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act were extended to these employees in 1966 Amendments to the Act which this Court upheld as constitutional in Maryland against Wirtz.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.757" offset="5862379">And they are seeking here to sue their employers in Federal Court for unpaid overtime compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.362" offset="5892786">As Mr. Zwerdling ably pointed it out at the beginning of his argument on their face, the remedial provisions they invoked under the Act apply to these employees and their employers just as they do to any others covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.480" offset="5969272">And so the question presented is whether constitutional considerations nonetheless require that this category of employees be discriminated against by being denied a remedy against their employers provided by Congress and available to all others within the Act’s coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.577" offset="6069687">The answer in our view is to be found by putting together this Court’s decision in Maryland against Wirtz, with its prior decision and Parden against Terminal Railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.529" offset="6137501">What Parden holds is that where a state engages in activities that are validly subject to congressional regulation under the Commerce Clause, it is subject to that regulation as fully as if it were private person or a corporation, and specifically that Congress can in effect condition the states continued participation in the regulated activity on constructive consent to be sued under the federal regulatory statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.166" offset="6276054">And Maryland against Wirtz of course adds to this that the activities involves here are activities that are validly subject to congressional regulation under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.171" offset="6324015">It seems to us that these cases have developed that as the relevant test rather than the old distinctions that were attempted to be drawn between governmental and proprietary functions or what might be called essential functions or traditional functions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1642.503" offset="6673429">Now, indeed, we think that in two important respects, this case really follows a fortiori from Parden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.458" offset="6729226">First, the FELA which was the statute at issue in Parden made no reference to state-owned railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.125" offset="6767888">It merely said that “Every common carrier by railroad while engaging in commerce” is liable to injured employees and subject to suit and the court there had to decide whether this general language should be construed to include state-owned the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.106" offset="6843747">A majority held that it should although four dissenting justices were of the view that Congress should speak more specifically in order to subject States to suit if they engage in activity subject to regulation under the Commerce Clause and here Congress has explicitly amended a series of definitional provisions in the Fair Labor Standards Act to make the Act’s provision apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="1737.389" offset="7052936">So it was both the constitutional under statutory decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.245" offset="7064325">The court was unanimous on its constitutional holding but divided five to four on a statutory construction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1896.973" offset="7691264">So that in effect the judgment against the employer in that case is nothing but he should have paid all along and sometime earlier and he’s had the use of the money in the 31:48.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.050" offset="7747584">Now, there is another important respect in which this case in our view follows a fortiori from Parden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.541" offset="7793560">Here the substantive requirements of the Act clearly apply to the state of employers and the only question is whether in the context of state employment, this substantive right should be separated from the statutory remedy provided for employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.299" offset="7884570">In our view, even if this kind of divorce of rights from remedies might be possible in interpreting some statutes, it is particularly inappropriate with respect to the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.887" offset="7946951">Because under the Fair Labors Standards Act, the remedy is not merely compensatory as it is in most statutes including the FELA which was involved in Parden but the remedy itself also accomplishes an important part of the regulatory objective that Congress had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.080" offset="8027721">Since one of the principle purposes of the act is to insure that some employers do not gain an unfair advantage over their competitors by paying substandard wages, that is why this Court has said that Section 16 (b) of the Act involved here has both a public and a private character that it is both compensatory and an enforcement provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.233" offset="8136286">And significantly, the Senate Report on the 1966 Amendments specifically said that one of the purposes of extending the Act to cover this state-run institutions was to bring about a competitively equality with similar activities carried on by business enterprises.</text>

            <text syncTime="2066.956" offset="8371179">I think there is a rational basis for concluding that in many instances they are competing with privately run instances they are competing with privately-run enterprises and Congress spell was unfair for the privately-run enterprise to have to comply with the provisions in the Fair Labor Standard Act and to have competing services made available by state institutions at lower clause to uses of those services partly because low paid non-professional personnel are being paid substandard wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.873" offset="8498866">This was one of the conclusions Congress came to and enacting the amendments that this Court upheld in Maryland against Wirtz.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.881" offset="8538885">Another basic purpose of the Fair Labor Standards Act resided in the Act itself was to avoid labor disputes that interfere with the commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.955" offset="8583189">Congress wanted to take these controversies about substandard wages and overtime compensation out of the streets and into the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.888" offset="8622895">Yet what could be more calculated to lead to labors strife than a holding that employees whose federal statutory rights have been violated are to be denied a judicial remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.354" offset="8672737">So in this respect too, the remedy here is an integral part of the regulatory objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.986" offset="8699277">But it is not merely compensatory and not merely designed to encourage compliance with the Act as our most remedies in statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.263" offset="8752462">Of course, it also does encourage compliance and thereby furthers the Act’s other objectives such as reducing unemployment by encouraging employers to hire more people rather than to work their employees at overtime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.254" offset="8816410">This is one of the basic objectives of the act and except continuing importance with our persistent unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.366" offset="8856848">Now, the fact that the Secretary of Labor is also empowered to bring enforcement suits here which will not fully compensate the employees does not in our view call for a different result than in Parden because of the vast numbers of employees and establishments covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.631" offset="8937932">The Secretary is unable to bring suits except in the small proportion of the cases in which violations occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.727" offset="8974294">Indeed, the Secretary is not staffed even to be able to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.279" offset="9000521">All possible violations let alone to bring suit against all the violations that occur and of necessity the Secretary’s limited staff of 15 attorneys and 13 regional offices must concentrate their efforts on cases that involved the greatest public interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2433.631" offset="9837902">That is Maryland versus Wirtz in the 1966 Amendment to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.777" offset="9858487">Furthermore, there’s no doubt that Missouri has an obligation to obey the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.924" offset="9887117">And looking at the Parden case, we do not dispute the fact that Congress has power to require Missouri to waive its constitutional immunity from suit as a condition to entering into activities where Congress has regulated it -- regulated the activities pursuant towards commerce power, if Congress so provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.213" offset="9976247">And finally, there is no question presented by this case as to whether a state court would be required to hear an action brought under 216 (b) or 16 (b) by a private employee whether that would be required either by Federal Constitutional law or by Missouri law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2708.812" offset="10938598">Now, there is a remedy under Section 17 as to the third remedy where the Secretary of Labor may seek an injunction against the employer and as part of this equitable relief, request restitution of unpaid wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.705" offset="10990216">It would seem that Section 17 has pretty much eliminated Section 16 (b) as an effective remedy by the Secretary of Labor, because he can do more under that Section with fewer restraints than it can under Section 16 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.281" offset="11052492">16 (b) has a provision that he may not bring an action when there is a novel legal question undecided by the courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2800.781" offset="11306506">And the question is, “Did the exclusion of State employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act automatically result in an intention that Congress would make applicable the 16 (b) remedies of private suit against the State to such employers?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.954" offset="11379231">Really the question is, “Did Congress destroy the State’s constitutional immunity from suit in this area?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.546" offset="11413608">We note that there is not one word in the Fair Labor Standards Act itself where the 1966 amendments indicates that a state is subject to suit by private individuals notwithstanding its constitutional immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.454" offset="11481213">It has often been observed that the federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.846" offset="11506709">Now, the Fair Labor Standards Act does not, in itself, confer jurisdiction to hear a case arising from the Act in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.370" offset="11548818">The jurisdiction is conferred by 28 U.S.C. Section 1339, which is a jurisdiction statute and an act -- deals with an act of Congress regulating commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="2884.537" offset="11641501">Now, it has been held by this Court that the mere fact that there is a federal question in the case does not mean that the states are subject to suit by private individuals in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.112" offset="11695835">And we would submit that since the basic federal question jurisdictional statute is little different except for jurisdiction amount and the jurisdiction statute that is involved in cases of Congress or cases arising out of acts of Congress regulating Congress that it can be argued and should be argued that Congress has not intended one, in one way to any degree to change the State’s basic position which is that they are immune from suit in the federal courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3260.670" offset="13146049">As a matter fact, the Department of Labor has sued Missouri and has sued, to my knowledge, at least ten other states to recover unpaid overtime compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3306.962" offset="13331205">Parden recognizes that a State must consent to suit and the Court in that case went on to find that Alabama when it commenced operation of a railroad 20 years after the FELA was enacted necessarily consented to such suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3335.060" offset="13443636">That it consents after Maryland versus Wirtz were decided or was it some other date at which it was consented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.154" offset="13471953">It is known and is recognized by the court below that Missouri operated schools and hospitals prior to the effective date of the 1966 Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.250" offset="13520332">At some point according to the arguments advanced by the petitioners Missouri must have consented to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.269" offset="13552410">But I do not see how you can say that the State continuing the activities that it has historically engaged in, in which it had been recognized as functions of state government consented to waive its constitutional immunity from suit in a federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.801" offset="13630568">Certainly, the Act did not advise Missouri in express language that it was going to have to make what the District Court in Idaho was temred to Hobson’s choice of either foregoing the operation of its schools and hospitals or consenting to suit by private individuals in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.019" offset="13707473">Congress very easily could have provided an expressed waiver provision where it would advise the States that they would lose this immunity but it has not done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.804" offset="13750627">And that leads me to three factors which the court below distinguished this case from Parden, and I think each of these factors are very important in considering that question of what did Congress intend when it made the State subject to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.460" offset="13829204">First of all, there is the very nature of schools and hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.097" offset="13843728">There are traditionally activities States engage in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.856" offset="13866820">Considering the nature of those activities, is it reasonable to infer that Congress would intend that an employee would recover double before the State were to spend funds on the care of the patients or the students of the institutions covered?</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.588" offset="13949680">And of course, there’s the fact that there are double damages and attorney’s fees that are available to the private employees that they are permitted to maintain the suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="4192.421" offset="16873096">The compliant was filed by these employees in August of 1969 for backpay and liquidated damages commencing in February of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="4201.981" offset="16911339">The Secretary of Labor came in later in January of 1971, reaching back only to January of 1969 and then only because of the course of this litigation and its disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4215.659" offset="16965987">Let me just conclude by reemphasizing once again that as was said in Parden, “By empowering Congress to regulate commerce then, the states necessarily surrender any portion of their sovereignty that would stand in the way of such regulation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4235.592" offset="17045713">Such regulation involves two parts, two sides of the coin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4240.225" offset="17064312">It involves reaching the substantives matter by exercise of the commerce power to achieve this coverage that we’re talking about, but at the same time, there goes with that exercising commerce power to reach the remedy which is the chosen means, which has been utilized successfully since 1938 which Congress in the light of that long experienced with millions of situations around the country with some 40 million people decided to extend to certain limited classes of state employees as they did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4276.274" offset="17208508">We believe that Maryland versus Wirtz and Parden govern and as was said in Maryland versus Wirtz, I conclude on this if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="4285.828" offset="17246647">It said “This Court was, of course, concerned only with the finding of a substantially effect on interstate competition and not where the consequent policy decisions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4296.943" offset="17291160">Quoting another case, Katz and Buck, this Court said, “Where we find that the legislatures have a rational basis for finding a chosen regulatory scheme necessary to the protection of commerce, our investigation isn’t at an end.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4313.729" offset="17358242">May I submit that in Parden when that case was concluded the Court had already determined as to this situation that that case -- that this investigation is at an end.</text>

            <text syncTime="4340.584" offset="17465657">Mr. Chief Justice, that argument is better than mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.628" offset="17481853">It is all of the aspects of the federal jurisdiction, the availability of liberal discovery which is very important to employees in these suits, the uniformity that you point out, the fact that there is more expertise in interpreting federal laws, all of the panoply of reasons, which would cause Congress to be moved to make this remedy available in any court of competent jurisdiction.</text>
