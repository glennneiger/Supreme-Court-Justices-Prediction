            <text syncTime="6.265" offset="128397">This case is here on appeal from the state courts of Arizona where appellant filed suit to recover state income tax withheld from her income.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.425" offset="177089">She claims that the state has no jurisdiction to collect its state income tax from her on a ground that she is a Navajo Indian who at all relevant times live and worked within the boundaries of Navajo Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.457" offset="237171">The State Courts of Arizona denied her claim despite an unbroken line of decisions by this Court that States have no jurisdiction over the reservation affairs of Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.947" offset="283146">This Court first interpreted the constitutional relationship between the States and Indian tribes in 1982 in the case of Worcester against Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.159" offset="324002">Mr. Chief Justice Marshall’s opinion reviews in detail the constitutional provisions that relate to Indians and concludes that plain area authority over Indian is conferred by the Constitution on the Federal Government and at state laws can have no force or effect on Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.688" offset="398085">Subsequent decisions of this Court modified that decision in one area where the referrals of non-Indians only are involved on an Indian reservation and where the Indians were not directly involved at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.728" offset="454301">In addition, Congress has exercised its plain area authority on certain occasions to grant to the States authority over reservation Indians.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert B. Collins</label>
            <text syncTime="185.221" offset="844257">The decisions of this Court where summed up in the only treaties on Indian law ever produced by Mr. Felix Cohen in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.537" offset="881560">He stated, “State laws generally are not applicable to tribal Indians on an Indian reservation except for Congress as expressly provided that state law shall apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.342" offset="920743">It follows the Indians and Indian property on an Indian reservation, are not subject to state taxation, except by virtue of an expressed authority conferred upon the State by act of Congress.”</text>
            <text syncTime="215.475" offset="965256">It is our contention that rule applies here that Arizona has acted in contravention of that rule and that this Court should reverse on that account.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.623" offset="1001827">Now that rule doesn’t apply to all Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.646" offset="1009977">There are Indians who were never placed under federal protection, never got a reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.094" offset="1027741">There are other Indians over whom the federal protection has been ended by Congress beginning with Oklahoma in the late 19th century.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.664" offset="1062013">But, the Navajos are still fully under federal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.254" offset="1076433">In 1868, United States entered into a treaty with the Navajos under which the Navajos agreed to peace under the protection of United States and the reservation was set aside for their exclusive use.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.444" offset="1125125">The treaty specifically provides that outsiders cannot enter the reservation without permission of the Navajos with the exception of federal agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.138" offset="1163891">In 1912, 44 years later Arizona was admitted to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.834" offset="1182699">However, the United States honored is treaty commitment to the Navajos by conditioning that admission in the Arizona Enabling Act on the expressed ground that Arizona agreed the reservations Indian affairs remain under the exclusive control of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.115" offset="1247796">In 1949, Congress passed a Bill which would have ceded concurrent authority over reservation Indians in Arizona to -- over the Navajos to the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.448" offset="1293145">But President Truman vetoed the Bill expressly because he objected to that provision, and today the Navajos have a comprehensive tribe government which rules territory in three different States.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.507" offset="1341419">It has a full court system that adjudicates all civil matters arising between Indians on the reservation and all misdemeanors as to Indians on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.851" offset="1386768">It has an appellate court the rules as to questions of law as does this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.254" offset="1404426">It has a bar with Navajo advocates who practice before the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.932" offset="1427101">It has its own police system.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.430" offset="1437132">It has many regularity functions that deal with the things that the -- are important to the Navajo people such as stock raising, business licensing, and alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.826" offset="1478719">A long list of regularity services are provided by state government -- by the tribal government that are comfortable to those provided by state and local government elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.026" offset="1511528">We detail this in our reply brief and it does tax its people.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.162" offset="1532008">There is a gross receipts tax on sales on the reservation in effect to sale tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.591" offset="1557713">The governmental functions on the reservation that are not tribal are by enlarged federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.191" offset="1580178">All healthcares delivered by the Federal Government to the United States Public Health Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.582" offset="1597733">Roads are built by Federal Government and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.468" offset="1609226">The Navajos are poor the federal services are important to them at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.212" offset="1628244">Now, we have argued three grounds independent legal grounds for reversal of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.245" offset="1656351">I intend to address myself essentially to one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.990" offset="1671293">The one set out really in Mr. Cohen’s role that I recited earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.973" offset="1699297">That this --that dispute focuses on the 1959 decision of this Court in Williams against Lee.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.235" offset="1728345">That case also involved the Navajo Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.811" offset="1738585">In that case, a non-Indian brought suit against a Navajo couple in the state courts of Arizona based on a reservation incurred debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.208" offset="1776201">The Navajos moved to dismiss in the ground that the tribal government alone had jurisdiction over the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.339" offset="1800756">The Arizona Supreme Court denied that claim ruling that because no act of Congress expressly forbad the state court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.715" offset="1834193">The state court must have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.512" offset="1845373">That’s the very claim Arizona makes here.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.447" offset="1853210">We are just having a renewal of the same dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.511" offset="1869406">In that case, this Court reversed, unanimously reversed the Arizona Supreme Court in an opinion which forcefully renewed the federal protection over reservation Indian governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.011" offset="1915382">This Court referred to the treaty between the Navajo people and the federal government in these terms, “Implicit in this treaty terms was the understanding that the internal affairs of the Indians remain exclusively within the jurisdiction of whatever tribal government existed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="473.799" offset="1998555">Now, the court went on to acknowledge that decisions of this Court had applied state laws in Indian reservations to the affairs of non-Indians and recited the cases were that have been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.297" offset="2044531">And to that extent that the old case of Worcester against Georgia had been modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.929" offset="2063130">However, in the very same sentence, the Court said, “The basic policy of Worcester has remained.”</text>
            <text syncTime="496.753" offset="2090402">In other words, the policy that the affairs of the Indians themselves on the reservation are under exclusively federal and tribal authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.212" offset="2128227">This Court also emphasized the meticulous control which Congress has exercised over the years of the reservation Indian affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.715" offset="2166262">The Court stated that Congress had acted consistently upon the assumption that the States have no power to regulate Indian affairs on reservations and that when Congress has wished the States to exercise the power, it is granted them the jurisdiction which Worcester against Georgia denied the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.261" offset="2240449">Now, in the phase of this unbroken string of decisions, the Arizona court below essentially tried to avoid the affect of the decision on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.700" offset="2298128">First, the court below dealt with this Court’s decision in Williams against Lee by distinguishing -- creating a distinction I would say between the affairs of the Navajo tribe and the affairs of individual Navajo Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.301" offset="2360613">The court seems to say that if the state invasion does not cripple the tribal government, that is okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.232" offset="2396348">However, this Court has, in many occasions ruled that affairs of individual Indians on reservations are subject to the jurisdiction of the tribe and not the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.266" offset="2436472">In the Kansas Indians a 19th century case, this Court expressly ruled that the State of Kansas could not tax individual Indians -- in the state -- in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.256" offset="2472417">The affairs of the tribe were not involved at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="603.361" offset="2516825">In a much more recent case, I think they were both personal and real property in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.483" offset="2557262">In a much more recent case, in Kennerly against District Court of Montana, the Montana District Court, excuse me, the Montana Supreme Court made the same sort of ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.777" offset="2598431">It said that a personal debt of an individual Indian is not a tribal affair.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.937" offset="2619120">This Court overruled that decision in this Court’s opinion in Kennerly against District Court of Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.559" offset="2641586">And of course, Williams against Lee itself really involved the personal affairs on an Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.302" offset="2656632">The tribe wasn’t a party to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.532" offset="2665514">All the tribe did was provided a court where the Navajo contended the manner should have been heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.856" offset="2694771">Now, the -- the language in this Court’s opinion in Williams against Lee that Arizona relies on is what the briefs refer to as the infringement test.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.761" offset="2738448">In reads the question has always been whether the state action infringed on the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.890" offset="2774915">We suggest that Arizona has badly distorted the meaning of that phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.797" offset="2794559">Of course, the phrase begins with the question has always been.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.597" offset="2805739">It is not a new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.735" offset="2810337">In other words, the Court was referring to the time honored rule that reservation Indians are entitled to govern their own affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.929" offset="2839071">Furthermore, the court state makes their own laws and be ruled by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.722" offset="2854222">We suggest what that means is, the laws that Indians make rule rather than state laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="1227.305" offset="5012564">At the time we adjourned, I was pointing out that the implications of Arizona’s position create great uncertainty for reservation Indians.</text>

            <text syncTime="1749.088" offset="7099747">The United States agrees with Mr. Collins’ position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.875" offset="7122840">I want to try to clarify the position as we see it and then to emphasize the amount of the congressional activity that has been in this area of the law and the impropriety of allowing a state unilaterally to obtain jurisdiction within an Indian reservation where Congress has not authorize the state to obtain that jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.753" offset="7246346">In our view, it’s been the law for many years that in the absence of a congressional authorization that -- some situations are consent of the tribe itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.067" offset="7299636">State laws including state tax laws, not limited to state tax laws including state tax laws have no applicability to Indians within an Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.171" offset="7356061">This has been the literally hornbook law as we point out in our brief with the quotation to Mr. Felix Cohen’s hornbook.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.866" offset="7398797">It also is the -- in our view the real holding of Williams versus Lee, what’s happened is that the court in the Kake case which had nothing to do with tribal -- with reservation Indians had to make a one sentence paraphrase of Williams versus Lee.</text>

            <text syncTime="2236.861" offset="9050781">If Worcester versus Georgia stood in its original strength then Kahn couldn’t be taxed either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.161" offset="9092054">And if a reservation were an absolute federal enclave in which the state can have no authority against anyone including non-Indians, he couldn’t be taxed either.</text>

            <text syncTime="2286.710" offset="9250252">For instance, in 1929, I believe it was, the Congress decided it would be a good idea to allow the state motor vehicle fuel taxes to apply to sales of motor vehicle fuel whether it was on any sort of federal reservation or not and whether it was sold even by a licensed trader or not, and specifically authorized that tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.316" offset="9352652">And from that date on without decisions of the court or any kind of serious problem, the states had been able to collect the motor vehicle tax on with congressional authority within Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.585" offset="9413674">In 1949, when Congress, at the time when military bases were being built around the country, 1940 actually, I believe it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.903" offset="9454947">When congress considered whether it wanted to allow state income taxes and state sales taxes to apply within federal areas where the debate on this Act which is called the Buck Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.291" offset="9516492">Debate on this Act was very clear that some congressmen proposed that it should apply within Indian reservations too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.472" offset="9545226">The Department of the Interior objected to that and wanted to have Indian reservations totally excluded from the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.604" offset="9569782">And the conclusion that Congress arrived at was to put in 4 U.S.C. 109 which says though the States may assess income tax within federal areas, these shall not apply to Indians not otherwise taxed which is the standard phrase for Indians living in the reservation or on Indian country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.053" offset="9659538">Now, we do not say – we’re not trying to undo the footnote on the Warren Trading Post case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.263" offset="9684407">It said the Buck Act did not apply to Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.592" offset="9697782">But if it doesn’t apply to Indian reservations it was a conscious choice by Congress that not to authorize the imposition of state income taxes to Indians within Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.887" offset="9762879">Similarly, Congress has authorized the taxation of mineral interests within Indian reservations but in doing so, it did it with particularity and only authorized the taxation of mineral interests on unallotted, tribally-held lands and then provided that the state taxes could not create a lien on the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.161" offset="9871966">And away from the area of taxation, I don’t think I need to discuss Public Law 280 here that of course, it is the basic statute in which Congress authorized states to exercise a broad jurisdiction that also with broad limits within Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.023" offset="9939466">But I want to point out this one particular statute, very limited statute that was cited in the Kake case, that’s 25 U.S.C. 231.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.196" offset="9984188">Congress in the 1930s decided that it would be a good idea to let state health authorities enter Indian reservations and to allow state truancy officers to enter Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.818" offset="10042598">Obviously considered, they took a congressional act to do this but when Congress acted, it did it in a particular way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.656" offset="10069974">It authorized the Secretary of the Interior to allow these federal officers to enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.992" offset="10095365">It didn’t direct them to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.373" offset="10100903">It authorized them at his discretion to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.763" offset="10114382">It directed him, if he does this to write his own rules and regulations to determine the extent to which the state officers could come in and further as the truancy part of it is it specifically provided that this could only be done with the consent of the tribal government if there is a tribal government over the area in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.236" offset="10200273">Now, we submit that this is the way that States should obtain jurisdiction within Indian reservations if they are to obtain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.956" offset="10235173">It should be by congressional act and though it’s not up to me to say so particularly, I think the congressional act should also require the consent of the Indian tribe because when the reservations were created whether by treaty or Executive Order, it will certainly -- the assumption that the States would have no jurisdiction within those reservations under Worcester versus Georgia which was the ruling law then.</text>

            <text syncTime="2669.762" offset="10782386">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.556" offset="10801612">The issue on this case is whether or not the State of Arizona can impose its income tax on income of a Navajo Indian earned on the Navajo Indian reservation that particular Indian residing on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.730" offset="10866291">Now, there are a number of cases involving the question of federal income tax liability of Indians residing on reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.431" offset="10917073">And those cases have been decided in favor of their tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.968" offset="10943195">In the Oklahoma Tax Commission case, although that was an inheritance tax case, nevertheless the Government having the decision referred to the income tax cases and state and federal income tax liability were there equated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.190" offset="11016129">After -- there is the Leahy decision involving the Oklahoma income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.705" offset="11042147">This case was decided in the 1930s.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.085" offset="11055731">And in many ways, it is similar to the situation that we have today although the opinion is short.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.949" offset="11087182">The briefs throw conservatively more light on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.999" offset="11107349">The all state Indians had a reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.105" offset="11119783">They had a treaty with the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.185" offset="11132113">They had a tribal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.177" offset="11140054">As a matter of fact, the United States Congress had passed the law providing for state probate jurisdiction in regard to the Osage before this case was decided, which is an indication that they had a viable tribal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.808" offset="11230647">Now in that particular case, the court upheld the state taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.302" offset="11268577">It appeared to the court from the opinion that since the Indians received the income and were free to dispose of it as they wished that there was no reason why they shouldn’t be taxed on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2817.130" offset="11371917">In the Leahy case, the income came from restricted mineral property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.325" offset="11400652">This was property that was owned by the tribe, the Osage tribe.</text>

            <text syncTime="2834.509" offset="11441403">That is something that I am not clear about because I wasn’t able to find anything in the record that indicated whether it was on or off the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.782" offset="11486542">There are some state court cases now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.478" offset="11505246">Four of them that have raised this, rather five of them, six I am counting this case in which the question is raised and all but one of them, the Brun case from Minnesota were decided in favor of tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.122" offset="11591868">The Gahate case from New Mexico is the one that is probably most like ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.956" offset="11615169">It involved a Navajo Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.555" offset="11621543">The only difference between the Gahate case and ours is that I can see is that in the Gahate case, counsel for the Navajo stipulated that imposition of the income tax by the State of New Mexico did not infringe upon the sovereignty of the Navajo tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.081" offset="11695731">The counsel was unwilling to stipulate that in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.359" offset="11712763">Now, in the Brun case, the court did apply the Williams versus Lee test absentee -- the test of validity of state action on Indian reservation is whether or not it infringes on any rights granted under any Act of Congress or upon the Indian right of self-government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.155" offset="11831986">The court in the Brun case concluded that the imposition of the Minnesota tax infringed on the right of self-government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.679" offset="11878066">There are some -- they simply assumed that it did apparently because of the economic impact of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.234" offset="11912338">In other words, if the Indians had to pay this tax to the State of Minnesota then there would be less able to pay a tax I supposed if the tribe should levy a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.853" offset="11970748">At any rate, this decision certainly in this respect is in conflict with decisions in cases like Graves versus New York and Helvering versus Gerhardt which involved the questions of whether or not state employees had to pay federal income taxes and whether or not federal employees had to pay state income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.367" offset="12064789">In those cases, while the court concluded that the fact that an employee of a state government or a federal government had to pay income taxes to the other government did not impose any sort of substantial burden on that other government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.927" offset="12131035">So, we have a test -- a practical test of substantial interference with the essential governmental function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.127" offset="12167920">The court in the Brun case obviously did not apply that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.567" offset="12185684">Now, one other factors involved in this connection, this tax has been imposed by the State of Arizona since 1957 at least when Attorney General opinion on the State of Arizona was rendered on that subject and if this tax really infringed upon the self-government of the Navajo tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.171" offset="12276067">It would seem that we should have heard about it before now.</text>

            <text syncTime="3172.526" offset="12793501">The income tax but that’s all reservations on the state and the Navajo Reservation, of course has most of the Indian population in the state because although the state may have a 125,000 Indians, 80,000 or 90,000 live on the Navajo Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.378" offset="12876884">Now, it’s our position that Williams Versus Lee which was cited by counsel for the appellee is distinguished both from this case because it did involved infringement up on the right of self-government of the Navajo tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.696" offset="12962147">That case involved the jurisdiction of the courts and there the court concluded that the state courts did not have a jurisdiction over what were essentially trouble matters, matter relating to the liability of a Navajo resident of the reservation in connection with a transaction entered into on the reservation and that for the same reasons and for the additional reasons that a procedural point was involved, we think that the Kennerly case is also distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.575" offset="13133720">Now, various arguments have been raised by the appellants that there was expressed congressional authorization was required in order for the state laws to apply on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.431" offset="13213132">This is an extremely narrow question as I think that the United States has already conceded in regards to the Khan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.099" offset="13251793">State laws may have on Indian reservations to third persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.244" offset="13272377">Now, I think that state laws as a practical matter do apply on Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.829" offset="13310725">When you’re talking about certain benefits or even benefits that are not conferred by federal statutes or by contract under the Johnson-O’Malley Act and I am talking about such things as the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.259" offset="13368404">When a Navajo Indian votes on a Navajo Reservation in a state election, he does not vote under tribal law or a federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.061" offset="13399646">He is voting under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.401" offset="13413021">Now, the case of Kake versus Egan set down what we considered the rule to be that state laws do apply on Indian reservations with two exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.332" offset="13480730">If they do not infringe upon the tribal government of the tribe or if they do not infringe upon any rights which were granted by an act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.060" offset="13535587">This is certainly in line with what this Court has held before in Surplus Trading Company versus Cook.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.494" offset="13569337">I believe, it was indicated to the effect that state laws have restricted application on Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.993" offset="13599326">Meaning that they do have application and I think by restricted application what the court was referring to were the exceptions such as the Indian right of self-government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.889" offset="13634957">And these laws cannot apply if they are in conflict with federal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.488" offset="13657318">And then in New York versus Martin where the court said that in the absence of treaty obligations are federal statute’s state laws do apply Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.679" offset="13726072">Now, it is our position that no Act of congress prohibits application of state income taxes to Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.646" offset="13773928">The first statute that comes to mind in this connection in chronological order is the State Enabling Act of the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.590" offset="13825755">And because there has been considerable confusion about the language, I would just like to read the language that has been the subject of dispute in this connection, “That the people inhabiting the said proposed state do agree and declare that they forever disclaim all right entitled to the unappropriated and ungranted public lands lying within the boundaries thereof and all lands lying within said boundaries owned or held by any Indian or Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.391" offset="13948949">The right or title to which it shall have been acquired through or from the United States or any prior sovereignty and that until the title of such Indian or Indian tribes shall have been extinguished the same shall be and remain subject to the disposition and under the absolute jurisdiction and control of the Congress of the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.336" offset="14040691">These are what we referred to as disclaimer in the absolute jurisdiction and control provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.959" offset="14071202">Now, they do not refer to Indian reservations although subsequently in the Enabling Act the Congress did refer to Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.342" offset="14108714">But they refer to Indian lands and the reason for that distinction as was pointed out in the Draper case was because in the General Allotment Act of 1887, Congress provided that Indians living off of reservations could obtain some unappropriated public lands that would be subject to the same restrictions as lands that were obtained under allotments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.746" offset="14226369">It was a desire of Congress at the time that Arizona was admitted to the union to protect the rights of the Indians in these lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.617" offset="14257821">And this Enabling Act is like that of many other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.774" offset="14274435">And this was done, this language was used, Indian lands were referred to for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.314" offset="14300662">There was no ambiguity at all in doing it and I think that this is confirmed by a number of state court decisions on the subject, as well as the more recent decision of this Court in Kake versus Egan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.302" offset="14372551">Now, there has -- Public Law 280 was enacted in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.755" offset="14406405">At that time, the policy of the Federal Government was to get out of the Indian reservations or it was the Termination Policy and this was one of -- and because this was the concern at that time, the provisions of 280 provided for state assumption of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.778" offset="14506506">Now, there was also some confusion at that time about what the State Enabling Acts meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.446" offset="14541197">This confusion has indicated in a letter that we have quoted from that was in the committee reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.747" offset="14566379">It’s in our brief and so Congress acted partly to clear up this confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.044" offset="14607548">They wanted to provide a procedure so that the States would not consider these Enabling Acts to be a stumbling block.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.318" offset="14640671">So that they would assume for measure of jurisdiction so that the Federal Government could be relieved of all responsibility for as soon as the Indians were ready for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.411" offset="14712978">Public Law 280 did not deprive the States of any jurisdiction that they already have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.249" offset="14736384">Now, the Civil Rights Act of 1968 amended Public Law 280 in effect to require tribal consent to the state assumption of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.054" offset="14787584">There is one more item and that is the Treaty of 1868.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.918" offset="14807019">And that treaty has nothing at all in and about the tax liability of the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.607" offset="14845785">It was in 1871 that the Government decided that the Indians were an internal problem that there would be no more treaties with the Indians and it would not seem fair to distinguish between the Navajos and the other Indians because the Navajos have a treaty that says nothing about taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.967" offset="14943274">Immunity from taxation is not to be implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.634" offset="14961873">If Congress has intended to accept a 100,000 Navajos in Arizona from income taxes, they would certainly have said so in clear and unmistakable language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.594" offset="15025716">Now, the Navajos are unusual in Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.898" offset="15046928">There are about 16 or 18 Indian reservations in the State of Arizona and the Navajos are not represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.402" offset="15072946">They are an extremely large reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.042" offset="15083499">They have more resources than the average reservation does and so they certainly require a less assistance than the other reservations do because some of the reservations are so small that they are hardly an economical unit, some an economical governmental unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.538" offset="15165524">Some of them may only have a few hundred acres and few hundred Indians on them and they can’t provide, they can’t receive the services from the Federal Government that the state would provide for them and they are obviously not able to furnish those services themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.422" offset="15249011">But even the Navajo Indians require many services from the state and it’s -- I don’t regard as important but counsel for the other side mentioned it and I am reluctant to mention it because it’s outside the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.346" offset="15312750">But nevertheless, according to the information from our Governor’s Report the financial picture that he presented of the relationship of the Indian and the tribe is not at all accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.466" offset="15369279">The state does have a very substantial state in the sense that the state spends a lot more money on the Indian reservations and it gets back out of them and the total runs into millions of dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.556" offset="15445556">Now, the income tax on net income is a very fair tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3844.341" offset="15480769">The rate structure of the Arizona state income tax is a low one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3850.406" offset="15505011">It runs from 1.5% to 8%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3854.757" offset="15522356">It is an extremely fair way to balance the burdens of state government.</text>
