            <label>Mr. Charles Alan Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="138.438" offset="659163">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.739" offset="680375">I would like to take those texts from my argument this morning, a sentence from an article that Professor Coons and his collaborators, Professors Sugarman and Clune, wrote last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.456" offset="731261">It’s quoted-- cited on page 44 of my initial brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.837" offset="752786">They said “of all public functions, education in its goals and methods, is least understood and most in need of local variety, experimentation, and independence.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.401" offset="815062">That, I think, is wise counsel.I believe that is the argument for reversal in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.849" offset="860829">In our view, the Texas system of school finance, imperfect as it is, we conceded its imperfections in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.399" offset="894997">The Texas system does allow through local variety, and experimentation, and independence.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.293" offset="918612">Not as much as I would like it too, but that is its goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.885" offset="937002">That is its rationale and, for that reason, there is a rational basis to it and I will undertake it of course in a moment, our view that the rational basis test is the appropriate test.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.793" offset="992590">The view adopted by the District Court that there is a rigid constitutional mandate for the quality of education may not be a function of wealth except the wealth of the state as a whole, and my submission is based on educational assumptions about matters that are, today, not understood and which educators are not ready to form firm judgments and it would seriously inhibit, if it would not destroy, all together the possibilities for local variety experimentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.022" offset="1161550">Dependence of which, as Professors Coons and Elle quite properly speaks of warmly.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.261" offset="1190494">Proposition one, the proposition adopted by the District Court in this case, would impose a constitutional straightjacket on the public schools of 50 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.087" offset="1245769">It would mean that, hereafter and permanently, or at least until a new book is written and the constitution changes again, that all measurements in terms of school-- of education of public schools must be in terms of per capita or per pupil, student expenditures even though there may be many other things that we ought to be worrying about in an effort to cure the problems of public education.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.477" offset="1371366">It would not necessarily destroy all local control.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.257" offset="1390488">There is the variation presented by Professor Coons and his associates described as district power equalizer.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.378" offset="1430925">If district power equalizing is consistent with the mandate of the Court below and the Court did not undertake to speak to that question at all, it left it completely open, then it would still be possible for an individual school district to decide “we want to spend more money here than that other school district to spend it,” and there would be an elaborate system so that this could be done and its inability to do so would simply depend on the tax rate the district was willing to impose on itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.464" offset="1543252">It would not depend on the taxable property in the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.562" offset="1559656">That would leave local control still in the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.587" offset="1575748">To that extent, it is far better than any notions of centralized state funding on a single statewide formula, but as we pointed out both in our brief and both of our briefs, and particularly in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.609" offset="1639905">It seems to us that if district power equalizing is a viable alternative, then this case has seized to be a case about education at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.156" offset="1694030">That we are no longer concerned with whether the children in the Edgewood School District have an education inferior to those in Alamo Heights because this would still be possible if the voters of Alamo Heights decided that they would assume a larger tax burden of the tax rate and the voter is Edgewood.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.223" offset="1766337">On the district power equalizing solution, this becomes a case for the release of the taxpayers rather than a case to help out school children.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.475" offset="1811372">Many of the writers who support drastic reform and who would support reform as a matter of constitutional judgment and said that the district power equalizing solution would, itself, be unconstitutional because it would make the number of dollars spent on a child depending on what his friends and neighbors think.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.963" offset="1901234">I must say that in view of what this--</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="450.241" offset="1906354">So there would still be an equal input and there could be.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.466" offset="1927252">There certainly could be.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.637" offset="1931954">In fact, the whole reason for having district power equalizing would be to unequal input possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="463.363" offset="1958912">But under the Texas system, it’s impossible for some districts to have a sufficient input even if they’re willing to tax themselves more.</text>

            <text syncTime="484.016" offset="2041459">Because we believe that our state foundation program has assured to every district the sufficient input for an adequate education and then it has left every district to decide for itself, “what, if anything more?”</text>

            <text syncTime="518.006" offset="2177400">I, of course, don’t think the proposition, one, appears in the small part of the Fourteenth Amendment so that if the Texas system in this respect resembles power equalizing, it doesn’t bother me but I would think that it should bother my friend, Mr. Gochman, and it should bother Professor Coons because I don’t see how the unequal input of power equalizing can be defended if the constitution says you can’t have any input.</text>

            <text syncTime="553.587" offset="2319820">It was found that many districts in Texas didn’t come up to that level and couldn’t really, under the former, because the property in the district just couldn’t predict the district to limit it and the state foundation program just doesn’t bring it up to a minimum level.</text>

            <text syncTime="624.891" offset="2604972">I think that there were certainly overtones of that in Yoder last term when the Court talked about a basic education in Court of what Thomas Jefferson had to say about it and things of that sort, so that I can understand what is a viable constitutional argument that a minimum education is required, but I don’t think there is any issue between the parties in this case on whether or not Texas is providing minimum education.</text>

            <text syncTime="680.380" offset="2826909">Their theory is that it doesn’t give Edgewood as much as Alamo Heights, that there is the constitutional violation and that is certainly the constitutional violation found by the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="757.137" offset="3134004">So that, in that sense, in terms of the marginal utility of the dollar, it would still be easier for wealthy people to vote to spend more money that it would for poor people to do so but, as Professor Coon says, it is brought as a matter upon which pragmatism must triumph over principle.</text>

            <text syncTime="1108.414" offset="4539079">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.694" offset="4552244">In the time that remains to me, I would like to turn for a moment to the factual assumptions that underlie the judgment below and the arguments of the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.345" offset="4618804">I would like to make perfectly clear what our position is with regard to those because there is some suggestion, particularly to the amicus briefs that’s part of the appellees, that Texas is asking this Court to resolve the very vexing questions on the relation of money to quality and education and on whether or not persons who are individually poor are not likely to be found in school districts that are in terms of taxable property, collectively poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.141" offset="4770001">We, of course, are not asking you to settle those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.826" offset="4788705">Our submission is that these are intensely difficult questions on which no answers in the present state of knowledge are possible and that this Court should not undertake to resolve matters on which educators and social scientists cannot come up with any answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.442" offset="4863206">We had felt it necessary to discuss the questions because, as we understand it, the position of our friends would require you to resolve these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.617" offset="4907928">The decision below, though it never discusses the issue, makes the implicit assumption that, in education, money is quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.713" offset="4944290">Now, the assumption is explicit in the writings of Professor Coons, his associates, and others who have written on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.307" offset="4978667">The District Court never spoke to it, but the District Court looked at figures about numbers of dollars spent and then announced a constitutional requirement that the quality of education cannot be allowed to vary except as a function of the wealth of the state as a whole and, thus, implicitly assumed what we think no Court can safely assume because, in fact, we are very skeptical that it is even true that, beyond some minimum, quality is money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.390" offset="5094964">The District Court did explicitly find that there is a correlation between poor people and poor school districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.660" offset="5148045">The finding of the District Court in that regard is based on the readings at the extremes of a chart that was offered in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.789" offset="5184616">Its determination in that regard has been criticized not only in our briefs and in our testimony at the trial, but in the literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.162" offset="5214083">In our brief, we set out the discussion of the finding on that point by Professor Goldstein in his article in the Pennsylvania law review and the issue of the Air Log Journal that was published in Tuesday of this week.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.710" offset="5264238">There is a lengthy student note that is, again, very critical of the finding in Rodriguez on that point that appears at page 1312, notes 40 and 41 of the Yale note and that the subject has is recurred to again at page 1327 of the Yale note on why you cannot undertake to conclude a correlation between individual poverty and district poverty on the basis of the kinds of figures that the district judge relied on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.347" offset="5402791">We’ve presented also in our briefs disinterested studies elsewhere in Kansas and in California that have said “no, this relation does not exist.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.903" offset="5445005">The central finding of the Yale note based on virtually complete data of the entire State of Connecticut and on a far more sophisticated statistical analysis than any I have seen anywhere in the literature is that there is no such relation in the State of Connecticut that, indeed, the relation tends to be an inverse one, that it is the poor people who live in the area where the most is being spent on education and the rich people live in the areas where the least is being spent on education.</text>

            <text syncTime="1408.279" offset="5738517">The Trial Court did not rely on it in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.772" offset="5764535">It put its holding squarely on the dollar inequality without regard to whether the particular plaintiffs were of Spanish ancestry or Anglo or Black, but the issue is certainly there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.605" offset="5823885">We think that the issue is one that is fairly readily answered that, although it is of course quite true that in the Edgewood District in Bexar County, Texas the great majority of the students are of Spanish origin and not as much money is spent there as in other school districts, but we doubt that this would be found to be true as a general matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.595" offset="5927852">But, the poor school districts are not that congruent with racial distributions that it is, in other words, a happenstance that we have a case in which we have particular plaintiffs who are Mexican-American and to live in a district with low taxable resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.485" offset="6027327">Again, on these factual statistical problems, we think that the state of the literature simply does not permit the conclusions that are essential to the position of my friend and that, even their conclusions were sent, we still think that our legal argument would have great merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.375" offset="6134951">But, if there are conclusions are not demonstrable at the present time because they are the essential premises of result for which they are due.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.830" offset="6172776">We think that the inability to demonstrate the accuracy of these assumptions is fatal to their case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1550.416" offset="6307046">The Court below held the Texas system unconstitutional because it distributes educational benefits on the basis of district wealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.474" offset="6347274">The Court said, as might be expected, those districts much-- most rich in property also have the highest median family income and the lowest percentage of minority pupils, while the poor districts are poor in income and predominantly minority in composition, and the Court cites one of the exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.830" offset="6416760">Another one is on page 98 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.382" offset="6434941">It pertains to exhibit 3 which shows that the correlation is not only on a district basis of minority discrimination, but on statewide-- on a statewide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.877" offset="6476946">The Court further found that there was no rational or compelling reason that could be offered for this invidious discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.749" offset="6528460">This Court is to decide whether or not to reverse the lower Court and approve district wealth as a proper basis for distributing public school education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.075" offset="6569733">The defendants admit that there is a perfect correlation between a property tax base per student and the amount of dollars each child gets for his education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.502" offset="6619470">Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan, tax rates do vary in Texas, but the district’s taxing at the highest rates in Texas get the lowest dollars per pupil, and the district’s taxing at the lowest rates gets the highest dollars per pupil and we showed it in exhibits, in Bexar County where my clients live, a metropolitan area, and we showed it statewide.</text>

            <text syncTime="3323.094" offset="13397828">Professor Coons and his associates supported that statement, Justice Rehnquist, by a figure showing that in California, for example, 59% of minority students live in districts in which the assessed values are above the medium and, therefore, if we had strict equalization they would get less now.</text>

            <text syncTime="3403.488" offset="13719343">I’m not here to apologize for the Texas school finance system, though I’ve said repeatedly, it seems to me, far from perfect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.927" offset="13761139">I think the Texas system does assure, as evidence in the record shows, more than merely a minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.164" offset="13790083">It ensures a basic education to every school child in the state and then lets districts, if they have money and want to spend money, go beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.639" offset="13831983">As I understand, the argument of my friend Mr. Gochman, it would not matter if Texas were giving each school district $2,000 per student.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.788" offset="13868554">If Alamo Heights were still free to tax with its heavy resources and spend more than Edgewood was, he would still find this to be impermissible although, for reasons that are not persuasive to me, he regards the same result as quite different if it stands from district power equalizing than it comes out of the mere facts as they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.841" offset="13972835">I said, several times, in my brief, I want to say here and say with the utmost sincerity how much I admire the creative scholarship of Professor Coons and his associates and my colleague Professor Yudof and others who are ripped in the field and I admire also the devotion and ability which Mr. Gochman has persevered in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.582" offset="14079728">These people have opened the eyes of the whole country to a very serious problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.949" offset="14109194">I think that everyone in this Courtroom would agree that what we want is better education for all children and especially for poor children, that the real differences between us are whether a new system should be adopted because this Court finds that the constitution requires it or whether we look to legislatures to provide remedies, and the difference about whether the proposals they make would, indeed, lead to better education or only more expensive education, whether they would relieve poor children or only children who happen to live in poor school districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.017" offset="14261436">And, indeed, if district power equalizing is to be taken seriously, whether the remedy that has been offered here is not one that is of no benefit to children but only of benefit to taxpayers.</text>
