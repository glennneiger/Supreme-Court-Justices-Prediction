            <text syncTime="11.834" offset="150758">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.867" offset="162879">This case is somewhat similar to the prior case.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.161" offset="183986">However, there are marked differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.395" offset="196942">In this case, Your Honors, just to orient the Court briefly, on July 29, 1969, Inspector Smyth went to the Gerak Theater in Greenwich Village and saw a movie, which is the subject of the litigation before this Court, Blue Moon and apparently felt that it was obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.931" offset="307075">He then communicated with the Prosecutor’s Office and on July 31, 1969, together with Just-- the Judge Arthur Goldberg, no relation to any judge in this Court, he returned to the theater and Judge Goldberg and Inspector Smyth saw the film again.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.440" offset="413132">At that point, after the film was completed at July 31, Judge Goldberg forthwith signed a search and seizure order without a hearing of any sort whatsoever and also issued warrants for the arrests of Mr. Heller, the petitioner here, and two other employees of the theater.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.511" offset="509367">As it turned out, of course, two of the three arrests should never have occurred because, before the beginning of trial my concession with the District Attorney, those two arrests were-- those two individuals were dismissed in the case because they should never have been arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.294" offset="572583">The issue as to whether or not they should’ve been an adversary hearing is preserved in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.116" offset="607796">It is the position of the petitioner that in a First Amendment situation that we have here, the general rule appertaining to search and seizures cannot be followed, that an adversary hearing is essential to protect vital First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.078" offset="691702">We have the seizure of a film.</text>

            <text syncTime="156.034" offset="727542">That’s correct because, first of all, we do not have a clear and pleasant danger here as we might if a person possessed munitions or narcotics or something of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.657" offset="778010">Indeed, we know from various cases and even from the history of this case before the New York Courts that there was sharp disagreement as to whether this film was even obscene and we do not, unlike our prior-- unlike the prior case, we do not for a moment concede that this was obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.017" offset="851466">In fact, we don’t think it was and, indeed, in the intermediate Appellate Court, the Appellate term of the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.247" offset="880410">The decision was two-to-one with Justice Markowitz dissenting and, in the New York Court of Appeals, the Chief Judge and another judge dissented and held that-- or said that the film was not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.445" offset="937148">So, we have a real sharp issue as to obscenity, but I want to pass what I consider to be an even more paramount issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="491.022" offset="2067414">That’s a possibility but, nonetheless, the seizure here amounted to what we consider to be a violation of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.572" offset="2125615">Now, the problem that arises, of course, is that the film itself is seized and it’s true that the District Attorney argues that, well, a motion to suppress can be promptly made.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.515" offset="2185383">But, he casts the burden upon the defendant to make such a motion and says that were the burden otherwise, in other words, if an adversary hearing had to be held before you could seize a film, then a defendant could delay such an adversary hearing and delay justice, but you can turn that right around.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.588" offset="2285693">The District Attorney asks this Court to assume that the District Attorney or other prosecutor would never delay such a proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.744" offset="2314324">That is not at all evident.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.499" offset="2321324">We’re not dealing with New York County alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.833" offset="2330728">We’re dealing with an overwriting consideration here.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.232" offset="2344312">There could be delay on the part of a prosecutor but, more important than that, when we deal with a First Amendment situation such as this where we have a theater with 299 seats, and this incidentally is a closed theater.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.901" offset="2402931">This is not a theater such as in a Rave or in the Roaden case where maybe you can see something from the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.384" offset="2432920">Mr. Heller who testified, who happens to be an attorney incidentally, testified that the-- there was a sign in the lobby of the theater that the film was marked X, that no one under 17 would be admitted and, indeed, he said they, including him, enforced a rule that no one apparently under 18 was admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.275" offset="2524453">There was no complaint received by any member of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.593" offset="2541693">This was a situation where the police, apparently protecting some unknown and anonymous person, were arrogating to themselves the right of censorship over films, decided to look at the films and “well, we’re going to seize this film.”</text>
            <text syncTime="624.410" offset="2601044">That’s about the size of it, and we maintain that the problem of not holding the adversary hearing, in essence, means that the prosecutor can arrogate to himself the right to seize the film and to put the theater out of business because most theaters book films, let’s say, for three, four days a week or so.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.495" offset="2693308">It’s not that easy once the film is seized suddenly, as was-- as happened here, to suddenly get another replacement film.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.180" offset="2720057">It’s quite difficult in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.164" offset="2727999">The arrest of the personnel is quite a traumatic effect, as indeed two of the three arrests here should not even have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.818" offset="2758614">And, the net result is that not only do you have an economic loss to the owner of the film, but you have a tremendous economic loss to the movie house, the exhibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.868" offset="2798843">Now, let us consider the situation where a prosecutor, perhaps not as liberal as some, decides that a particular movie is offensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.775" offset="2862477">That prosecutor, if he follows the procedure here, can handpick a judge and, incidentally, there’s no-- nothing in the record here one way or the other as to how Judge Goldberg was chosen to come down to Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.189" offset="2924126">So, we could-- we have a right at least to speculate that maybe this judge was handpicked, brought down, and he issues this forthwith warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.853" offset="2962787">Now, if Judge Markowitz, for example, who dissented in the Appellant term, had been used as the magistrate, there would not have been a seizure, there would not have been an arrest and, indeed, this case may not-- might not have even been up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.549" offset="3021615">So, w have that dangerous situation in a First Amendment case whereby the District Attorney can decide, perhaps subject to a certain ethics of course, and we don’t maintain that all prosecutors necessarily have the ethics of the New York County District Attorney’s Office, but the fact remains that the magistrate came down there and forthwith issued this search and seizure order and arrest order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1998.545" offset="8097520">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.633" offset="8109955">The state has, as this Court has held many times, a valid important interest in the prosecution of obscenity and the enforcement of the obscenity laws and that is a state interest which may be vindicated in any number of ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.382" offset="8188949">The state has a number of alternatives opened to it, and the Court has also held that if there is an important governmental interest which might incidentally limit protected speech that the Court must weigh the interest of the state on one hand and the procedures used so that the incidental effects can be minimized and that it is this tight of balance that must be decided in any given situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.250" offset="8304410">And, what have we here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.130" offset="8311933">We have here a situation where the state has chosen to use its penal statutes, its penal provisions which impose a penalty for the prior showing of the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.231" offset="8364283">That is, they do not aim at the future showing but only at the showing that occurred at some point in the past at some act the defendant has already performed and, in the course of enforcing this valid state interest of imposing a penalty for the past showing, the state of necessity must have evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.254" offset="8460413">And, in order to obtain evidence, there are two choices at this stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.275" offset="8480475">The state, in a case of a film, must have testi-- can have testimony of someone who has seen the film that testifies to its contents, or can have the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.428" offset="8529063">Now, if a person who has seen the film tries to testify, the problems of proof are, in many cases, overwhelming.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.633" offset="8565948">And I believe, as the summary of evidence which we have given in our brief indicates, any testimony concerning Blue Movie would have been very hard to discern by the tryer of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.314" offset="8612655">It is a type of movie which can be seen in its entirety, as it-- sorry, which must be seen in its entirety as the only way to ascertain what this movie is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.760" offset="8658422">The description is very difficult to do and, I say, even counsel, with great deal of leisure, have had difficulty attempting to summarize it in any useful form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.163" offset="8708054">Now, given this problem, why should the state be relegated to less than the best available probative evidence of a crime?</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.317" offset="8748596">Why must the state rely on secondary evidence which is really, in a case of this sort, worthless?</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.768" offset="8774405">Because, in this case, I would submit that a finder of fact would have had almost impossible task in figuring out what Blue Movie is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.012" offset="8807424">Now, they say the state has chosen the penal sanction, and I mention that because that distinguishes, in large part, many of the prior cases in this Court where states have tried a civil injunctive remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.171" offset="8864057">That is where the state has attempted to prevent future showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.943" offset="8883179">What we are doing here is enforcing a right against past showings.</text>

            <text syncTime="3822.463" offset="15393207">It may be ex parte, but that doesn’t necessarily make it deficient because in a judge-- in deciding the questions of obscenity, there are no questions of fact in the sense of an informant type of search warrant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3838.065" offset="15455587">It’s not a factual determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.923" offset="15463111">It’s an inference determination, an inference from basically a conceded fact, that is, the film is conceded to be here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3850.562" offset="15505638">And, to require the defendant’s presence with counsel and, conceivably, experts and we really don’t know what else, at this stage, would really be an unreasonable burden of a valid state interest, a valid state interest which this Court has upheld in saying that the prosecution of obscenity laws may be continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3873.427" offset="15597066">So that, we submit that the New York practice under which a magistrate seize a film prior to the issuance of a warrant of allegedly obscene material is constitutionally sufficient.</text>
