            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">We’ll hear arguments first this morning in number 71-364 and 71-373, consolidated cases in Mahan against Howell and Virginia Beach against Howell.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.802" offset="167560">Mr. Attorney General, you may proceed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_p_miller" startTime="19.048" stopTime="1211.348">
            <label>Mr. Andrew P. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="19.048" offset="180621">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.037" offset="196504">As Attorney General of Commonwealth, I am here today representing its State Board of Elections in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.104" offset="224820">I think it might be helpful if at the outset, I sketch very briefly the factual background involved here due to the complexities of that background.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.300" offset="269646">Under the revised Virginia Constitution, Article II, Section 6, reapportionment, unlike many states was required in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.180" offset="309144">Under schedule of that Constitution, Section 5, the Virginia General Assembly was required to convene in session on January 6, 1971 for the purpose of reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.188" offset="361179">As a result, two acts were adopted and the first, Section 24.1-12.1 establishing 52 districts for the Virginia House of Delegates.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.999" offset="408409">There are hundred members of that body.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.204" offset="417186">This plan consisted of single-member districts, multi-member districts and floater districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.524" offset="446443">Also, Section 24.1-14.1 establishing 40 single-member districts for the 40 member Senate of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.591" offset="494717">As soon as these acts were approved on March 1, 1971, they were forwarded to the Attorney General of the United States pursuant to the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.823" offset="547694">There were three suits bought and I’ll touch on them to the extent that they are relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.565" offset="570681">First, on March 8, by Mr. Duval alleging a failure to provide equal representation and also objecting to multi-member districts as such; By Mr. Perez, who is not here today, alleging a failure to provide equal representation and seeking the creation of a single multi-member district in Fairfax County, rather than the two multi-member districts consisting of five delegates each, which were created by the General Assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.500" offset="718430">That case was filed on March of 22. On the March the 2nd, the Attorney Governor Howell, who is here with us today, also filed a suit, again alleging failure of equal representation but that suit was limited to the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Senate Districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.020" offset="796484">Those districts are located in Norfolk and a portion of Virginia Beach.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.736" offset="815292">As I said earlier, they are single-member districts and cut across jurisdictional lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.432" offset="842146">In addition, the cities of Virginia Beach and Norfolk intervened.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.700" offset="859178">Mr. Frazier is here representing the City of Virginia Beach this morning and the City of Norfolk is not represented by counsel and there were a group of plaintiff interveners, taking the position that multi-member districts were inappropriate because of the fact that they constituted a delusion of the Negro vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.930" offset="944128">Mr. Howell, in his case, took the opposing position that in fact, the creation of single-member districts represented in the Norfolk-Virginia Beach area, a delusion of the Negro vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.640" offset="994910">And I want to emphasize the contrast that we have here because it shows how peculiarly these considerations are ones which a legislature such as the General Assembly of Virginia has great difficulty in solving.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.047" offset="1064605">There are different points of view with respect to multi-member and single-member districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.588" offset="1078711">Now, the different points of view as to what the effect to the creation of these districts are.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.010" offset="1096474">So the General Assembly was faced with exceedingly difficult task.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.884" offset="1111939">The Lower court found that variations existed in their plans, which exceeded what the court considered permissible limits on the basis of numbers only.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.675" offset="1167109">As to the House of Delegates, the Court proceeded to draw its own plan rather than allowing the General Assembly to proceed once the constitutional guidelines have been established to the Court and the same thing occurred with respect to the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.898" offset="1228027">The Court's House of District Plan, house of delegates plan, fragmented various governmental entities within the Commonwealth, shifted one delegate from the Tidewater area to Northern Virginia, denied, Mr. Duval’s prayer for single-member districts and denied, Mr. Perez’ prayer for a large multi-member district in Fairfax County.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.678" offset="1319142">The plan itself resulted in a variation from norm of some 10.27%, this is the Court plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.852" offset="1351847">As for the Senate, the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Districts, which I refer to, the Court found that the population of those districts were almost at the norm, but because of a housing sample relating to some 36,000 sailors who were counted by the census in Norfolk because of the fact that the ships they are on are “home-ported” at Norfolk.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.756" offset="1459472">This census showing that some 21,000 of these individuals had addresses outside of the Fifth Senatorial District in which the naval base is located, established a multi-membered district consisting of the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Senatorial Districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.904" offset="1540033">In other words, those districts were combined into a single district which of course, represented an anomaly as far as the Senate plan is concerned because otherwise it was completely a single district plan as desired by the General Assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.262" offset="1601473">I want to mention before I proceed further, certain dates because I think they will set the background for what I will be addressing myself to.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.392" offset="1642015">On May 7, I already mentioned that the plans were forwarded to the Attorney General of the United States, the Attorney General filed with State objections under the Voting Rights Act in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.187" offset="1685170">One, the division line between Senate Districts five and six which I have just referred to, and also to the five multi-member districts in the House, that objection being based on the Lower court decision in the case of Chavis versus Whitcomb.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.921" offset="1756118">On May the 10th, the General Assembly reconvened, but this Court had not decided the Chavis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.591" offset="1782763">The Lower court had not acted and consequently, the General Assembly recessed to await the Chavis decision and to give the time for the Court to act with respect to these suits which were pending before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.778" offset="1847547">On May the 24th, the Court entered an order on first hearing, which said in essence that on or before June 15th, 1971, Virginia was to adopt and submit to the Attorney General of the United States, curative legislation with respect to the two objections I have just mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.622" offset="1926855">If that were not done by that date, then the Court would proceed the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.772" offset="1947439">On June the 3rd, the General Assembly came back into session.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.979" offset="1964262">Senate Bill 125 was introduced to cure the Attorney General's objections to the Senate plan, which constituted the drawing of a single line between the fifth and sixth Districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.349" offset="2013790">And then, the General Assembly recessed until June, the 7th, to await this Court’s decision in Chavis versus Whitcomb.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.206" offset="2045241">On June the 7th, Chavis versus Whitcomb was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.634" offset="2058930">The Attorney General of the United States withdrew his objections to the House plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.190" offset="2081186">The General Assembly passed Senate Bill 125, curing the objection with respect to the Senate line in districts five and six.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.985" offset="2120370">Consequently, the Court’s order, which I refer to on May 24th, was fully complied with and so the General Assembly recessed until August 16th, the subject of course, to being reconvened earlier for the Court to decide the issues before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.517" offset="2186512">On June the 16th, there was such a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.818" offset="2195707">On July the 2nd, the Court in its order found the plans constitutionally defective, but instead of permitting the General Assembly to come back into session and to act on the guidelines established in the Court’s opinion as to what in fact would be a constitutionally appropriate, reapportionment plan proceeded to mandate on itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.889" offset="2295912">On July 8th, the General Assembly reconvened, directed the Attorney General of the Commonwealth to appeal the case to the Supreme Court of the United States and adjourn since there was nothing further, which the General Assembly of Virginia could do under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.372" offset="2361846">Thus today, we start a second round or second decade of reapportionment litigation with the hope that guidelines maybe established in order that states throughout the country will not be faced with subsequent rounds of litigation as to what in fact is constitutionally permitted in terms of the drawing of legislated district lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.074" offset="2468739">I want to address myself for a few minutes to the House plan and then to the Senate plan and then I will cease at that point and Mr. Frazier will deliver his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.413" offset="2514087">With respect to the House, the lower court’s decision was based on numbers and numbers alone when it struck down the validity of the Virginia House and Delegate's plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.773" offset="2559540">The lower court relying on this Court’s previous decisions in Kirkpatrick and Wells, both of course being congressional redistricting cases, not state legislative cases, found variations exceeding those which were struck down in those two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.238" offset="2641356">Now, if numbers must be the sole criteria of the Virginia plan, we submit that the Court should not have looked only at the maximum variation of plus 9.6% and minus 6.8% depending on the calculations of the floater district concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.361" offset="2725888">It should have considered that of 52 house districts, 35 were within 4% of the norm, that of 52 house districts, only two exceeded 8%, that of 52 house districts, the average deviation from the norm was only 3.8%, that of the 52 house districts, a majority of the delegates elected by or in those districts would be elected by 49.3% of the population of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.410" offset="2850022">But we further submit that numbers and numbers alone viewed in the manner in which the lower court viewed them on the overall aspect as I have just presented them to you, cannot be what this Court meant in Reynolds versus Sims when it stated that “one man, one vote” means an individual is entitled to fair and effective representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.792" offset="2939570">That is the constitutional criteria which we submit must be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.234" offset="2957333">It cannot be numerically measured alone for purposes of State legislative reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.487" offset="2982306">But it can be, we submit, measured by two-pronged test.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.514" offset="2998502">One, is the apportionment of the house in question based on a permissible standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.652" offset="3027028">Two, there is the plan approached population equality as closely as possible in consistency with that rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.964" offset="3068301">The rationale of the Virginia plan is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.369" offset="3081885">It is one suggested by this Court that a State can accord political subdivisions, some independent representation and at least one body of the State legislature, as long as the basic standard of equality of population among districts is maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.327" offset="3157744">That was the rationale adopted in Virginia and today it is more important than ever before under the newly adopted Virginia Constitution because under this Constitution which went into effect in 1971, counties of which we have 95 in the State as well as cities are given the opportunity to have enacted for them numerous local or special legislation applicable to specific problems which that jurisdiction as a jurisdiction, maybe confronted with.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.476" offset="3274250">Now the second test that we suggest was also met.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.074" offset="3288670">The lower court specifically found that disparities in the Virginia plan cannot be reduced at all if the integrity of political subdivisions are mandated.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.008" offset="3344468">No plan has been presented, which keeping intact local political subdivision boundaries for one House of a bicameral legislature achieves closer population equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.846" offset="3395772">How then can the lower court’s decision as to the house plan be upheld?</text>
            <text syncTime="827.868" offset="3415834">Only in two ways, neither of which were sustainable in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.164" offset="3433075">First that the Court finds, that the rationale or the Virginia plan, is one that is not permissible or is one that was not rationally applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.960" offset="3476229">According to political subdivisions, independent representation is, we submit, permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.339" offset="3501725">The policy of Virginia in this regard was rationally applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.435" offset="3522100">Appellant Duval's argument that there is no provision in the Virginia constitution allowing independent representation ignores a basic constitutional principle and that is that a State Constitution is a document of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.704" offset="3571210">Nothing in Virginia’s Constitution prohibits according to political subdivisions independent representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.503" offset="3602453">Virginia has not abandoned her policy, a traditional policy of according political subdivisions independent representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.766" offset="3631501">She did change this policy as far as the Senate is concerned but clearly, in light with this Court’s language and opinion in Reynolds versus Sims, this does not mandate an abandonment of this policy in the House also.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.936" offset="3684164">In fact, the design of Virginia’s reapportionment was to balance the two Houses of her General Assembly in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.972" offset="3720317">The only other manner in which the decision of the Lower court can be sustained is if this Court now decides that the principles of congressional redistricting are also applicable to legislative redistricting.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.032" offset="3768487">We submit, they are none; for if there were numbers and numbers alone which we're concerned with, there would be no need to determine whether various rationales, as suggested by this Court in previous opinions could be applied because the only rationale would be numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.101" offset="3836824">There would be no need to determine whether one House of a bicameral legislature balances inequities in another House.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.854" offset="3867857">Now for this Court to make applicable to legislative redistricting, the congressional redistricting decisions would repudiate its past enunciation that numbers and numbers alone, though most important, are not the sole criteria, that a balancing concept of a bicameral legislature is constitutionally acceptable, and that the maintenance of political subdivisions is a permissible, a rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.978" offset="3968272">Congressional redistricting, allocating representatives to Congress is entirely different from allocating State delegates for each State’s legislative processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.210" offset="4009232">The relationship of congressional districts to the Federal Government simply cannot be compared with that of legislative districts or to a State Government for reasons I have previously assigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.968" offset="4052281">There is one other way in which the court’s decision below may be sustained and that is for this Court to agree with everything that has been stated here today, within the State that nonetheless percentage variation is impermissible, that the percentage is too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.951" offset="4116229">But for this Court to say that would be saying it on the basis of numbers and numbers alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.665" offset="4139008">For we have already demonstrated that Virginia has applied a permissible rationale in a consisted manner and we have come as close to population equality as possible in conformity with that rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.926" offset="4196059">The last aspect to the lower court’s decision, which affected the House of Delegates plan was the removal of the delegate from Tidewater area to Northern Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.306" offset="4229601">This was done essentially on the basis of projected population growth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.424" offset="4250081">The Virginia General Assembly did not use population projections and this non-use, we submit, is permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.255" offset="4277457">In any event, to apply the population projections only in one part of the State rather than utilize them consistently and rationally throughout the State, clearly is contrary to the Ad Hoc application, which this Court discouraged in Kirkpatrick.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.434" offset="4338166">I do not have to stand here and argue why the General Assembly did not use population projection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.021" offset="4356451">As seen in the appendix at page 66, the projections on the basis of fertility assumptions, industrial development, present and planned highway and many other considerations, all of which the General Assembly felt too speculative for proper utilization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.220" offset="4421235">As far as the Senate is concerned, there is one simple issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.909" offset="4440043">May apportionment be based on the decennial census or must have been based on a sample housing survey conducted by a review of zip codes. Virginia adopted two policies with respect to the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.615" offset="4490825">The first policy was that the entire Senate would consist of single-member districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.279" offset="4509529">One does not have to read many cases to come to the conclusion that this is a matter peculiarly within the expertise of various state legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.316" offset="4545682">And the second choice that Virginia made was the adoption of a total population apportionment base.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.550" offset="4570551">Obviously, there are various basis which a state might adopt, but in Virginia, the intent, as demonstrated in the debates of the Virginia constitutional revisions as quoted in our reply brief on page 8, was for redistricting to include every human being living and counted, balloted at decennial census of the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.936" offset="4668144">That means that the lower court was faced with what we submit, were two valid constitutional policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.641" offset="4690923">It ignored both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.228" offset="4697297">It found that the apportionment base was not proper simply because a sample zip code housing survey showed that of the 36,000 sailors enumerated aboard vessels, approximately 50% had addresses outside the Fifth Senatorial District.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.602" offset="4754766">If the Court had bothered to consistently apply this sample housing survey, it would have seen that the survey at least purported to show that not only that 18,000 had addresses outside the fifth senatorial district, but that approximately half of these addresses, in other words 9,000 or 9,500 were outside of the fifth, sixth and seventh senatorial districts because they lived in other jurisdictions in the Hampton roads area, the cities of Portsmouth and Chesapeake, the cities of Newport News and Hampton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.737" offset="4887364">And I think it is well-settled that a State has great latitude in choosing its own apportionment base and I submit that the base chosen by Virginia is constitutionally permissible and consequently should be approved by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1224.601" offset="5002825">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.347" offset="5017767">The City of Virginia Beach stands shoulder by shoulder with the Commonwealth of Virginia in upholding the General Assembly’s House redistricting plan and in urging the reversal of the District Court decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.279" offset="5081506">The City of Virginia Beach is not involved in the senate side of the controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.785" offset="5111495">Our position here this morning is that a State reapportionment plan should be judged not solely on mathematical comparisons, but it should be judged also on the quality of the representation that it affords the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.414" offset="5186100">Now, it seems to us that this Court cannot uphold the District Court below, without overruling a great deal of what this Court said in Reynolds against Sims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.575" offset="5246704">The District Court plan itself contains significant deviations from population equality without any policy justification whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.717" offset="5295292">The District Court said in its opinion this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.434" offset="5310130">“While we have endeavored to reach a perfect mathematical division, we had been unable to do so because of the multiplicity of delegates, the geography of the State, and the diversity of population concentrations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.563" offset="5366659">So, if you look at numbers and that’s all the District Court did, its own plan comes up with a variation of 10% but no basis of that was given, no effort was made to justify that kind of variation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.610" offset="5442832">As the Attorney General has pointed out, the greater variation in the Virginia plan was the result of a rational basis, a desire to preserve the integrity of political subdivisions and to give them an effective voice in one House of the General Assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.312" offset="5521617">Now, if the District Court was serious in what it said and was going to abide by the numbers alone, it could have done a whole lot better job than it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.603" offset="5562786">So, without being able to do better than it did and without affording any basis whatsoever for its position, we think its plan must fall.</text>

            <text syncTime="1375.694" offset="5607194">Mr. Frazier, wouldn’t there be some questions as to the propriety of the District Court being a source of policy judgments as to what factors are to be considered other than numbers?</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry Frazier, III</label>
            <text syncTime="1388.893" offset="5659961">Very definitely, we feel that this Court has leaned over backwards on occasion after occasion to say that policy decision is one for the legislature, not for the District Court at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.228" offset="5717326">And we propose to emphasize this in several ways before we are through today but we feel and one of their arguments is that there is a fundamental violation of due process when the District Court arbitrarily took the bit in its teeth and said, this is your plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.838" offset="5807710">This, we think is a second, but very important phase of the problem before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.830" offset="5843759">Now, returning to the basic problem of State reapportionment, we think that a fundamental principle here is that Reynolds rejects mathematical precision as a constitutional requirement and recognizes the validity of representation of political subdivisions as such.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="1457.006" offset="5932471">As I understand, in your position, Mr. Frazier, it is that there is a substantial difference between what is constitutionally required under Article I, Section 2, with respect to congressional apportionment or districting, from what is required under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution and specifically, the Equal Protection Clause with respect to reapportionment of state legislatures and that this Court has consistently recognized that difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.927" offset="6084086">Do you take -- is that your position?</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="1497.586" offset="6094744">And the Wesberry against Sanders which was based on Article I, Section 2 illustrates that in particularly when one reads Mr. Justice Clark’s opinion different from the Court saying that in Wesberry against Sanders, he would apply the different test of the Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_frazier_iii" startTime="1515.489" stopTime="2090.172">
            <label>Mr. Harry Frazier, III</label>
            <text syncTime="1515.489" offset="6166319">And as that is brought down today in Kirkpatrick, the phrase as nearly as practicable appears whereas in Reynolds, construing the Equal Protection Clause, it is substantial equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.403" offset="6218041">And what we are faced with today, I believe, is the first opportunity the Court has had to decide the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.730" offset="6259315">What worry -- what right are we headed in the decade of the 70’s?</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.291" offset="6277601">Do they mean the same thing, these phrases, or do they not?</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.402" offset="6294006">We, of course, submit that they do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.050" offset="6304559">Now, we find that there is no place, no valid place in the Congress of the United States for a representation of political subdivisions as such because in Congress, we are concerned with the formulation of national policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.488" offset="6382299">And the interest of the states are being represented, yes, but cities, counties, we do not see that there is any basis that we can argue here for our saying that they need to be separately heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.592" offset="6438724">And I think this is evidenced by the historical fact that for the first 50 years of our country, you had at large representations in many congressional districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.267" offset="6485431">But there is a place in the States for this type of representation and we think this Court specifically so stated in Reynolds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.127" offset="6536944">Local government entities are frequently charged with various responsibilities incident to the operation of State Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.412" offset="6565992">In many states, much of the legislature’s activity involves the enactment of so-called local legislation directed only to the concerns of political subdivisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.753" offset="6611446">We see no reason why that is not as valid today as it was in 1964 and when we look at the Commonwealth of Virginia and the session of its General Assembly, most recently held, a 104 of a 133 local bills were introduced in the House of Delegates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.430" offset="6698068">This is where the localities find their primary voice and their primary source of representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.538" offset="6730564">So, that we think, has a rational basis to support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.516" offset="6750417">We feel that there are numbers of phrases, points, in the Reynolds decision that must be overlooked, swept out under the rug if the decision of the lower court is to be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.775" offset="6823455">Now, what is the result of affirming that decision of the lower court?</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.656" offset="6847070">First, reapportionment will then be reduced to a mathematical exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.415" offset="6874028">If this Court is to say today, Kirkpatrick governs congressional and State reapportionment then all we got to do is become a slave to numbers maybe even to computers and little judgment will be exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.816" offset="6943619">As Mr. Justice Rehnquist has pointed out, policy decisions were no longer be permitted in how you structure at least one House of the Legislature, either House of the Legislature, you do it by the numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.121" offset="7000879">Then we would be concerned only with the extremes of the variations in the numbers and that’s what the District Court did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.179" offset="7029091">It took the most over-represented, the most under-represented, and added up the percentages and said, that’s bad, we can’t have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.049" offset="7056572">You do it our way and this is our plan, but what happens here, you have no quality of representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.830" offset="7087710">No consideration of who the people in a given jurisdiction can vote for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.539" offset="7110593">Political subdivisions will be largely ignored as such, this mix of rendering obsolete bicameral legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.043" offset="7152598">What will be the difference between the Senate and the House of Delegates in the Commonwealth of Virginia or any other of the states?</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.198" offset="7181228">The differences would merely be how long the members are elected for and how many people they represent; the size of the districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.253" offset="7213411">The only validity that I can see for affirming the District Court would be to achieve the uniformity in congressional and state reapportionment mechanics, possibly this would cut down on the amount of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.143" offset="7272970">I am not a bit sure that it would but what is the prize that you pay for doing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.683" offset="7291152">We think there is a loss of quality in representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.674" offset="7307139">We think the fallacy of the District Court numbers game is demonstrated very clearly in the case of the City of Virginia Beach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.068" offset="7348621">What happened at Virginia Beach?</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.239" offset="7357398">The General Assembly’s plan there was not perfect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.705" offset="7371191">According to Mr. DuVal’s theory of valuing floater delegates, Virginia Beach was represented -- under represented by 7.3%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.170" offset="7409121">The District Court reduced that under representation to approximately 2.5%, but it took 29,000 Virginia Beach citizens, put them over into Norfolk’s multimember district, where they now vote with 307,000 people in a seven-member district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.795" offset="7491563">So, what has happened to the quality of the representation for those 29,000 people?</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.740" offset="7511312">They’re not a part of Virginia Beach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.624" offset="7518939">They must vote for Norfolk and how will the delegates in the General Assembly from Norfolk feel if a matter comes before the General Assembly that pits Norfolk, the interest of Norfolk against that of Virginia Beach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.425" offset="7570139">Obviously, they’re not going to go with the 29,000; they’re going to go with the 307,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.040" offset="7592605">The District Court has sacrificed the community interest of Virginia Beach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.535" offset="7614548">Now, this is done too in the Senate because 40,000 members of the Senate, in the Senate -- 40,000 of Virginia Beach people in the Senate district are combined with 75,000 Norfolk citizens in a multimember district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.460" offset="7678286">I am sorry what was started off as a single-member district, it is now a multimember district; 40,000 Virginia Beach citizens and 307,000 Norfolk citizens, the same sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.116" offset="7728859">Now, we could live with this in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.575" offset="7746727">We find it hard to live with, in both Houses where the discrimination against Virginia Beach is so pointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.166" offset="7781104">One right to have solved this, if the Court is the final arbiter of these political decisions, was not to take 29,000 from Virginia Beach and put them over in Norfolk’s multimember district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.978" offset="7836275">It would have been to move one seat to Virginia Beach and take 13,000 Norfolkians and put them into the Virginia Beach, saying, to reverse the flow, if you will, to balance some equities but the Court didn’t do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.504" offset="7894371">This comes back to a question of remedies, to a question of policy on which the City of Virginia Beach had no say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.463" offset="7926241">But coming back to the subject of community interest to making effective representation in the General Assembly for political subdivisions, Norfolk and Virginia Beach sit side by side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.157" offset="7985068">They’re different types of cities, they have different problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.267" offset="8001473">The City of Norfolk in its brief has painted this picture very clearly, much more clearly, I am afraid, than I could have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.001" offset="8036373">It is pointed out that the interest of budding political subdivisions can be adverse and then it lists areas in which they are adverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.262" offset="8081408">In the question of water supply or the regulation of water rates and services, Norfolk has got all the water; Virginia Beach has none.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.221" offset="8117248">Virginia Beach has to rely on Norfolk for water service and in matters of this area, if legislative policy is involved, their interests are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.919" offset="8164059">The piggy-back income tax is something that Norfolk would desperately like to have as would any core city.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.158" offset="8197078">Virginia Beach of a different nature would not like to have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.291" offset="8213588">So, community interests are sacrificed, not only in Virginia Beach, in the case that I am concerned with, but they are sacrificed everywhere that the District Court has moved lines around to disregard the integrity, purposefully accorded political subdivisions by the General Assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.237" offset="8293313">Nothing is being given in return for getting mathematical equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.088" offset="8316719">There are at least nine counties and two cities in the State that have suffered by having bunches of their people arbitrarily put here or there by the District Court plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.831" offset="8367710">So, Virginia Beach is a prime example of what happens when the political subdivisions are ignored in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.398" offset="8405953">Now, coming to the remedies in the case, there are many remedies that were available here if the District Court had found the General Assemblies plan to have been invalid.</text>

            <text syncTime="2200.768" offset="8907504">Well, I think their position is that the General Assembly’s plan was acceptable and should have been upheld and this is a justification in terms of their particular circumstances for upholding the General Assembly’s plan and reversing the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.996" offset="8988379">Now, my time is approximately up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.186" offset="9009173">What I wanted to get back to is the matter of remedies which in the substantive -- in the importance of the substantive area cancel easily be overworked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.875" offset="9047939">What we are saying here is that the General Assembly should have been given an opportunity to correct this situation if correction was needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.004" offset="9084406">The General Assembly was standing by, willing to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.699" offset="9095168">It had time to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.954" offset="9100184">It could act quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.581" offset="9106766">It has acted effectively before when it has been told to correct its reapportionment, but it was not accorded that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.904" offset="9136024">At the worst, the Court could have said, “Alright, hold your 1971 elections under this plan but fix it for next time” And that’s what it did and what it specifically approved in the Arizona case, Ely versus Klahr where three successive reapportionment plans had been declared unconstitutional and the District Court still said, “Okay, hold it under this invalid plan, but fix it for next time.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.558" offset="9254619">Now, even if the District Court should be so bold as to write its own plan, the basic concepts of due process require that you at least give the parties an opportunity to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.192" offset="9301117">Here, there was no indication as to what the Court would do on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.120" offset="9328912">It hadn’t said the State’s plan was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.305" offset="9341659">It had not made any effort. No parties had come forward and talked about specific relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.602" offset="9366841">How could Virginia Beach have known that 29,000 of its people would be summarily dumped into a mammoth district over in Norfolk?</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.467" offset="9398293">These interests were never given any chance to be heard, so that regardless of the validity of the General Assembly’s plan in an unfairness and violation of due process by the District Court demands reversal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2345.489" offset="9486378">Mr. Chief Justice and justices, I represent the plaintiffs in the suit that was filed on March 3rd challenging the validity of a certain portion of the Senate reapportionment of council as Senator Peter Babalas of Norfolk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.334" offset="9561715">Our case was separate, but we come up here on a unitary opinion that dealt with two separate cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.609" offset="9594838">At the outset, if Your Honors please, it’s often important to know that the Constitution of Virginia was changed since the day that I had the privilege of sharing the side with the distinguished Attorney, Mr. Edmund Campbell and argue Mann v. Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.068" offset="9672683">When we argued Mann v. Davis, the rule that governs reapportionment of Congress that the district shall be contiguous has become compact and contained as nearly as practicable the same number of inhabitants which contained in one section of our Constitution and that language was not embodied in another section which merely said, that we should reapportion the State legislature every ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.517" offset="9790443">But when the people went to the polls in 1970 to amend the Constitution, they dictated that the same test for congressional reapportionment, governed state legislative reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.393" offset="9845927">So, if this distinguished tribunal has taken the Virginia case to hand down a ruling that they should be a more given the joints when it comes to cutting the legislative pie into a 100 slices then they should be in the slicing of the congressional pie into 10 slices, it’s the wrong case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2648.953" offset="10700236">When the Navy has enough trouble of its own without undertaking the 100 years of experience, the Department of Commerce has acquired through the Census Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.520" offset="10750495">So, you will find in the exhibits, if Your Honor please a typical military approach to taking the census.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.360" offset="10781842">They sent them on to aboard the ships, signed a certificate is to how many crew members are assigned to vessels “home-ported” in this example at Norfolk, Virginia on the day we take the census.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.771" offset="10843491">Count on as if they lived aboard the ships and had no family homes in the Norfolk area and in that mandate and I do not blame the Department of Navy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.513" offset="10898453">If I criticize anybody I would criticize the Census Department for delegating to the Navy a very sophisticated task and that is of counting the total number of habitants within the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.309" offset="10953624">But having seen that we have 50,000 people behind that fence, if we were to just take this arbitrary Census Tract, Census Tract 000999.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.948" offset="11016213">It consists of these little white lines projecting out into the Elizabeth River known as the piers at the naval base and we have as an exhibit the total number of vessels that were “home-ported” at these piers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.305" offset="11077653">And there were 38,000 people that were considered as being residents along this pier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.458" offset="11114224">When in fact -- now we are not just relaying upon the testimony of Professor Reed who had some 30 years experience as a census enumerator and whose documents are well established in the transcript, but we had un-contradicted testimony of Admiral Cob who was a commandant of the Fifth Naval District and Mr. Bergmannsheil, the Assistant Administrative from Management to the Fifth Naval District and both of them testified without contradiction that at least 50% of the people that were counted in 000999 along those piers actually lived with their families, their wives and children in other sections of the general area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.590" offset="11310770">So, if Your Honor please, on this we are going to subscribe to a phantom population as being in compliance with what I think was a magnificent principle that restored Representative Government throughout this nation and State legislative bodies and in Congress too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.205" offset="11393212">If we go for phantom populations, we have destroyed the vitality of “one person, one vote” and then you will see all kind of phantom schemes for artificially complying with having nearly as practicable, the same number of inhabitants.</text>

            <text syncTime="2842.152" offset="11473042">How far would your argument Mr. Howell, your claim here is that it was unconstitutional to accept census figures for the reason that you have explained that census figures with respect to a certain district in Norfolk were invalid and unsound and inaccurate because the census with respect to that district delegated the job to the navy which did it by counting the number of men on the ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.973" offset="11572308">I understand your claim as to why the census figures were invalid?</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.108" offset="11588817">And you therefore say that it was unconstitutional to accept census figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.817" offset="11623612">Now, does that mean that in every case it’s up to the courts or the legislatures to go behind the census figures and if they find it for some reason or another, they think they are inaccurate that they are not allowed to follow them?</text>

            <text syncTime="2894.312" offset="11681604">If Your Honor please, the enumeration of the total number of inhabitants was sufficient for the purpose of the census.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.391" offset="11717966">The census was first taken in 1790 for the sole purpose of reapportioning Congress and the un-contradicted testimony of Mr. Conrad Toper (ph) is that there is no factor considered in the taking of the census that is relevant to state legislative reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.321" offset="11785676">And so, I say to you that the enumeration of the total number of inhabitants within the second congressional district was entirely accurate because all they have to do is be spread through that total area and these people were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.099" offset="11840742">They were either on ships or living in apartments and houses with their wives and children like every other American who has a job on land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.241" offset="11885359">What I say is that when you have a substantial impact of people who might find and fall in the category of sailors and the state doesn't want to take the time to find where they actually live, whether they live aboard ship or live with their wives and children you defuse it by at large elections.</text>

            <text syncTime="3719.845" offset="14983795">I am appearing as counsel pro se.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.387" offset="14993930">I was a lead plaintiff in the lower court action which we challenge the Virginia General Assembly’s House of Delegate plan, and as the result of which the lower court throughout the assembly’s plan adopted its own reapportionment plan for the House of Delegates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.274" offset="15057460">I am interested in only the house of delegate plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.423" offset="15070104">We did not challenge the Senate plan in any respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.842" offset="15083792">At the beginning of my argument, I would like to make claim to the Court that I diametrically disagree with the Attorney General and counsel for Virginia Beach who apparently believe that this Court can affirm the lower court only on the Kirkpatrick versus Priesler basis of mathematical exactness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.555" offset="15154636">This is certainly not the case, in my opinion, and I would urge upon the Court that there is ample authority by which you could affirm the lower court’s decision on the basis of the basic cases in State reapportionment matters, that is Reynolds versus Sims, Roman versus Sincock and Swann versus Adams.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.397" offset="15233944">I’m just saying, Mr. Justice Stewart that I believe the Court has ample authority to affirm the lower court’s decision on the basis of the long standing cases such as Reynolds, Roman versus Sincock and Swann versus Adams.</text>

            <text syncTime="3797.543" offset="15294548">The basic state reapportionment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.515" offset="15302489">I am well aware of the Kirkpatrick holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.522" offset="15314505">I know that this matter is under discussion in the Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.026" offset="15328507">I’m not interested in the outcome in this case because I rely basically on the Swann case written by Mr. Justice White, In which case, the Court held that the issue on evaluating the constitutional validity of the State legislative reapportionment scheme is whether “there has been faithful adherence to a plan of population-based representation with such minor deviations only as may occur in recognizing certain factors that are free from many taint of arbitrariness or discrimination.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.051" offset="15460582">Now, the position that I am taking here is that the assembly, House of Delegates’ plan flunked the test set down and the statement I just read you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.698" offset="15499139">And then first of all because it discriminated against Northern Virginia as a region in the House of Delegates plan and that was arbitrary and discriminatory and within the band that I just mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.654" offset="15550966">This Court in 1971, specifically condemned a plan that has such a taint of arbitrariness or discrimination in Abate versus Mundt in which Justice Marshall wrote and I quote, “We have underscored the danger apportionment structures that contain a built-in bias tend to favor the particular geographic areas or political interests or which necessarily will tend to favor for example less popular districts over their more highly populated neighbors,” citing Hadley versus Junior College District.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.464" offset="15686280">Now, the facts, we believe clearly show discrimination against the number of districts and seats represented in the Northern Virginia area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.874" offset="15723896">Thus all 19 seats in Northern Virginia, delegate seats were underrepresented by an average of 4.3%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.628" offset="15758900">In terms of population, Northern Virginia was underrepresented by 38,100 persons.</text>

            <text syncTime="3935.194" offset="15845209">We are underrepresented by a small amount as of the 1970 census but because of our very rapidly growing population, our population as of August 1 actually would have entitled less to 21 delegates, not just 20 or 19 but 21 under the 46,485 ideal population.</text>
            <text syncTime="3955.499" offset="15926397">Now, under the assembly passed reapportionment redistricting plans, in the conventional redistricting plan, Northern Virginia was entitled to a -- by its population to 20% of the congressional seats and it got them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.232" offset="15985330">In the Senate plan, it got 20% of the senate seats.</text>
            <text syncTime="3973.221" offset="15997241">But in the House plan, it was given only 19% and of course that’s what brought us in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.084" offset="16020752">We felt that this discrimination against this us particularly unfair because of the population growth trends.</text>
            <text syncTime="3985.992" offset="16048337">Northern Virginia for the last decade and now is growing much more rapidly than the rest of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.058" offset="16072579">In the last decade, its growth rate, average annual growth rate was three times that of the rest of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.188" offset="16097134">And this Court has held in a number of decisions, a Virginia case that came before you on reapportionment, Davis versus Mann and Kilgarlin versus Hill and then Kirkpatrick that it is proper for the legislature and for reapportioning Court to consider the matter of growth and population.</text>
            <text syncTime="4016.230" offset="16169336">In Kilgarlin in fact, the Court approved a over representation of one particular area because the District Court showed that that was a very rapidly growing district.</text>
            <text syncTime="4027.005" offset="16212386">Though we say that the assembly plan not only discriminated against Northern Virginia, but the other side of it was that there was substantial over representation or a bias in favor of the Tidewater area and thus as to 11 Tidewater delegate seats and there was an over representation by an average of 7% per seat.</text>

            <text syncTime="4080.797" offset="16427635">Yes, it was a convenient way of considering Northern Virginia as a district already regularized by state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4087.489" offset="16454384">In the same way most of the Tidewater jurisdictions are lumped in a particular planning district down there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.303" offset="16477581">When I speak of Tidewater, I’m again speaking of a planning district identified in affect the Tidewater communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4102.459" offset="16514257">As I say, 11 Tidewater delegates seats were overrepresented by 7% a piece.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.513" offset="16534424">The population in the Tidewater would represent an over representation of 36,650 persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4115.214" offset="16565248">On the basis of these facts that I have reported to you, the lower court, we say found that there was discrimination on a built-in bias against Northern Virginia and favor of Tidewater, not in those exact words but the lower court found pervasive under representation in districts in Northern Virginia, and over representation in Tidewater.</text>
            <text syncTime="4136.948" offset="16652184">As a result of which, one delegate seat was removed from Tidewater and transferred to Northern Virginia to eliminate this built-in bias.</text>

            <text syncTime="4157.386" offset="16733895">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.850" offset="16735775">There is a planning, at least there is a planning district under state laws set forth in my brief at page 4 here, as used here in Tidewater area means the counties of Isle of Wight, Mount Simon, South Hampton, cities of Chesapeake, Franklin, Norfolk, Portsmouth, Suffolk and Virginia Beach.</text>
            <text syncTime="4175.395" offset="16805992">For certain State purposes these jurisdictions are grouped in State planning district 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.247" offset="16833369">Now, my second point is that the -- of course were objectionable population deviations in this plan that do not meet the Swann test of minor variations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4193.020" offset="16876523">I emphasize this only really as these deviations reflect the bias and discrimination that we believe was present in the House of Delegates plan enacted by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="4204.414" offset="16922081">Percentage wise, including all the districts and there were four floaters here, the overall variation from population equality between smallest and biggest district was 23.6%.</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.250" offset="16969415">The total population difference between biggest and smallest districts was 10,973 persons and I call your attention to the fact that in Abate, Justice Marshall said that, and there the 11.9% was the total deviation which the Court upheld because of various factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4236.845" offset="17051752">Justice Marshall said, “And nothing we say today should be taken to imply that even these factors, those that were considered to uphold the 11.9% degree of deviation, justifies substantially greater deviations from population equality.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4253.270" offset="17117477">I might also note in passing that the 23.6 total deviation in the legislator's plan -- the legislature's plan is almost doubled at 10-15% variation between largest and smallest districts which Justice White said in his dissent in Kirkpatrick as a personal rule of thumb wouldn’t bother him too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="4272.961" offset="17196262">Our third point is that the justification which the State of Virginia Beach relies on, presents for these variations even though we say they can't be justified because they weren’t minor but the one the State relies on, the only one, simply doesn’t hold water, in that the State has not consistently applied a respect for the integrity of boundary lines in drawing its reapportionment plans and that includes the House of Delegates plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4300.371" offset="17305872">As Governor, Lieutenant Governor Howell pointed out our 1970 Constitution requires that every electoral district without any distinction between the House of Delegates districts, Senate districts or congressional districts comply with the population, equal population principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="4317.864" offset="17375880">Also all of the reapportionment, redistricting plans adopted by the Virginia General Assembly disregards subdivision lines in one degree or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="4327.638" offset="17414959">The congressional and Senate plans in many respects, the House of Delegates reapportionment plan in the case of one county.</text>
            <text syncTime="4335.257" offset="17445470">But beyond that, the House of Delegates plan has a board provision in it which opens the door to frequent violations of the integrity of subdivision lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="4345.881" offset="17487893">That is that Act says that the description of all legislative districts are final on the effective date of enactment, March 1, 1971, notwithstanding future boundary changes by annexation, merger, consolidation or the voiding of boundary changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4362.019" offset="17552468">Now, at the present time, half a dozen of cases pending in Virginia in the Federal or State courts in which are the counties are seeking to repeal annexation of part of their land for various reasons and having been annexed before March 01, 1971 by adjacent city, where cities are trying to bite off chunks in neighboring counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4385.300" offset="17645568">And any or all of these cases, the result could be a disregard of subdivision lines because if in effect a city where compelled to disgorge a part of a county, annexed prior to March 01, 1971, then of course, the line would pick up a part of the county, the existing legislative district.</text>
            <text syncTime="4404.741" offset="17723308">Or if a city prevails in annexing part of the county in the future, and there are three such cases now pending, then a legislated district would cut part of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="4414.643" offset="17763015">My fourth point is directed to appellant’s main thrust here that the Lower Court should not have formulated its own plan but rather should have sent the plan back to the General Assembly for action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4428.690" offset="17819126">Now, it’s obvious that in most cases, Court should leave reapportionment to the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="4433.743" offset="17839397">The point is that in this case, there is simply wasn’t time to do it or havoc would have been created with the elective processes of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="4442.562" offset="17874610">The primary election set by law for June 8 had already once been postponed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4448.289" offset="17897597">Candidates for the General Assembly running in those primaries were to file for revised districts within two weeks after the Court handed down its plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4458.090" offset="17936781">And it seems perfectly clear that the lower court could not as a practical matter, have given guidelines to The assembly, sent the matter back to the assembly, received back whatever plan they developed, reviewed it, modified it, held hearings, ordered in to effect without great disruption to Virginia’s elective procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="4478.592" offset="18018806">For example, it would have obviously compressed to the very end the filing dates for candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4483.872" offset="18039912">The primary would certainly – probably had to been postponed for the second time from September 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="4490.612" offset="18066871">Campaigns would have been compressed and perhaps the general election would have to been postponed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4495.516" offset="18086410">I submit to Your Honors that what the lower court did was entirely proper in accordance with the holding and opinion in Reynolds versus Sims where the Court stated that lower courts would have a wide latitude in developing “remedial techniques” and that these techniques “will probably often differed depending on local conditions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4517.791" offset="18175540">The Court there further stated and I think it’s particularly pertinent to this case that in a warning or withholding immediate relief the court is entitled to and should consider the proximity of a forthcoming election and the mechanics and complexities of State election laws and should act and rely up on general equitable principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4537.296" offset="18253594">Of course, as this Court has pointed out in Beans, the discretion of reapportioning court is not unlimited but it is certainly broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4546.554" offset="18290584">I can tell that the Court proceeded properly and in accordance with equitable principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4551.296" offset="18309601">First of all and most important to us it abolished the discrimination we complained of, and gave us the additional delegate we are entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4559.403" offset="18341992">Also acting reasonable, I believe, because it took the assembly’s House of Delegate plan and simply modified it as necessary to reduce the population deviations by about one half, the result being that the Court’s plan in Virginia, we have 134 counties and cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4579.336" offset="18421718">The courts plan found it necessary to cross boundary lines in the case of only 12 of these counties and cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4585.276" offset="18445542">So, I believe and submit to you that the Court’s plan was entirely reasonable and proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="4590.436" offset="18466126">And finally, Your Honors, as a practical matter, I submit that it’s unnecessary for the Supreme Court to further consider this case at this stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.222" offset="18509281">First of all, I want to remind you that the appeal here is from an interlocutory order below.</text>
            <text syncTime="4607.535" offset="18534567">Also, the Virginia General Assembly will meet next month at a regular session and under the clear holding in Connor versus Williams, it could have caused at that time enact or reenact any reapportionment legislation it saw fit, subject only of course to proper constitutional considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4628.128" offset="18616905">Now if it does so, at the coming General Assembly, that plan presumably would be referred back to the lower court for consideration and modification perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="4637.711" offset="18655253">If then, further appeals are taken to this Court, the situation deemed desirable by the Court in Connor versus Williams will then occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="4646.299" offset="18689630">The Court will then have it -- will then have which it does not now have a final order before it on appeal covering the entire State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4655.584" offset="18726724">As I say, it is only an interlocutory order that is before you now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4659.579" offset="18742711">Now, if on the other hand the General Assembly and it is much more likely fails to enact a new plan of reapportionment, its continued inaction will demonstrate very clearly, I submit to Your Honors, that the assembly now has no objection whatsoever to the District Court’s plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4678.289" offset="18817526">And this, as a matter of practicalities, I believe is the actual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4683.874" offset="18839886">Here are the facts; in 1971, the Attorney General of Virginia, my good friend Mr. Miller was asked to take this appeal by the 1971 assembly elected under the old law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4695.218" offset="18885235">Since then, a new General Assembly has been elected and is sitting and acting -- acted at the assembly session earlier this year and passed laws for the Government of Virginia.</text>

            <text syncTime="4732.741" offset="19035387">The clarification being that the last thing the House of Delegates, the present House of Delegates wants is a reversal of the reapportionment plan under which they were elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4742.540" offset="19074570">I submit to Your Honors, that under the circumstances here present where the legislative body elected and acting, under a District Court plan, a reversal of the lower court’s plan will be confusing to the voters, difficult for candidates and certainly not my judgment in the best interest the people of Virginia.</text>

            <text syncTime="4948.095" offset="19896801">Now, we have three senate districts here, five, six and seven which cover all of Norfolk and a portion of Virginia Beach.</text>

            <text syncTime="5113.213" offset="20557281">Well, he suggested that 9,500 lived out of the boundaries of the City of Norfolk, so as far -- the only portion of senate districts five, six and seven which the District Court consolidated, outside the City of Norfolk 40,000 out of a 170,000 total population of Virginia Beach.</text>
            <text syncTime="5129.231" offset="20621333">So I would readily concede Your Honor there maybe 1,000-2,000 of the 9,500 may live in the 40,000 which are part of Virginia Beach and then put in with Norfolk but clearly you are talking about a very significant number 40% on the basis of the zip codes at the minimum which live in other cities and outside the senatorial districts in question.</text>

            <text syncTime="5205.402" offset="20926025">We are talking about all members of the military.</text>

            <text syncTime="5263.924" offset="21160082">If the Court finds that there is any constitutional defect in the plan it adopted, it would be in a position to act in that session in accordance to whatever guidelines this Court lays down.</text>
            <text syncTime="5274.566" offset="21202610">However, I urge the Court to sustain the plan, as adopted by the General Assembly, as being fully in accord with the guidelines handed down by this Court in its decision in Reynolds versus Sims.</text>
