            <text syncTime="36.444" offset="249187">The Pittsburgh Press Company has, as most newspapers in the country did have, a system and still do, I might add, a system of classifying its 'Help Wanted' advertisements under either male or female.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.846" offset="330794">Some time after the passage of the Civil Rights Act and after EEOC guidelines which indicated that male and female as such might be proscribed and after the EEOC promulgated some alternative guidelines which have since been overturned again by the EEOC in one of their changes of guidelines, the Pittsburgh Press went to a system of male interest and female interest in a third column heading Male-Female.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.818" offset="478647">Appropriately and prominently displayed in the want-ads themselves at the heads of the columns were a rather large disclaimer box entitled "Notice to Job Seekers" which pointed out that the classification was for reader interest only, and should not be construed as being a limitation since most laws -- there were laws in most jurisdictions which proscribed discrimination on the basis --</text>

            <text syncTime="222.254" offset="992423">However, we do contend that the newspaper gets into the act by making an editorial decision that there are jobs, there is a large body of differing interest between males and females as they relate to the job market, and it is the decision of the newspaper to run column headings appealing to this reader interest and permitting advertisers to place job in there.</text>

            <text syncTime="319.441" offset="1381125">The first question is always, is it animal, vegetable, or mineral?</text>
            <text syncTime="322.218" offset="1392201">And this makes a gross categorization from which you take off, and we feel that the cultural patterns or biological, we wouldn't get into that debate I trust, for some reason men and women in this country prefer different types of jobs and it is a legitimate newspaper function to cater to these differences by putting the ads --  by providing different columns wherein advertisers can place these ads.</text>

            <text syncTime="368.722" offset="1578297">On the contrary, I think, when you take judicial notice in fact the average advertiser is merely seeking an employee and the idea of discrimination, one way or another doesn't come into his mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.788" offset="1622497">He is looking for an employee, if he advertises for a truck driver, the odds of him getting a female truck driver are relatively limited, no matter where he puts the ad.</text>

            <text syncTime="560.072" offset="2343685">Yes, it's part of our contention I would have it later in my argument, that a newspaper Mr. Justice Rehnquist, is a forum, a country market place if you will, a Roman Forum of the flow of information and ideas, and a very significant part of this is the Want ad columns.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.835" offset="2414738">They are used by the Department of Labor for example, as one of their indicators of economic health, the numbers of lines appearing in the accumulative Want ads throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.898" offset="2454967">They are an interchange of people who have the right to a job, seeking a job and people who wish to hire people, trying to find these people who are seeking jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.494" offset="2497390">It provides a very major community service.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.457" offset="2509197">Now I am not prepared to answer whether the company makes money on them or not, I suspect it does, they charge for want ads and they do make a lot of their revenue in their newspaper through advertising of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.195" offset="2560188">And I suspect it is profitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.449" offset="2569174">Now the Pittsburgh Press has a massive organization accepting, editing and setting up classified want ads, but it is and we are probably contending that it is a major community service and we further contend that's why we are here, that the complainants find this to be a major throat through which job applications flow, the job seekers seeking employers, and if they can control, they discriminate what they feel to be a discriminatory aspect of this at that throat, then they can take a big step forward in eliminating discrimination without the difficulty of proving any individual active discrimination or any individual intent to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.931" offset="2755062">They can get what they culturally seek which is broader job opportunities or broader job opportunities for women something which we do not necessarily disagree with editorially, but we feel that the place to battle is not in the want-ad pages of the newspaper particularly as it relates to the judgment of the newspapers as to how they are going to run those ads.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.156" offset="2852028">I hope that convoluted answer adequately addressed itself to your question Sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.660" offset="2882017">The Pittsburgh Press was after commission hearings eventually found to be violative of the Pittsburgh City ordinance in the way they place these ads, they were found specifically guilty of Section 8(J) which is aiding an employer in the act of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.561" offset="2953592">It is important to note that no -- in the findings of fact of the Commission, no act of discrimination on the part of any employer was found as a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.189" offset="2992149">There was minimal testimony presented at the hearing on the basis of one potential discriminatee but no proof was ever addressed that this particular job situation was covered by the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.113" offset="3039796">The ordinance has several exceptions, there can be a basic occupational qualification, a bona fide occupational qualification exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.724" offset="3070307">It applies to only employers of five and more and it is limited to the City of Pittsburgh itself, and does not apply to domestic help.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.126" offset="3107924">So there was no indication in the one bit of evidence presented that admit any of these tests and the Commission did not so find that it was discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.638" offset="3145958">When we appealed the case through Common Pleas and through the Commonwealth Court, we were arguing a) No discrimination was found; and b) It was a violation of the freedom of the press to impinge on its judgment of the newspapers to how it was going to arrange it's classified editorial pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.372" offset="3216906">In both cases we were, to finally use colloquial left off, simply saying that it is the law of the land that commercial advertising is not subject to First Amendment Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.893" offset="3270928">Now these, of course, are all contained in the opinions in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.439" offset="3285138">The case usually cited was Valentine versus Chrestensen and we are here today to ask this Court to extend its concepts of what constitutes First Amendment Rights in a commercial context.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.436" offset="3345115">As Mr. Justice Douglas said in the concurring opinion in Cammarano versus the United States in speaking of Valentine versus Chrestensen, the ruling was casual almost offhand and has not survived reflection.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.767" offset="3406451">He also said the press in its historic connotation comprehends every sort of publication which affords a vehicle of information and opinion, which is precisely what we are talking about in this free flow of information here.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.645" offset="3461935">And I think very well put was a comment in an Harvard Law Review article on deceptive advertising in 80 Harvard Law Review article where the commentator said “Yet no court talking about Valentine versus Chrestensen, yet no court has undertaken to explain why commercial advertising does not deserve a title speech which enables and protects social and religious advocacy and he went on to call it the stepchild of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.592" offset="3557752">Now, we hold that in the developing line of cases in this Court that the Valentine decision which was referred to in the Circuit Court in the Hunter case as being an unbroken line of authority for Valentine on.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.211" offset="3608221">On the contrary it maybe unbroken but it is a hazy and indistinct line at best and in my reading of the cases occasionally, if not broken, certainly it disappears like a road line on a snowy day, and we feel that the concepts developing in this Court as annunciated in New York Times versus Sullivan and in dissents in Breard versus Alexandria and in all of the newspaper cases from Grosjean on indicate that the Valentine case was simplistic, that the words and phrases of the Circuit Court would set absolute prohibition of expression in the marketplace as illegal and is not be saved by any commercial thing, if that's to the expression requires very serious redefinition by this Court and we are asking you to do so on a --</text>

            <text syncTime="1607.662" offset="6534040">We say too that in publications of limited interests such as sports magazine, the magazine MS, the black newspapers that we have in most of our urban centers, if they take an ad, it is, in essence, an expression of a preference for the limited readers, the limited group of readers that they represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.097" offset="6599764">And that if our newspaper can't take a job, put an ad under a female interest column, then it probably couldn't put it under a society page, and we seriously doubt if you extend that that putting it in a special interest publication, it constitutes expression of a preference, we wonder what will happen to the FCC regulations and Affirmative Action Programs that forces government contractors to apply or to advertise for jobs in black newspapers, the Spanish speaking newspapers in appropriate areas and others, because those are definitely an expression of a preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.742" offset="6750333">And are those newspapers to be placed on their peril to be sure that the advertiser also advertises some place else to get a wide range or body of response to the ad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.446" offset="6797145">Judge Crumlish of Commonwealth Court addressed himself to that very point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.699" offset="6814177">He mentioned I believe Ms. Magazine and Ebony when he discussed, are we to really get in censor by making them aiders, which is what we were accused of and found guilty of here being an aider in discrimination, merely because the Ku Klux Klan Journal runs a -- if they have such a thing, runs a want-ad section and I think that we can take judicial notice of the fact that if an employer placed the want-ad or an employee in Ku Klux Klan Journal, he is not likely to get too many employees who were not White Anglo-Saxon Protestants, and probably Southern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.608" offset="6953775">I think we find that the newspapers are being impinged on with some significant degree and as one court said this maybe an idea whose time has come but we ask that it should be let come through the free interchange of ideas and through the interchange of advertisers and readers and through cultural change, if it will, but it not come through government fiat and the cultural predilections of local special interest groups or government officials.</text>

            <text syncTime="1747.794" offset="7094523">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.011" offset="7107375">I represent the City of Pittsburgh and it's Human Relations Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.894" offset="7126915">The Commission like the EEOC and similar commissions in other states, many of which are represented by amicus briefs here today was created in an attempt to eliminate discrimination including employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.686" offset="7186160">A 1969 Amendment to the Human Relation Ordinance of the City of Pittsburgh, added a prohibition on the basis of sex to the other prohibitions on race, religion, national origin grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.746" offset="7246346">The relevant section of the ordinance for our purposes is Section 8, Section 8 (e) makes it an unlawful employment practice to publish or cause to be published an advertisement indication any discrimination on the basis of sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.962" offset="7319176">Section 8 (j) prohibits any person, which is defined so as to include a newspaper from aiding or participating in the doing of an unlawful employment practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.951" offset="7367137">The National Organization for Women filed a complaint alleging that the Press had violated Section 8(j) in permitting advertisers to advertise in these sex segregated columns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.471" offset="7425233">The Commission, after a hearing and then the Common Pleas Court and the Commonwealth Courts of Pennsylvania held that there were violations of the ordinance and that no constitutional rights of petitioner had been abridged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.128" offset="7483852">There are two constitutional questions raised here: First Amendment question, which I will deal with and the due process question, which counsel for the National Organization for Women will discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.367" offset="7536828">Respondents believe that there is no First Amendment violation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.356" offset="7560756">This Court has continually held that constitutionally protected speech is less than absolute and the courts have pointed out several ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.259" offset="7600358">Justice Harlan in the Konigsberg case mentioned two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.335" offset="7616763">First, he said that speech in certain context do not have First Amendment protection, and secondly he said that general regulatory statutes not intended to control the content of speech, but incidentally, limiting its unfettered exercise were permissible so long as the laws were justified by an important governmental interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.209" offset="7712162">I think that to these two limitations we can add a third, which may just be a subcategory of the second and that is that conduct, even where there are some idea associated with it, does not have the First Amendment protection that pure speech has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.664" offset="7782066">The petitioners' activity in this case we believe fails to qualify for First Amendment protection on not just one of these basis, but on all three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.084" offset="7823757">First of all it's commercial speech and this is one of the context where this Court has held that the First Amendment does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.241" offset="7864299">Began in the unanimous decision of this Court in Valentine against Chrestensen in 316 U.S., where the Court said that while freedom of communicating information of course enjoys a high degree of protection, the constitution imposes no such restrain on government as respects purely commercial advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.778" offset="7950503">We believe that Valentine is good law today; it's been cited with approval by this Court in many cases which we point in our brief, and it's been cited with approval in New York Times against Sullivan, which we find very surprising that the petitioner relies on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.790" offset="8026572">That was a political advertisement in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.971" offset="8039215">It recited grievances, it protested claimed abuses, it expressed opinion and the Court was very careful to distinguish that political advertisement from the commercial advertisement in Valentine against Chrestensen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.172" offset="8104103">And I think that New York Times, the political advertisement there, can be distinguished from the advertisements involved in this case on the same basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.838" offset="8154676">This non-protection of commercial speech, we believe, makes a great deal of sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.506" offset="8181426">Professor Emerson has rationalized it as applying -- commercial speech applying to a separate sector of economic activity, an area that involves economic interest rather than the interest of free expression, the production of goods and services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.131" offset="8263868">The terms that this Court used in Chaplinsky against New Hampshire, we are not dealing with any essential part of exposition of ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.873" offset="8306813">I, again, find it surprising that petitioner would rely on the Meiklejohn view of First Amendment applying to governing speech, because we feel that that's a situation where, his theory says that Public affairs, speech that has to do with public affairs, is protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.234" offset="8392286">And I think that this Court indicated in New York Times that it was endorsing the Meiklejohn theory when it distinguished between public liable and private liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.748" offset="8442337">It would seem to me fairly obvious that this case falls on the private side of the public-private dichotomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.431" offset="8477132">The petitioner's answer to this as well the advertisements themselves may not be ideas, but the column headings are ideas, they are different; they are --</text>

            <text syncTime="2118.253" offset="8576397">Before the luncheon break, I was indicating that these commercial advertisements are non-ideas and the petitioners' response to this is to say that the ads themselves may not be ideas, but that the column headings are different, that they are abbreviated editorial comment that certain jobs are of more interest to men than to women.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.642" offset="8681932">However, this argument corresponds neither to the facts, nor the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.205" offset="8704188">In answer to the question that Justice White asked, the paper does not give the slightest thought to whether the advertised job interest men or women; it goes wherever the advertiser wants the ad to go, regardless of whether the newspaper might have thought that this is a female type job or a male type job.</text>

            <text syncTime="3138.960" offset="12659231">Thank You Chief Justice Burger, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.149" offset="12675950">I am representing in this proceeding, The National Organization for Women.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.279" offset="12708446">The National Organization for Women, as I am sure you must have heard and read in the newspapers with no hierarchy, is an organization, which is committed to the advancement of the rights of women to the elimination of discrimination based upon sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.711" offset="12786186">It has been in existence for a number of years and in this case, the original complaint was filed by a male member of NOW Gerald Gardner, the treasurer of the organization and an active member in the group.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.299" offset="12852537">The organization participated in offering testimony at the Commission and was instrumental in bringing in the Federal officials who testify in support of the policy which was adapted by the city ordinance and which was being, we contended, violated in terms of the want-ad classifications used in the Pittsburgh Press and the only other metropolitan newspaper the Post-Gazette.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.344" offset="12980746">The Commission found in our favor and made specific findings of fact, which were then affirmed by the higher state court to review this, the Commonwealth Court, should be fairly conclusive of the issues involved here, particularly in terms of the limitations which this Court has observed in recent years, as to the review of substantive due process questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.886" offset="13122957">Now, of course, the real thrust of this case is the attempt by women to abolish a very important, albeit it may seem subtle, attempt to keep women in the place that they have traditionally been.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.157" offset="13195995">And in fact, the argument for petitioner suggest this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.853" offset="13214804">They talk about women being secretaries and apparently this is the basis for their whole classification system, that is that there are certain kinds of jobs which women have had traditionally and therefore they should ought to go on having in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.075" offset="13287633">Now this is the kind of thing that is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.053" offset="13303620">The failing on the part of no doubt, some of the employers who advertise in the paper and certainly by their own admission on the part of the newspaper that women should be kept in their place and this is the issue involved here as to whether they may, in fact, to do that in view of the Equal Protection Clause, the Due Process Clause, the other aspects of the Federal Constitution which have served to bring Black people out of bondage, and which now we are calling upon to serve as a way of meeting the economic problems of women.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.286" offset="13476551">At the hearings before the Commission, and we have given you some statistics in our brief as well and other of the amicus briefs contain economic data here, which is of great significance in this case, because it does establish that women have been discriminated against job wise; that they have been deterred from applying for jobs, because they believe that they were not welcomed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.207" offset="13596191">And at this point in the process, the deterrence from even applying for a job, that the Pittsburgh Press comes into the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.241" offset="13636315">These classification had -- as you now are very well aware, were set up by the press, but the place where the ad is to go, whether it is to go under female interest or male interest is determined, according to the testimony of the press employees who appeared, as being the decision of the employer himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.329" offset="13752717">Now the covered employer, who comes to advertise and who wants to discriminate against women, but knows that it's against the law and that he can't put in an ad saying Males Only or can't put it under a Males Only heading, can turn from this euphemism which is now being used by the paper; the same headings that were used before -- the headings that were used before were male jobs, female jobs, help wanted for a male or female.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.223" offset="13892315">Now they have changed that only slightly, only to say male interest, female interest, so that the same stress will look under female interest jobs and the tailor, who makes much more will look under the male interest jobs and this is such a --</text>

            <text syncTime="3469.497" offset="13981341">Why wouldn't it be enough for the State to move against the employer and forbid the employer from indicating to the paper any preference whatsoever unless he had a certificate?</text>

            <text syncTime="3553.186" offset="14316126">It's a way -- well, there are two but they are published together, so it's the same difference, but what we are trying to do is to get at the advertising, which is the thing, which -- the advertising headings, which are the message which is being conveyed to women that they should stay away from applying for a particular job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.063" offset="14419675">And as the Solicitor General said in the amicus brief that was filed in this case, the only message meaningfully communicated by the headings is that employers advertising thereunder will discriminate and they will hire, and that thus it does serve as  a deterrence you see to women applying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.964" offset="14515179">It's not anything that is said in the ad itself, rather it is the headings under which the ads appear, which deters women from applying jobs, for jobs for which they may very well be qualified.</text>

            <text syncTime="3638.200" offset="14656136">It seems to me that you would have to enjoin the individual employment agency or employer from advertising under a Male Help Wanted column or a Female as the case maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.479" offset="14709321">And in that case, I suppose that those employers could resort to the male, female heading which is available, and which is practically not used at all, in terms of the column inches of spaces, only a 100 and in an average issue of Sunday paper, as compared with 1600 column inches of male ads and 400 for female ads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.435" offset="14817155">So, that you would have immensely difficult problem of reaching each of the employers, and it is a job which really is not forced upon us when we have the ordinance which says that, anyone who aids in discrimination, and we say that these headings are an aid, can be reached directly, and this is what we are trying to do in this case Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3724.177" offset="15000116">When he pointed out that the press is not called to do any screening; this is an error which was picked up by the Appellate Division Courts of New York in National Organization for Women versus the States Division of Human Right, which was just reported in the CCH Employment Practices Decisions service, wherein they distinguished the Pittsburgh Press case in one of their own where they did not permit a court to bar the the -- that was a rule in our way in this particular given fact situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.049" offset="15131564">They permitted the sex segregated want-ads to continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.924" offset="15147029">They distinguished the Pittsburgh Press case in that the Pittsburgh Press had a ready screening device with this certificate, but that only applies to the one exemption; the bona fide occupational qualification exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.173" offset="15204080">The Ordinance also excludes domestics and it excludes people who do not live in the City of Pittsburgh by Commonwealth Court order and it excludes employers of less than five, so that the Press would still have thrust upon it the burden of screening out these other criteria.</text>

            <text syncTime="3847.103" offset="15491741">Actually this is not the case, the Pittsburgh Press is not attempting to keep women in its place, whatever that maybe and I think that's a ratio up that's calculated to cause certain emotional reactions in the justices.</text>
