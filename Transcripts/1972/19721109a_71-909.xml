            <text syncTime="38.977" offset="259323">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.073" offset="275623">This Freedom of Information Act suit was brought by respondents to compel the release of documents prepared for the President relating to the then proposed and now completed underground nuclear test at Amchitka Island, Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.580" offset="341661">It presents fundamental questions concerning the scope and application of exemptions one and five of the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.657" offset="381994">Whether documents prepared to advise the President with respect to underground nuclear test, many of them containing Top Secret and Secret information are exempt from compulsory disclosure under the Act and whether a District Court should be required to make an In Camera Inspection of the documents in order to determine whether portions are non-secret or factual in character.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.955" offset="491186">The facts maybe quickly summarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.377" offset="500903">On July 28, 1971 Congresswoman Mink asked President Nixon to release reports prepared for him relating to the proposed Amchitka test.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.284" offset="548551">The President declined to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.491" offset="557328">His counsel replying on July 30 that “these recommendations were prepared for the advise of the President and involve highly sensitive matters that are vital to our national defense and foreign policy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="127.813" offset="614588">Several weeks later, respondents instituted this action pursuant to the Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.749" offset="638412">A separate litigation committee for a Nuclear Responsibility versus Seaborg the so called CNR case was brought by an environmental group to enjoin the test itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.802" offset="690552">This Court denied an application for an injunction in that case on November 6, 1971, a little more than year ago and the Amchitka test was conducted successfully later that same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.989" offset="743320">A partial or total declassification and public release of declassified parts of three documents involved in this case occurred in connection with the CNR litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.570" offset="801625">Respondents continue to seek the undisclosed material, including three classified documents not involved in anyway in the CNR case.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.765" offset="846451">The District Court in this case without In Camera Inspection granted the government’s motion for summary judgment holding that the document fell within exemptions one and five of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.101" offset="895770">The district court relied on an affidavit of Under Secretary of State Irwin, who is Chairman of the National Security Council Committee which prepared the report for the President on the Amchitka blast.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.167" offset="948015">The nine documents sought by respondents are described in some detail in the Irwin affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.459" offset="977168">Three including the report of the Irwin committee itself and a Top Secret report from Dr. Kissinger are classified as Top Secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.090" offset="1015724">Three others are classified as Secret including reports from the AEC and the Office of Science and Technology and all nine documents as the Irwin affidavit stated “were prepared and used solely for transmittal to the President as advice and recommendations and set forth the views and opinions of the individuals and agencies preparing the documents so that the President might be fully apprised of varying viewpoints.”</text>
            <text syncTime="258.969" offset="1139231">The Court of Appeals reversed and remained the case to the District Court for In Camera Inspection of the documents and a determination whether disclosure should be ordered as the sum of the materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.126" offset="1187924">It ruled that document classified as Top Secret and Secret pursuant to Executive Order 10501 should be reviewed by the District Court to permit disclosure of any “non-secret components which are separable from the secret remainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.328" offset="1260648">With respect to the governments claim under exemption five that the nine documents were internal memoranda containing policy advice” the Court held that the document should be reviewed in camera to permit disclosure and “a factual information unless it is inextricably intertwined with policy making processes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="313.917" offset="1359078">In both respects I submit the Court below was grievously in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.296" offset="1384573">The starting point is the language of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.489" offset="1401292">Exemption one excludes from the Act disclosure requirements “matters specifically required by Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of the national defense or foreign policy,” matters specifically required by Executive Order to be kept secret.”</text>
            <text syncTime="343.655" offset="1477987">The legislative history makes it clear that this language means what it says that the exemption protects from disclosure governmental records such as six of the nine documents sought here which have been classified as Top Secret or Secret pursuant to the authority granted by Executive Order 10501.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.191" offset="1568162">Respondent’s argument that the President must individually classify each document by a separate Executive order is preposterous on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.054" offset="1615600">When Congress enacted the Freedom of Information Act in 1966, it legislated against the backdrop of many years of operation of the classification system.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.769" offset="1662412">Executive Order 10501 which has provided the basis for classification of the defense information since 1953, was repeatedly referred to, during congressional consideration of exemption one and clearly it is an Executive Order which “specifically requires certain matters specified therein to be kept secret.”</text>
            <text syncTime="416.784" offset="1770559">When a document is properly classified pursuant to the applicable Executive Order, the government is not required to review the document paragraph by paragraph to determine whether portions of it are non-secret and maybe disclose.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.831" offset="1834715">Executive Order 10501 which is reprinted in the appendix to our brief, treats the document as the appropriate unit for classification purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1953.673" offset="7918111">I think in fairness to the court below, I should point to a few facts that primarily showed there was an urgency at the time of considerations below that do not obtain now and then explain the posture of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.071" offset="7995643">I say that particularly in connection with the last question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.721" offset="8010271">Actually, the Court of Appeals begun its opinion, in its opinion with the observation that it didn't answer all the questions before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.610" offset="8045798">It was dealing with a motion for summary reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.831" offset="8062725">The case in a sense began with a newspaper article.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.321" offset="8092609">I think it is very important to the court to consider it in the light of the New York Times case, because it is closely related.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.300" offset="8124583">You may recall the Solicitor General in the New York Times argument referring to the fact that there could have been a case under the Freedom of Information Act to have obtained those documents and in a sense this case may tell us whether the Elseberg way, so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.384" offset="8192920">Is the only way available or there is a judicial sanction that can be used to cause a disclosure of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.055" offset="8223640">On July 26, 1971 there was an article in the Washington Star that said that two agencies, the Department of Defense and the Atomic Energy Commission them were urging the going forward with this Cannikin Amchitka megaton detonation which was then scheduled for October that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.376" offset="8308903">It will on to say that there was a controversy within the government that five agencies were opposing the test and described them as being the process state United States Information Agency, The office of Science and Technology, the Council on Environmental Quality and The Environmental Protection Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.871" offset="8382882">Then as you can from the record it alluded briefly to the reasons now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.449" offset="8401168">Now when that came forth congressmen who were particularly concerned about the test and primarily people from Hawaii and California, because there had been earthquakes from seismic action in the allusion chain that had caused deaths and great damage in Hawaii and in California, immediately sought to determine what the nature of these reports was, what facts they were within these reports, because as Congress women and men they had two actions coming up before them in the immediate future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.029" offset="8539512">The Authorization Act for the Atomic Energy Commission was before them in July that year and in August and the Appropriations Act for that agency and for this very test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.666" offset="8590085">Now it was in that urgent context that this went before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.274" offset="8604505">The suit was filed on August 11th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.076" offset="8611715">It was disposed off by partial dismissal and partial summary judgment for the government on August 27th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.673" offset="8646092">The Court of Appeals expedited as did the court below in accordance with the mandate of the Act itself and the situation as well and heard arguments in the late September, mid the late September and decided the case on October 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.418" offset="8725086">Now, as I said at the beginning it began, it's summarily reversed, but it began with the observation that after considering the arguments of counsel and these covered the entire range of the complaint and the responses in the motions for summary judgment that both the parties had filed, that this case was inappropriate for summary disposition and that it was not going to summarily dispose of the case, but it wanted in a practical way to give some guidance to the District Courts so there could be some expedition and review this information to see if it could be submitted to the Congress before the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.725" offset="8886314">And it is in that way that the case went back down and there were only two areas in which the Court of Appeals summarily disposed of the issues before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.677" offset="8938036">First, it said that classification by association is erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.163" offset="8956008">Now all it had before it was the Irwin affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.746" offset="8974399">All it knew about the documents was what was said in the Irwin affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.006" offset="8995401">When you look at the Irwin affidavit, you'll see that one document, the impact statement so called was as a matter of law publicly, the Congress required that it be published; that each of the other line was restricted as Secret, Top Secret or under the Atomic Energy Commission as restricted data.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.482" offset="9077321">Now when you see what happened in a parallel case with these very documents, it is now argued we should not be able to see at all. You'll find that they have been reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.920" offset="9131029">Three were partially disclosed in a collateral case of these very documents that the government is now arguing we shouldn't be able to see, were disclosed to the plaintiff in the environmental case, the nuclear responsibility case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.146" offset="9184005">Six were permitted, as I say permitted in the sense that the government conceded that the District Court could review them, here it’s in camera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.823" offset="9222666">Here it says that shouldn't happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.215" offset="9232280">August 6th, that were reviewed in the camera, in camera the six of these ten.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.657" offset="9250043">Five were specified in the Irwin affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.762" offset="9266448">It didn't say they are partially classified, they are Top Secret; it said they are classified Top Secret or Secret as the case may be, yet these were reviewed, five of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.466" offset="9305213">Two were internally insofar as the record in that case, which is before the Court shows, were entirely classified Secret or Top Secret and they were reviewed by the Court below, the very thing that is not permitted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.110" offset="9371773">Now all the Court of Appeals said was “if there is matter within these documents that can be separated without distorting its meaning, if it is not so inextricably interwoven, the phrase below, that it can be separated, do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.019" offset="9451499">That's what it directed summarily by summary disposition, the District Court to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.860" offset="9474800">And it said that if it is necessary, then you should review in camera to determine that these two issues, whether or not, they are documents attached to other documents and classified as was the case in fact, although the Irwin affidavit did not so and classified merely by association and the Court of Appeals says it never had that concession before it, that has been made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.742" offset="9574379">The concession was made in footnote 4 of the petition for the writ of certiorari here, that the mere attachment of an unclassified document to a classified document, even though specified in 10501 Executive Order to permeate to the document so attached with the highest classification for purposes of the Freedom of Information Act, does not become so classified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.695" offset="9678137">And then the other part is whether there are components within a single document, that would not be classified and that is all that the Court of Appeals has done and it has asked the Court below to look at these in camera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.019" offset="9723486">Now I think --</text>

            <text syncTime="2405.493" offset="9725367">I thought it was considered, the Court of Appeals might have done and goes certainly considerably beyond the language of the exemption and be one it is not, which would seem, at least on the face of the literal words that the Court should limit its inquiry to determining whether these matters were specifically required by Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of the National defense or foreign policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.343" offset="9824737">Will that be?</text>

            <text syncTime="2437.366" offset="9852844">Well, I think the key to it though is the Court of Appeals’ opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.243" offset="9868309">It expressly says that it is not going to resolve by summary disposition, the test to be applied under exemption number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.560" offset="9905612">We had urged to the District Court that the test be the test that President Eisenhower and and President Kennedy and President Johnson and President Nixon had all prescribed for executive privilege when pled before the Congress and that is that the President caused an independent review of each document and each part of each document is to which the privilege was to be extended, be made and then it would be classified on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.486" offset="10009266">The government roughly below said -- that there is no power in the Court to review it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.230" offset="10028283">We say it is classified, that's it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3486.037" offset="14047483">It's the only meaning that I can read out of it, I think in connection with Justice Blackmun's question that there are two steps to number one but I don't think those were steps were considered or adjudicated by the Court below or should be by this Court, but I think first, it determines whether it was specifically required and second, whether it was clearly erroneous, at least that would be the standard that I proposed but the Court of Appeals didn't feel it necessary and I think wisely so to determine that test at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3553.390" offset="14316962">Well I think the analogy here would be, if the executive came in and said here is the statute Your Honor and cites the statute, therefore you can’t look at this matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="3571.533" offset="14389478">Then I think the judge would have to look and see whether there is anything in the file or the military records or medical records from military hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.953" offset="14419153">I don't think that in our advisory system or particularly in a place of critical checks and balances that we have here because obviously if you can put a stamp on these things and preclude judicial review, the Act has no value in terms of checks and balances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.964" offset="14483205">I think that the Court would have to look at that file and determine in its work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.554" offset="14501595">But it's the function that is imposed upon the judiciary by this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.192" offset="14532106">So we would urge affirmance.</text>
