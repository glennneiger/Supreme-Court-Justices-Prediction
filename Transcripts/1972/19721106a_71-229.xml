            <label>Mr. Philip A. Lacovara</label>
            <text syncTime="19.486" offset="181269">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.714" offset="194226">This case, United States against Dionisio and the next case on the Court's calendar this morning, United States against Mara, both raised important questions about the ability of federal grand juries to obtain exemplar evidence from recalcitrant witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.395" offset="264965">Both cases are here on writs of certiorari applied for by the United States to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.170" offset="300074">In this case, the proceedings began when a special federal grand jury sitting in the Northern District of Illinois, the special February 1971 grand jury, subpoenaed Mr. Dionisio and approximately 20 others in a gambling investigation that the special grand jury was conducting.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.541" offset="385546">Mr. Dionisio and others were ordered by the grand jury foreman to give voice exemplars and this was explained to them to be the reading of a transcript over a telephone connected to a recording device.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.150" offset="452002">Mr. Dionisio refused to give the exemplars as directed by the grand jury foreman and as did other grand jury witnesses and the government, thereafter filed petitions to obtain court orders to compel the furnishing of the voice exemplars.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.395" offset="524936">The government’s petition against Mr. Dionisio alleged that the special grand jury was investigating violations of federal criminal statutes that the grand jury thought it necessary and essential to obtain a voice exemplar of Mr. Dionisio’s voice on the telephone for the sole purpose of comparing his voice as recorded with voices intercepted pursuant to court orders issued by the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.121" offset="651891">The government also alleged that the transcript that Mr. Dionisio had been asked to read was special grand jury Exhibit 13, which the petition stated consisted of names, numbers and races, names of horses, numbers of horses and races and certain other information.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.863" offset="746872">A hearing on petition in this matter, as well as the petitions with respect to the other 20 or so recalcitrant witnesses was held before Chief Judge Robson of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.661" offset="793997">And at that hearing, it was brought out that what the government was seeking was compliance with what was termed a reasonable order of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.902" offset="834957">And this was explained to mean that if an exemplar that was clear was given only one exemplar would be necessary that on the basis of similar requests, several days earlier, exemplars had been given by other witnesses and the time consumed had been no more than 10 or 20 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.060" offset="919594">That the government would preserve any and all original exemplars for subsequent comparison and expert analysis including by the defense and that counsel could be present during the taking of the exemplars, because the expected procedure would be that the exemplar would be given before a specially designated agent of the grand jury outside the grand jury room.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.968" offset="1039235">Chief Judge Robson entered orders directing each of the witnesses including Mr. Dionisio to provide the exemplars.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.804" offset="1074552">19 of the 21 witnesses did provide the exemplars under court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.689" offset="1094092">Mr. Dionisio and one other witness whose petition was ultimately dismissed by the government refused to give the exemplars asserting Fourth and Fifth Amendment defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.857" offset="1146755">The Court entered an opinion, which is reprinted in the Appendix to our certiorari petition in which both the Fourth Amendment and Fifth Amendment claims were rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.456" offset="1193148">On the Fourth Amendment issue, Chief Judge Robson held that since the grand jury subpoenas were lawful, the witnesses were properly subject to these directions, were not in unlawful detention within the meaning of this Court’s decision in Davis against Mississippi and relying on this Court's decisions in Gilbert, Wade and other cases held that no Fifth Amendment values are impinged upon by requiring a person to give exemplars.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.856" offset="1318745">When Mr. Dionisio refused an open court to give the exemplars, he was committed for contempt until he complied with the order or until the expiration of 18 months which is the maximum statutory imprisonment for civil contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.328" offset="1392724">On appeal, after Mr. Dionisio had been released on bond by the Seventh Circuit, the Court Of Appeals rejected Fifth Amendment claims, as well as any possible Sixth Amendment claim, but found that the Fourth Amendment defense was a valid one.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.406" offset="1469001">The Court ruled that before a grand jury may compel a witness before it to give exemplars of his voice, the government must make an affirmative factual showing that this request is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.740" offset="1530337">The Court apparently believed that the petition and the hearing that were -- was held on the government’s petition did not satisfy that reasonable -- reasonableness of request and the Court reversed the contempt judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.394" offset="1588955">The ground for decision by the Seventh Circuit was essentially that exemplars maybe covered by the Fourth Amendment relying here on the same case that the District Court had found not applicable, Davis against Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.345" offset="1652799">And also that the Fourth Amendment applies to grand jury proceedings and the Court relied on one or two decisions of this Court in which the Court stated that grand jury subpoenas for the production of documents might be so broad and ill-defined as to constitute an unreasonable search.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.246" offset="1740361">The government petition for rehearing en banc that was denied by a 5:3 vote and in August of 1971 we filed the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.117" offset="1783829">In May of 1972, after we filed a supplemental memorandum calling to the Court’s attention in intervening decision by Chief Judge Friendly of the Second Circuit, which had explicitly rejected the rationale of the Dionisio case, Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.369" offset="1856867">The issue then in this first case is whether, when a grand jury witness has been properly called before an investigating grand jury, the Fourth Amendment requires that before a witness can be compelled to give exemplars of his voice, or as in Mara exemplars of his handwriting, the government must make an affirmative factual showing that this request is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.715" offset="1982255">It’s the government’s petition -- position that no such requirement of affirmative factual showing of reasonableness is necessary under the Fourth Amendment and that the decision below constitutes a departure from settled principles of grand jury practice and settled principles of the application of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.776" offset="2082461">We think the appropriate place to start in this case, as Chief Judge Friendly in the Schwartz case has done, is with the nature of the grand jury itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.913" offset="2123003">There is no need, I think, for us to rehearse at any great length the principles governing grand jury investigations, since only last term the Court had a number of such cases before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.448" offset="2169187">But briefly the relevant context here is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.253" offset="2188413">A grand jury is the touchstone of the criminal process under the Federal System since only a grand jury can initiate felony prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.770" offset="2230418">The grand jury for several hundred years has had the undisputed right to compulsory process.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.266" offset="2256436">This Court has explained that compulsory process involves not only the justifiable demand that every witness appear before the grand jury, but that every witness unless his testimony is privileged must testify before the grand jury in its search for truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.936" offset="2335117">The last term in a decision which has been rendered by this Court since the Seventh Circuit’s decision in the two cases before the Court this morning, the Court rejected the very kind of preliminary showing that the Seventh Circuit has imposed in these cases in Branzburg, Caldwell, and Pappas, will be recalled where important First Amendment rights were unquestionably involved as none of the justices of the Court disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.100" offset="2451728">The Court nevertheless said that in light of the historic function of the grand jury even where it was possible that there might be some collateral impact on First Amendment values.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.018" offset="2503450">Nevertheless, a newsman subpoenaed before a grand jury had an obligation to appear and had an obligation to testify and in rendering that decision the Court explicitly rejected the suggestion that even in order to protect these First Amendment rights some preliminary showing should be made before the newsman was compelled to respond to the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.317" offset="2608671">The showing that was suggested by the lower courts by the dissent in Branzburg was remarkably similar to the showing of reasonableness that the Seventh Circuit has imposed in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.297" offset="2664573">And it’s our position that a showing, in this context, is no more justified than in the Branzburg, Caldwell, and Pappas context.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="650.634" offset="2705951">But that’s a -- if there's no invasion of either the Fourth and Fifth Amendment, you don’t even get to this question of what kind of a proceeding is involved here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_a_lacovara" startTime="659.901" stopTime="731.028">
            <label>Mr. Philip A. Lacovara</label>
            <text syncTime="659.901" offset="2742941">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.492" offset="2745344">The second case this morning involves the follow up decision by the Seventh Circuit of the -- nature of the proceeding that must be held to demonstrate reasonableness and the substantive content of the reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.756" offset="2794350">But if this Court decides that the Seventh Circuit erred in Dionisio in saying that there is this kind of constitutional requirement, the second case, in our judgment, becomes academic.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.024" offset="2855476">The contention by the Seventh Circuit which is, of course, defended by the respondents in these cases is that compelling a witness to provide this kind of exemplar evidence is covered by the Fourth Amendment, even though, as the Seventh Circuit itself is conceded, the Fourth Amendment, governing unreasonable seizures of persons, does not apply to summoning a witness before a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.249" offset="2956413">It has never been held and no court that I am aware of has ever suggested that a general -- as a general principle, the Government or the grand jury must make a preliminary showing of reasonableness before a witness can be compelled to appear and testify before a grand jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1063.387" offset="4356890">On this point, I reiterate that the order that was entered by Chief Judge Robson and the order that was asked for by the government provide it with a giving of exemplars either before and to the grand jury or to a specially designated agent of the grand jury who had been sworn by the grand jury previously to receive this evidence so that, as I say, there was also no objection on the ground that this was beyond the power of the grand jury to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.710" offset="4478203">And we suggest the case of Bryan against the United States in 339 U.S. is dispositive of this point, since this objection was not made by the witnesses, it was not the basis for his objection and if that objection had been made, the government of course would have been quite willing to receive the exemplars in the grand jury room.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.851" offset="4558764">But as the transcript of the hearing makes it clear, Mr. Justice Marshall, the government counsel said that the procedure that was contemplated was outside the grand jury room so that respondent’s counsel could be present at the taking of these exemplars.</text>

            <text syncTime="1405.171" offset="5724035">This is also evidence that he has with him at that time, its evidence about his own physical characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.502" offset="5749426">Now, Chief Judge Friendly in the Schwartz case, which rejects the rationale of the Seventh Circuit here, says that, “This doesn’t implicate any Fourth Amendment rights at all, because these identifying physical characteristics, voice, or in Mara, handwriting are not characteristics as to which any person has a reasonable expectation of privacy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.702" offset="5842213">And for this reason -- in Judge Friendly’s analysis were not even talking about a search or a seizure within Fourth Amendment terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.591" offset="5877739">This is simply the requirement of giving of testimony or evidence which is no different from the formulation of oral responses by a grand jury witness lawfully before the grand jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1476.368" offset="6008874">And I think that that brings us right to Davis against Mississippi, which is perhaps the heart of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.641" offset="6033951">The Seventh Circuit, I think, misunderstood that and I’m happy to be able to rely on Judge -- Chief Judge Friendly as having correctly, in our view, understood Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.178" offset="6072090">In Davis, the Court’s analysis was not whether fingerprints, abstractly considered are protected by the Fourth Amendment whether it’s a right to privacy in a man’s fingerprints.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.733" offset="6122350">The analysis there was, as the Court formulated the question, can fingerprints, taken in the course of unlawful police detention, be used against the 14-year old black to convict him with rape?</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.724" offset="6170311">We don’t have that problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.634" offset="6177938">The witness was lawfully before the grand jury. Chief Judge Robson recognized that that was the determinative factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.174" offset="6204061">Chief Judge Friendly has said the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.255" offset="6212420">And I think the court’s own an explanation in Davis that there is no prying into private thoughts or personal information when fingerprints are obtained, supports Judge Friendly’s analysis that this really isn’t a search or seizure problem, assuming that the police -- that the government citizen contact itself is lawful, as we submit it is under the Fourth Amendment when a grand jury process is being used not a street confrontation during the police investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2265.903" offset="9166973">And that the grand jury would be violating the individual Fourth Amendment rights just as much as the unlawful police detention in which the fingerprinting was a product of that unlawful detention because it is true that the grand jury can issue a subpoena to compel the appearance of anyone before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.964" offset="9283271">However, the grand jury cannot issue a subpoena to compel the production of things before it without regard to the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.741" offset="9338337">And I think by analogy, proposed Rule 41, new federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that applications can be made to magistrates to compel individuals to submit to identification procedures such as suggested here, such as voiceprints, fingerprints, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.822" offset="9430706">However, in applying to a magistrate for such an order, the agency or the government applying to the magistrate must submit papers to show probable cause and reasonable grounds before the magistrate will issue such an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.851" offset="9518791">Now, grand juries, I think are subject generally to the jurisdiction of the District Courts and to say that the grand jury then would have greater subpoena power than the District Court, I think is to ignore the function of the grand jury we can compel for example the attendance of witnesses before any District Court in the United States by proper service of the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.718" offset="9642193">But we could not compel that person in a -- to compel him to appear before the District Court in a case on trial, and I don’t think then could compel him to give voice identification, handwriting exemplars or whatever other physical characteristic be required.</text>

            <text syncTime="2785.487" offset="11245275">But then to allow the grand jury to turn around and do the exactly the same thing, we submit is just as much protected by the Fourth Amendment as it would be protected in an application to a magistrate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3286.272" offset="13248449">But for the only, the only way that any comparison can be made is if one speaks into a specific type of device which records the vibrations and the tonal effects of the voice and that they can then be compared to other unknown samples.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.678" offset="13318040">But the mere talking before the grand jury would not allow the grand jury as I understand the procedure in voice exemplars to make a comparison to a unknown sample.</text>

            <text syncTime="3330.494" offset="13425351">Yes two points Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.298" offset="13440606">First of all on the question of what the government’s contentions are in this case, I should point out that we are not here pressing the notion that nothing that a grand jury might demand would be covered by the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.368" offset="13496822">We do not have a case where the grand jury was demanding that a person strip down to his shorts or beyond, do not demand -- have a grand jury demand for semen, not have a grand jury demand that someone bring in a gun from his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.395" offset="13548962">We simply have a grand jury demand that a witness properly before the grand jury make available to the grand jury those identifying physical characteristics as to which there is no reasonable expectation of privacy, here voice and in the Mara case, handwriting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.160" offset="13623986">That’s far as we are going in these cases, I think that’s as far as we need to go.</text>

            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="3383.942" offset="13639137">And that can be done in the grand jury room?</text>

            <text syncTime="3387.067" offset="13651675">Or outside the grand jury room depending on whether or not the witness wants a lawyer present.</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip A. Lacovara</label>
            <text syncTime="3392.087" offset="13671737">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.054" offset="13675604">That’s the limit of all we’ve urged through all the lower courts and here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.386" offset="13692949">Secondly, on the question of the so-called dragnet while it's not clear that a grand jury has to believe that every person that it calls before it has relevant evidence, in fact I think the laws to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.370" offset="13744880">Here the record will show that each of the witnesses who was called and was asked for an exemplar was asked to read a different transcript, a different grand jury exhibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.287" offset="13784482">So we don’t have even the case of 20 different people being asked to read the same transcript to see which of those 20 might have been the voice intercepted in giving that transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.324" offset="13832652">Also, related to that is the reference that my counsel have -- for the respondent has mentioned about the subsequent indictment return by this grand jury in the subsequent suppression, 20 of the 21 people who were called before the grand jury, all but Mr. Dionisio have been indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.406" offset="13920946">And that also, I think under cuts of dragnet of possibility on the Gilbert problem, we should point out that the District Judge that suppressed the evidence here did not rule that there was no probable cause or that the search, the interceptions were unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.617" offset="13981863">In fact, the sufficiency of the indictments has been upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.639" offset="13997955">The evidence, the interceptions have been suppressed because the District Judge believed, the Justice Department followed improper internal procedures in securing approval for applying to the court for the interceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.974" offset="14059290">That issue is before this Court in the Piscano case, its number 71-1410, the Second Circuit again speaking through Judge Friendly has explicitly upheld the validity of the procedure that the Department followed in applying for this wiretaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.309" offset="14124596">The Eight Circuit has apparently also upheld it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.997" offset="14135359">The issue is pending en banc in the Third and the Fifth Circuits and I believe has been argued in the Fourth and the Ninth but essentially the presentation here is that the evidence that was to be used as the basis for the exemplars has not been suppressed on any constitutional or lack of probable cost grounds but simply on what the District Judge thought was the improper internal procedure in applying for the court orders.</text>

            <text syncTime="3541.229" offset="14268270">I think counsel’s argument is a very reasonable one that if the District Court is ultimately sustained in suppressing the evidence of the 25, 15 would preclude the use by the government of this evidence before the grand jury.</text>
