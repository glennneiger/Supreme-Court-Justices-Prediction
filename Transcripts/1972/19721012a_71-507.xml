            <text syncTime="12.458" offset="154185">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.371" offset="165888">The Keyes case is here on writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the Tenth Circuit which in part affirmed and part reversed an order requiring limited desegregation measures in the public schools of Denver, Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.186" offset="229104">Petitioner's submission is that -- is that the Denver system has violated the constitutional rights of Black and Hispano children to equal protection of the laws and that the courts below should have required a more comprehensive plan to desegregate the schools and otherwise eliminate discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.549" offset="306636">Although the case comes from a State which had no statutory dual system, we see the case not as involving so-called “de facto segregation issues,” but rather as one with segregation practices of the kind the Court has been dealing with in the cases since Brown against the Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.441" offset="386152">And both courts below agreed with us but the Denver School's Board engaged in deliberate segregation practices in shams and subterfuges to use the words of the Tenth Circuit to segregate.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.510" offset="442472">But the courts below failed, we think, to accord the full remedy to which the petitioners are entitled.</text>

            <text syncTime="104.363" offset="521885">My task in the argument is to discuss the issues in part 1 of our brief, dealing with racial segregation, the issues you referred, Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.824" offset="559710">And Mr. Gordon Greiner will speak next, to discuss whether the operation of inferior schools for Black and Hispano children also violates the Equal Protection Clause that requires relief.</text>

            <label>Mr. James M. Nabritt III</label>
            <text syncTime="129.804" offset="623658">We think that either ground, segregation or inequality, is sufficient to justify in order to desegregate the schools and argue also that both grounds together justify such a complete remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.110" offset="676843">After I briefly talk about the facts about the extensive nature of pupil and faculty segregation of the Denver schools, I shall argue with my first argument that if we draw only on the findings and conclusions of the district judge, which were affirmed on appeal, the findings, if you please, of de -- of de jure segregation, the term the courts below used, that Denver has a pattern, practice in policy of racial segregation of the schools, which affected a large and significant part of the school system, not just a few schools, not just an isolated or de minimis discrimination but a general pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.194" offset="841206">I will argue that because of violations found below were system-wide, the remedy should have been aimed at all of the segregated schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="217.761" offset="975475">My second argument will be that the facts found below require a conclusion that illegal segregation was considerably more widespread in the -- in the system than the courts below have.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.188" offset="1021137">And that portion of the argument, I will concentrate on the Manual School as a case study to discuss the questions about the burden of proof of prima -- what constitutes a prima facie discrimination and the like, and also, because of the -- the real essential importance of Manual High School as the key stone of the segregated system, sitting atop a feeder pattern involving all the core elementary schools, 11 elementary schools with 3800 black pupils in 1968, feeding into the segregated high school.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.654" offset="1359057">Now, when the case began, the separation of blacks and whites in the system really was very intense.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.873" offset="1379850">Although only 14% of the 96,000 pupils were black, the vast majority were concentrated at a few schools.</text>

            <label>Mr. James M. Nabritt III</label>
            <text syncTime="349.272" offset="1501477">Fourteen percent Negro, 20% Hispano and 65% Anglo.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.835" offset="1531779">At the bottom of page 7 in our brief, you will see the details that -- that -- the details, statistics, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.733" offset="1571380">Now, in these 10 schools shaded in blue, we find two-thirds of the black elementary pupils, more than 5500 of them, going to school with only 150 white pupils, less than one half of 1%.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.589" offset="1634701">Another 15% of the black are pupils who attend the other seven schools, outlined in green on the map, which are from 10% to 19% Anglo and most of those of schools toward the West are majority Hispano, all of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.069" offset="1704709">So, the forum segregation text is either all blacks or either black separated from whites by being all black schools or black separated from whites by being in schools with Hispanos.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.557" offset="1766672">Now that the -- and the secondary schools had -- had the outset of the lawsuit, a similar racial concentration, four-fifths of the blacks and three junior high schools with 4% of the Anglos, 91% of the blacks at -- at two high schools Manual in east and the other 200 black high school pupils spread out in seven schools with 1300 whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.603" offset="1874819">As the faculty concentration and segregation, Judge Doyle found that this was part of -- of the pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.613" offset="1898851">He found that the tendency to concentrate minority teachers in monitory schools helped in his words, helped seal off these schools as permanent segregated schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.512" offset="1938453">He found that the reason for the concentration of blacks and Hispanos in minority schools was, and I quote “because of concern over a possible lack of acceptance by the white community, because of a fear of lack of support by some faculties and principals.”</text>
            <text syncTime="476.303" offset="2009610">So, for as many 10 years after Brown, all of the black and Hispano teachers in the system were assigned only to the schools where black pupils were concentrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.084" offset="2052765">And the figures on the faculty concentration patterns are set out in detail at pages 12 and 13 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.815" offset="2091635">Note particularly, the -- the overall small proportion of black and Hispano teachers, the black teachers were only 7% and Hispanos only 2% in 1968 and of course, in the early years, there were many -- fewer such teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.200" offset="2153179">So, when -- when you see a school with 50% black faculty and assist them with only 7% black teachers, you can see what's going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.634" offset="2194975">And I might say at this point that it seems to me that the Tenth Circuit's reversal of Judge Doyle's faculty desegregation injunction most clearly departs from this Court's holdings, in Swann and the other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.514" offset="2254430">The -- the Tenth Circuit held that this admitted pattern of racial faculty assignments was justifiable because when they began back in the superintendent -- former Superintendent (Inaudible) has said it that they wanted role models for black pupils in the black schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.020" offset="2336455">That of course have nothing to do with it, but they excluded with Judge Doyle's finding that they were excluding black faculty from the white schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.028" offset="2372504">Now, to begin my first argument, as I've said for the purposes of the first argument, we accept as correct the rulings of both courts below on the facts and the law about school segregation in Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.058" offset="2432585">The courts below found segregation illegal only when the plaintiffs were able to prove that the school board's explanation and justifications for segregatory acts, where I quote “a sham and a subterfuge consuming odious intent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="598.367" offset="2497891">This was the highest standard, the difficult burden that the -- that the Tenth Circuit said -- the plaintiff said to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.590" offset="2522760">And even with this excessively strict burden, plaintiffs were able to satisfy both courts below that the Denver system deliberately segregated eight schools attended by 37% of all the black pupils in the school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.903" offset="2583991">Our brief at pages 17 and 18 breaks down those figures in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.258" offset="2601441">It identifies the schools and the percentages.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.349" offset="2613770">Now, the eight schools found deliberately segregated below in row a fourth of the black elementary children, 68% of the black junior high school children and 45% of the black senior high school children.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.335" offset="2673748">And our argument is that properly analyzed, the holdings below showed that Denver did have a pattern of practice of systematic discrimination but justified relief of all the segregated school.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.161" offset="2721081">Now, Judge Doyle found in general that the Denver School Board had a 10-year segregation policy, and he said the several different places in his opinion in several different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.452" offset="2770192">But this is not just a question of numbers or the percentage of -- of black pupils in the system affected by this file.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.900" offset="2796001">It is not just a question of how many schools that's involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.583" offset="2806763">It's a question of policy and that the findings of deliberate implication include policy decisions about all kinds of questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.008" offset="2840409">They were such things as the location in those schools, the place besides of schools, location conditions, the fixing of attendants boundary lines, years of optional zones, years of mobile classrooms, the faculty segregation policy, which was obviously had systemwide applications, and the recession of the three integration resolutions in the spring of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.539" offset="2946570">The only -- now, let me give two examples of how Judge Doyle's findings about Northeast Denver really implicate more than just the schools in the northeast of town.</text>

            <text syncTime="981.519" offset="4030443">Now, we think that proving a policy and pattern of illegal segregation and it's obviously not practical in a -- in a brief oral argument to really get into all the evidence of a trial that took more than 20 days, but the -- but that the findings do properly show such policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.533" offset="4114557">In other race discrimination fields, most notably in cases involving exclusion of blacks from jury service, the courts regard a prima facie case is proved and there showed to be a general pattern exclusion that has been an opportunity to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.807" offset="4183625">The Alexander against Louisiana on last term exemplifies that type of approach and we think something that identical but some sort of similar approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.339" offset="4221764">The development of a prima facie case is obviously necessary in this field, but the Fifth Circuit's recent decisions, en banc decisions in the Austin, Texas and the Corpus Christi case reject this idea which is advanced by the briefs, briefs of the United States, and the briefs of School Board in this case that it's necessary to prove segregation by approving the discriminatory act in every single school in the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.107" offset="4336807">The Fifth Circuit points out that such a rule has never been argued by the Government before in the whole history of school cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.035" offset="4360526">It wasn't long ago that United States was pioneering state-wide school desegregation case against Alabama and Georgia and -- and this new notion that you have to prove school by school was a plain reversal where Judge Wisdom said was the tried and true method of proving school segregation, namely the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.114" offset="4444850">Now, the proponents of the school by school approach must know that they're demandingly impossible, that such a rule would virtually immunize most school segregation for the challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.025" offset="4488526">I mean School Boards don't keep records and -- and very long on this issues, and in this case they weren't any even maps of attendance those in Denver prior to 1960 and it had to be reconstructed by very laborious and painstaking process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.244" offset="4553415">And the basic figures, statistics about racial counting in schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.203" offset="4577238">Last thing, that's a sort of thing that weren't available for many relevant years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.766" offset="4603465">Now, my second argument is that the pattern of segregation was even wider than the courts below actually held because of some of the legal rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.840" offset="4651739">We think that the evidence shows that Manual High School, Manual Training High School is in the classic pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.098" offset="4680788">I was about to use the word of Swann, it was school that was established for one race set up for minority group pupils and planned as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.832" offset="4715687">Now, on that collective brief of the Solicitor General supports that contention that New Manual was established as a minority school with explicit racial segregations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.573" offset="4758737">The little book which is excerpted in the record published by the School Board when Manual was being planned, explained in Exhibit 356 makes it obvious that Manual really was planned for Black and Hispano students as thus the testimony by the -- by the then superintendent, Mr. (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.599" offset="4838776">The book had said that in essence that Manual was going to be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.407" offset="4858002">This is back in -- in the early 1950s before Brown was planned, manual is going to be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.020" offset="4884438">The people were building the school for replacing the older building, special problems residing there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.337" offset="4913695">They had a long -- in the book they had a long history of the racial composition of the school and have gradually changed from white to a majority of black and Hispano.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.081" offset="4964686">So, because of the Manual's different population, they were planning a different curriculum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.318" offset="4989659">Now, Judge Doyle condemned the similar planning of a school in Barrett after Brown but for some reason, he focused on the fact that Manual was planned before Brown as a minority school and we think that's the wrong point that even though what the School Board was doing didn't violate the law of the land back before Brown, they nevertheless were engaging in explicitly racial considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.276" offset="5133542">And Brown applies just as much here as it does in States which had segregation laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.228" offset="5161336">There really isn't time to go into the evidence about Manual about the subsequent boundary changes, but sufficient to say Judge Doyle never found that these boundary changes were rational justified in annual basis – let's get about some other boundary changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.094" offset="5232807">But only that he applied some sort of a notion about the burden of proof which we say and argue in more detail in our brief this cast the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.585" offset="5282753">A point not made very clearly in the briefs is the integral relationship that Manual atop the feeder pattern of 11 elementary schools in the court area plus co-junior high school which feed pupils into Manual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.915" offset="5356105">Segregating Manual, establishing it as a black school atop all these schools feeding into it obviously is going to have an influence on those other schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.582" offset="5422770">I mean, a white person living in one of these feeder schools who wanted to avoid for each child the school which the Board had set up there's the minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.342" offset="5457774">High school is obviously induced to move out of the feeder school areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.458" offset="5486195">So, those are -- if you're interested in what the percentages are, if you add manually, its feeder pattern for the northeast Denver schools, then you really do have 74% of the black in school system involved in illegal segregation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1419.107" offset="5780856">It's the School Board's decisions that determine the racial composition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1428.393" offset="5817950">They constantly redefine what the neighborhoods are so that at the very least, our submission is where a school district is found to be engaged in using chance and centrifuges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.693" offset="5867165">The burden shifts to the Board to show that schools which look at every respect like the schools they found to have been illegally segregated except that they have some rational explanation are justified by some compelling interest of the State and that the State's interest could not have been served by less segregatory results.</text>

            <text syncTime="1622.687" offset="6595145">Quite true, Mr. Chief Justice, that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.255" offset="6609460">And I would like part of my argument will present some of the types of disparities in the allocations of resources to these schools which we believe clearly violates every holding of this Court's sense of blessing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.440" offset="6682185">I would also like to cover, as a second point of my argument, the contention that a need for education for minorities and racially identifiable inferior schools denies equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.164" offset="6729101">And finally, that the trial court formulated a remedy for these unequal and desperate conditions which met the standards and thoroughness, the efficiency, fairness, and rapidity while focusing only upon those characteristics of the system which he felt led to the violation as he proceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.565" offset="6830665">Now, with regard to the schools in question, the minority schools are shown on the map.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.671" offset="6855116">Now, 27 of them to which some 20,000 minority children are assigned, each of these schools have annual enrollments often 29 to only 1%.</text>

            <text syncTime="1727.830" offset="7015717">The blue dots are some additional schools which we feel should also be covered by the findings of violation and that are entitled to the remedy whose racial composition show a combined 70% or more Negro-Hispano involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.799" offset="7095547">These schools have over 40% of the Hispano students in Denver and over 86% of the district's Negro students but only 5% of the districts Anglo students.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.451" offset="7154166">There are 22 elementary schools, four junior high schools in Manual Training High School involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.022" offset="7188438">In considering what these schools were like, well, Mr. Nabrit has described how the administration refused to transport Anglos and of these schools that how they refused to reassign minority children out of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.293" offset="7257610">I would like to tell you a little bit about what the record and findings below tell us about the conditions of the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.812" offset="7299615">The minority student in Denver found themselves assigned to the school which had twice as many brand of teachers, twice as many probationary teachers and only half as many teachers with 10 or more years experience as compared with the predominantly Anglo schools in the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.842" offset="7383730">The -- this was the result of the administration's own policies regarding the assignment of new teachers in the district as well as the Board's policies regarding teacher transfers whereby teachers were recorded preference based upon seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.464" offset="7462201">So, let us assume the teacher had some seniority in school, she would then be first in line eligible for transfer out.</text>

            <text syncTime="1940.126" offset="7864905">Well, even if it meant something, certainly, there was sufficient power reserved to the school administration to take some kinds of affirmative action to remedy the situation that existed in these minority schools, both regard with regard to trying to improve the level of experience there, as well as trying to reduce the rate of turnover there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.884" offset="7963961">Judge Doyle, in considering the turnover rate in these minority schools, found that it was so high that it was actually disruptive of the educational process going on in those schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.566" offset="8018610">And he also found that this constant flight of teachers out of these schools contributed to the aura of inferiority which surrounded the school and reinforced the students' perceptions that somehow his school was a place of less choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.607" offset="8102828">With regard to achievement data, the administration refused to disclose comparative by school achievement data for over 20 years that failed not only to disclose it to the community but even refused to disclose it to members of the Board of Education as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.508" offset="8182450">While the predominantly Anglo schools were achieving on the basis of national averages at or above the 60th percentile in general, the minority schools were only achieving at around the 20th percentile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.063" offset="8236680">The administration nevertheless praised the high achievement in the Anglo schools and the low achievement in the minority schools in exactly the same glowing terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.464" offset="8318286">We have quoted some instances of this in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.646" offset="8338975">Now, this honor and praise by the school administration, both obfuscated the disparity and minority achievement, and we maintain also created and reinforced teachers' acceptance of low achievement that's not only the inevitable but appropriate result of these minority schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.239" offset="8445346">The evidence shows that the administrations set uniformly low expectancy standards with regard to achievement in these minority schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.819" offset="8487664">In our brief at pages 50 and 51 in footnote 57, we show 14 of the schools all with the established expected achievement levels and it sat a uniform 23 percentile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.954" offset="8564255">At the same time, the school district was setting expectancy at about the 50% to 70% range in the predominantly Anglo schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.414" offset="8618068">Now, because they have been conditioned by the administration's expectancy standards, minority student found that his teachers did not expect very much of him that he was neither challenged or motivated to do better.</text>

            <text syncTime="2176.506" offset="8810433">Now, I would like to go on to our second point concerning the law which we believe should apply to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.701" offset="8863201">While the trial court did not find it necessary to hold either that the segregation in these schools or their educational inequalities were the product of racial prejudice or odious intent, he nevertheless recognized them to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.241" offset="8933313">The direct effect to the state action and held that its effect discriminated against blacks and Hispanos but by denying them an equal opportunity for an education.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.154" offset="8985036">Thus, our case is very similar to such longstanding precedence of Sweatt versus Painter when the Court was determining whether white and black facilities were substantially equal under the old Plessy doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.012" offset="9040415">The factors considered by this Court included the reputation of the school, the overall quality of the institution as to faculty in the facilities and even is reasonably as this Court's decision in Swann, the Court pointed as a substantive constitutional violation of the equal protection to disparities where schools do not have like qualities, facilities, or staffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.693" offset="9163191">This, we maintain is exactly the kind of case found and proved below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.253" offset="9193388">I would like now to pass on to the question of the appropriateness of the remedy which was finally put together by Judge Doyle after a separate four-day hearing on relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.180" offset="9257127">I'd like to remind the Court that historically, since Brown II, the Court has looked to and relied upon the trial court's exercise of discretion in fashioning appropriate remedies in school cases and has consistently resisted efforts to limit the tools available to the trial court in formulating an effective remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.102" offset="9352840">In this case, Judge Doyle was faced with a practical problem of carrying multitude inequalities of input environment and output as thoroughly, efficiently, and promptly as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.449" offset="9414175">Here, he did not take any doctrinaire approach but carefully put together a very (Inaudible) based on the realities of the characteristics of the violations he perceived on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.445" offset="9462136">This broad choice of remedy was made after a special four-day hearing in May wherein the Court's words, the crucial factual issue of considering is whether compensatory education in a segregated setting is capable of bringing about the necessary equalizing effects or whether desegregation and integration are essential to improving the schools in question and providing equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.081" offset="9572686">This was not, as applied by the Solicitor General's brief, a decision made in a vacuum because the trial court had had before it a detailed plan of the Board of Education submitted under Resolution 1565 which was premised on the very same types of special and compensatory programs in the segregated schools which the United States contends here would have been an acceptable alternate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.276" offset="9701522">But the evidence presented at this hearing on relief established that minority achievement is improved and integrated heterogenous environment that attitude no disparities and disadvantages such as teacher expectancy, teacher dislike for the segregated school and so forth are only corrected through a combined program of integration, desegregation, and then a compensatory program in the integrated environment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2440.109" offset="9864840">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.369" offset="9897859">I've listened with interest with respect to some of the facts that's been related to the Court and would direct the Court's attention to basic fallacy that some of the facts related extend many years back prior to the trial of this case or the conditions as existed as of the time of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.129" offset="10000886">Both Mr. Nabrit and Mr. Greiner have related facts that should indicate on the phase that we have a static situation and had a static situation for a considerable period of time when that is not the case whatsoever with respect to the Denver -- Denver background.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.625" offset="10094926">And this assess the going into some additional facts and figures with respect to Denver itself and the school district, Denver is a home rule city under the Colorado Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.145" offset="10160964">It has the basic area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.544" offset="10178623">There are many suburbs around it, but Denver itself, at the time of trial, consisted of an area of about a hundred square miles that had increased roughly 40% after World War II by reason of annexations to the city from the surrounding area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.459" offset="10258244">Another Colorado Constitution, the school district for the city and county of Denver has exactly the same boundaries as the city and county itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.022" offset="10296487">And until very recently, the School Board had absolutely no say so as to what areas would be brought into the school district, yet the city and country of Denver wanted to annex it came whether the school district want to do it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.459" offset="10350195">Very recently, that has been changed but the change is so recent as not to be contributory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.621" offset="10378930">The School Board itself had indicated is an elective body, seven members has been for some period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.225" offset="10409336">The general area of Denver with the recent annexation shown on this exhibit, there are -- as indicated on the other exhibit, this was a so-called core city area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.350" offset="10501810">The business district being downtown and the so-called five points area being to the north and east of that area of the downtown area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.476" offset="10578296">Prior to World War II, it is true that the black population was well-concentrated in the five points area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.090" offset="10616748">After World War II, a completely different situation existed and expanded, and this requires again some population figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.514" offset="10662410">In 1940, the population in Denver was 322,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.770" offset="10679442">In 1970, at the time of trial, it was 515,000 or an increased of 40%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.900" offset="10707968">Now, in comparison to this increase of 40%, the black population in 1940 was 7,300.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.825" offset="10739733">It increased, it just doubled in the 10 years between 1940 and 1950 and the great bulk of this increase was after World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.093" offset="10780797">So that is 1950 census.</text>

            <text syncTime="2707.062" offset="10932621">And the black population itself doubled again between 1950 and 1960, another 15,000 or 15,000 to 30,000 and another 17,000 between 1960 and 1970.</text>

            <text syncTime="2730.123" offset="11024886">The Hispano population, we do not have comparable figures, because the 1940 census and the 1950 census did not separately count and tabulate -- you know, the Hispanos as a group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.939" offset="11076190">They were merely listed under Anglo, So, all we have insofar as census figures are concerned, in 1960, there were 60,000 in the city, in 1970, 86,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="2783.129" offset="11236895">Shortly after school opened in the fall, a call -- a call would go out to the principals to report back, Anglos, Negros, Hispanos, and Orientals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2817.293" offset="11373568">So it's -- it's rough but the school district during the years had to -- did keep this, this type of census, had followed the same pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.103" offset="11404810">Now, so far as the U.S. census, I cannot answer, I just don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.774" offset="11427485">As a result of this influx and this is where we get into -- into a very flexible type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.557" offset="11458623">This is City Park, the Square.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.361" offset="11469803">It's about a mile square.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.359" offset="11477849">Manual High is right here, Cole Junior High just to the north of Manual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.674" offset="11507106">Now, this was the so-called five points area until after World War II, the -- the black population was quite well restricted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.848" offset="11547752">There were some exceptions, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.879" offset="11555903">The large number of people coming in and also I think that there is one thing that -- that had a great influence on this and that was the Colorado Supreme Court decision which explains that in 1957 that private racial covenants and deeds were void and not enforceable even went through in this Court as in -- in holding and an answer of the Court at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.791" offset="11659557">So, beginning in -- in the late 1940s when the population influx began, York Street, which is just on the east edge of -- of City Park, as of 1950, and -- and then this is again roughly, but it's best if we can depict it, became the easterly boundary for the black population.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.512" offset="11742417">Between 1950 and 1960, it extended along from west to east and again to the north of City Park, so that what previously was a -- a basically white residential area became the reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.887" offset="11807932">And in that particular area, for example, in 1940, there were only 86 black citizens in that particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.699" offset="11843145">In 1950, it was 898, but it jumped in the next 10 years to 1960 to 8,700 between just to the north of the Park and in 1970, the time of trial, it was up to 10,500.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.122" offset="11908869">So that by 1960, the -- the population that -- the black population had generally moved in and acquired substantial property in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.609" offset="11942828">Now, we come into the Park Hill area where you get to the east and extends from Colorado Boulevard which is the main North-South thoroughfare, six-lane main highway and extends on up to the airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.348" offset="11993819">Those of you who've been to the airport, as you come in, you come right down 32nd Avenue Parkway right through that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.771" offset="12019524">It was a -- a typical middle-class, white neighborhood, single-family dwellings except for Monaco Parkway which is more expensive and upper middle-class neighborhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.614" offset="12074904">And then -- and then after 1960, the movement went forward so that the 1960 census showed in the Park Hill area there were only about 500 black citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.536" offset="12130492">In 1966, a survey, a private census taken by one of the plaintiffs' experts showed that there were 12,000 in the Park Hill area, 12,000 blacks have moved in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.495" offset="12178348">And by 1970, the time of trial, the -- the census -- we didn't have the census at that time but it's been determined since it is in our brief, was 18,500.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.454" offset="12222234">Now, so we and the School Board at this time with a school district which had neighborhood school sub districts including all of the elementary, junior high, and high schools set up, and these schools in the Park Hill area for example and in the area directly north of City Park were established.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.481" offset="12322335">The districts -- the boundaries were established but as the black population moved in, another thing occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.229" offset="12353264">There are more children per family.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.225" offset="12361310">The families were about 25% larger and in some instances families were doubling up in a single residential unit, so there became a very tight situation, an overcrowding in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.854" offset="12419824">And that led to an area directly north of City Park where something had to be done and it was at that point that Barrett School was built, and it was planned in a time when there were no figures as to exactly what the population was by race or ethnic origin in this area, but nevertheless, it went ahead as Judge Doyle found knowing that it was in a transition stage and ultimately it became -- I think it opened 75 -- 70% Negro and all -- very shortly, it was nearly 100% but not quite, and that is the history of Barrett.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.492" offset="12590352">At the same time, they had another situation over in West Denver, Southwest Denver and they built a school over here at exactly the same time to take care of the -- of the overcrowding in this degree, overcrowded area, same size, same plan, and all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.739" offset="12667361">So -- but nevertheless, this was following the neighborhood school pattern that already existed and yes, there were new boundaries set up for Barrett but that was merely to cut out from the other surrounding schools that were overcrowded and to supply a school here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.531" offset="12738518">They got into a big argument in the District Court as to why it did not extend across Colorado Boulevard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.861" offset="12771850">I will point all the details on that but the principle one being that -- two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.821" offset="12791704">One, the traffic as itself which we all are aware of in setting school boundaries, but the second major thing from our standpoint is that regardless, the way the population actually move that at the time of trial, 10 years after the school opened, it was all black anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.841" offset="12863801">So, it had no cause of relationship building in that spot because of the normal neighborhood progression thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.627" offset="12894939">Now, so this was the Park Hill situation over a period of 10 years and what the -- what they tried to do about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.743" offset="12931406">At the same time, these schools were becoming crowded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.842" offset="12943736">They had some talk about mobile units.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.857" offset="12955857">Now, a mobile unit is a temporary unit that's brought in but it's not merely a trader, it's on foundations with its own plumbing, heating, air conditioning, so it's not a second-class facility at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.341" offset="13009774">The evidence was that the Board attempted too that administration tried to find out from the parents what do they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.701" offset="13035165">If they want a children bused out or do they want mobile units.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.161" offset="13053032">And in one school for example, the parents voted for mobile units, in other school they voted for busing out and that's what they got in each instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.483" offset="13094306">But over to the same period of time -- well, we may have to go back and talk about Manual just for a moment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3280.146" offset="13225023">The main problem being that by reason of large annexations in Southwest Denver, I mean in Southeast Denver and Southwest Denver plus this Montbello area that was indicated, there were no money for new construction and they were busing the children in to other schools and so, there was a very substantial number being bused during the same period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.253" offset="13329408">Now, if I may also reply to one point that Mr. Greiner made that they were busing in from Montbello and pass schools and so forth they would be late.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.058" offset="13368592">They had -- had some facilities, some capacities and that's why they were bused over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.113" offset="13396804">Now, the whole argument in the trial court was what constituted the capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.866" offset="13419896">The plan has took the position that all you did was take the number of rooms in a school, multiply it by 30 and that gave you the capacity and that was a rule of thumb that the schools used just in -- in determining how much capacity they had in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.267" offset="13465454">But as -- as Superintendent (Inaudible) justified and he was the superintendent for 20 years, 1947 and 1967, and he was the one who gave the basic history of this period is that the reason they were busing children passed on the minority schools was because they were trying to reduce the pupil per room capacity in those schools and they had extra teachers, they had current professionals, they have the lower pupil-teacher ratio and with -- by a reason of the special clients in these minority schools, if they had a lower number of pupils per room but instead of being given credit for, they are being damned forward on a mathematical basis in effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="3793.090" offset="15276784">First, it was a -- called a limited open enrollment in 1966, and in about 1968, with a voluntary open enrollment which allowed any child in any school in which he was a majority to transfer to a minority school with transportation provided, and that has been true since 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.320" offset="15353689">But historically, that was not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.999" offset="15380438">So, we have basically done the -- there are the constructions made as the one board member testified, two of them as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.008" offset="15412412">We had a need in this neighborhood, we built a school in the neighborhood and just followed the same neighborhood pattern in cutting out the Manual and did what seemed the best thing for the kids in their community and without modifying the neighborhood school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3844.942" offset="15484197">Now, there's three resolutions identifying a -- you know and under that particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.083" offset="15516693">As a result of the influx into the partial area, these schools, the grade schools were fast becoming imbalanced play.</text>

            <text syncTime="3866.010" offset="15568415">And there were -- so we had Barrett.</text>

            <text syncTime="3873.163" offset="15597046">And then, those three added the Smiley Junior High.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.458" offset="15614182">In no time, as there any change of boundaries at Smiley Junior High, even though it became Black by reason of the population moving in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.573" offset="15650649">But as a result of this impact, the blacks moving into the Park Hill area, there was a concern and the Board took cognizance of it and as each will know, a black member of the Board, a very conquering woman was the main focus on this and as a result of various resolutions, they finally got to the point where the superintendent was asked to prepare a plan to attempt to control the racial imbalance in Park Hill, and that is where they began the three resolutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.293" offset="15793591">Of the various schools, it provided and related to only four predominated black schools, Barrett, Stedman, Hallett, and Smiley Junior High.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.106" offset="15844791">As a result of these schools, there would be a change in boundaries within the sub-districts so they would no longer be completely contiguous around the school and they would be moved out to some of the predominantly Anglo schools and some of those children moved in by similar changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.978" offset="15912291">And as to Barrett and Stedman and their feeder, Smiley, -- Hallett, they ran into a -- into a different plan and tried to go into the -- a voluntary plan whereby children predicted in southeast would be induced to transfer into Hallett voluntarily and Hallett children out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.215" offset="16009258">So basically, insofar as the mandatory movement is concerned, it applied only to the three schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.298" offset="16037575">And then there were some compensatory education features that tied into that.</text>

            <text syncTime="4012.587" offset="16154708">So, instead of a four or three majority one-way mandatory busing of these children out from these three schools, there was a four or three the other way and they resented the resolution as to the mandatory busing out substituted a voluntary plan to correct this imbalance or attempt to correct it and retained the other features of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.218" offset="16249271">And as the superintendent testified, this is merely beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.727" offset="16267348">This is the very -- the first step in the test to see if we -- what we could do on this imbalance in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.854" offset="16299844">And also, secondly and this is important, to see whether busing out and -- of the changing schools would affect the achievement of these pupils as he said he was not convinced in the state of the Social Science Education or Social Science.</text>
            <text syncTime="4068.225" offset="16377271">Nobody had any empirical evidence to say whether it would or would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4072.054" offset="16392631">And so, this was his first attempt to try to see what could be done in this regard and so, it was not a -- an absolute thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4081.499" offset="16430352">It was merely one step into developing educational program which he had recommended the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4089.087" offset="16460758">And when it was -- when they took the mandatory part out of it and substituted busing, they didn't changed anything except that one phase of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4096.777" offset="16491478">And also, what is the most important is if not a child had been bused to this point, nobody have been moved out so they are being moved back, and there was no -- there is nothing that had been done except some preliminary planing to implement the superintendent's recommendations before the decision was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4117.962" offset="16576219">So, it's not the type of situation whereby children that were in one school and being moved back into a minority school and by the reason of their race.</text>

            <text syncTime="4863.206" offset="19557209">And I think which one it was that that's going again at co-counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4870.527" offset="19586466">Insofar as the other factors on relationship, the plaintiffs relied on various experts, Dr. Dan Dodson who was the only expert to testify to hearing the merits than on the hearing of the remedies, Dr. Coleman, Dr. O'Reilly, and these were called in and Dr. Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4895.815" offset="19687612">All of whom had no knowledge whatsoever of the Denver situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4899.607" offset="19702868">They never studied Denver situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4901.515" offset="19710495">They had no statistics on Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.510" offset="19718437">They were talking merely as educators or sociologist or psychologist from other parts of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.937" offset="19740170">One originally from Berkley, down in Massachusetts, and other psychologists from the New York State Board Education and of course, they had Dr. Coleman.</text>
            <text syncTime="4918.794" offset="19779563">But again, insofar as finding a causation between racial imbalance and educational achievement, the record insofar as any virtual evidence concerned is as completely signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4934.457" offset="19842257">Dr. Coleman was with of the opinion that it was a basically a culture deprivation in the lower socio-economic family groups and neighborhoods.</text>
            <text syncTime="4943.984" offset="19880291">And that only to the extent that minorities were found in those particular areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4950.285" offset="19905578">Was there any relationship at all?</text>
            <text syncTime="4952.402" offset="19914041">But he was looking solely of the family background and the cultural background of these children.</text>
            <text syncTime="4960.375" offset="19945911">And Dr. Dodson went on agreeing things about various attitudes in this community and of teachers and pupils and parents and so forth, not with any relationship to the Denver situation but just generally as a -- as a sociologist might do, and again, a complete lack of cause relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4981.356" offset="20029816">Dr. O'Reilly, who is called in rebuttal by the plaintiffs and the remedy hearing pointed out that this whole manner of educational equalities, the very unsettled appeal, said many years of experimentation would be necessary to slowly and carefully identify and develop the program to try to eliminate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5003.291" offset="20117588">It's an educational process.</text>
            <text syncTime="5005.532" offset="20126574">So as far as the quarter of schools, we have a finding by the Court, the trial court, which not attacked here that if it is not a Brown situation, no Brown constitutional violation by reason of the evidence concerning the so-called inputs or the allocation of resources except for the teachers and even the Court of Appeals so that there was no plus evaluations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5030.649" offset="20226988">So that what do we end up with?</text>
            <text syncTime="5032.027" offset="20232526">We end up with an educational problem that the educators have no answer for.</text>
            <text syncTime="5037.171" offset="20253111">The state of the science has not such that a district court can decree you shall do this, that and the other thing, but it is something that Dr. O'Reilly said, as Dr. Gilberts, the superintendent of the schools who was the principal expert of defense says, “As we worked out over a period of time.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5053.463" offset="20318208">And we suggest to the Court that this is something that is being done and has to be done but it is not a constitutional violation to remedied.</text>
            <text syncTime="5061.118" offset="20348824">It's an educational problem which has to be handled at a local level and it's something that is beyond the confidence of the federal judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5068.745" offset="20379335">The educators served with all their know-how or having a harder time and certainly, it's not something that can be decreed in such as furnishing counsel, furnishing transcript, furnishing people's facilities of physical nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="5085.415" offset="20446104">And so, basically, on one hand, we say that there's no constitutional violation and therefore, there is no remedy and even if there were constitutional violation, we have to compensate the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5098.152" offset="20496990">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. James M. Nabritt III</label>
            <text syncTime="5105.157" offset="20524993">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5106.232" offset="20529277">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5109.678" offset="20543070">We see the whole case as a de jure case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5113.024" offset="20556445">I think that the relationship between our two arguments is very well illustrated by this Court's decision in 1965 in the case called Rogers against Paul.</text>
            <text syncTime="5124.260" offset="20601480">That was the case to desegregating in Arkansas school system, where the desegregation was proceeding at a greater year of level under the deliberate speed doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="5136.352" offset="20649754">And yet, when black pupils in the high school grades were able to demonstrate in this Court that they were unable to get classes and curriculum in the black school that was offered in the white school, this Court carved down an exception to the deliberate speed doctrine and said, “Under Brown or under Swett, paid her under a combination or merger of the two theories, this was a violation of equal protection with few remedy by integration.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5164.652" offset="20763021">Now, the remedy in the Swett case was integration, the remedy in the (Inaudible) case was integration and it wasn't just based on some sort of theory of achievement that human sweat might graduate from law school and not be a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5182.248" offset="20833343">The inequality was in the -- the opportunity he had and the barriers are put in front.</text>
            <text syncTime="5190.358" offset="20865839">So, we represent the constitutional rights and claimers, the deprivation for the students that fetches at the top of the class at Manual as well as the student that does speak well.</text>
            <text syncTime="5204.792" offset="20923517">Now, we think that for any quasi justice is just for segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5214.482" offset="20962283">There should be no single doctrine or remedy for inequality and we don't urge that sort of a proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5221.622" offset="20990913">What we urge is that Judge Doyle was at least with him at the discretion and listening to this evidence and listening to the particulars of how the School Board said they would going to remedy the inequality, they concluded -- well, it doesn't -- it won't hold order or maybe (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="5239.074" offset="21060712">The way that seems most official, most sure to accomplish equality is to put the pupils in school together, and it was that sort of overall judgment, we think Judge Doyle may.</text>
            <text syncTime="5256.292" offset="21129571">About the question from the Court about the age of the buildings, what Judge Doyle said at Page 61 in 313 Federal Supplement is, “However, we do not think that the age of a building and cite sizes are in and off themselves substantial facts as affecting the educational opportunity offered at a given school.</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.825" offset="21223717">However, we do recognize that in schools which are segregated, have less experienced teachers, produce generally low achieving students.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.456" offset="21262169">The fact that the physical plan is old may aggravate the aura of inferiority which surrounds the school.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5296.112" offset="21288814">And we are talking about the 19th Century schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="5298.979" offset="21300308">We're talking about schools that are built in the last century which in -- in the old part of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="5311.562" offset="21350672">Mr. Justice Powell asked the question about the busing statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="5315.039" offset="21364569">They are set out at page 26 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5318.068" offset="21376690">In addition, there are two maps in the original record not pretty less but large amounts which show the bus routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5325.804" offset="21407619">They are plaintiffs' Exhibits 390A and 390B, which they show the people's crisscrossing the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="5334.880" offset="21443877">There is one exhibit about Manual which is printed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5338.869" offset="21459864">That's the school of booklet that the School Board are published before they set up the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="5346.238" offset="21489330">It shows what they were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5347.724" offset="21495286">It shows the establishment of a dual school.</text>
            <text syncTime="5351.604" offset="21510855">And these are only excerpts from the booklet printed here but the whole is in the record filed with the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="5360.230" offset="21545336">On this question of the decision, Judge -- with the no fancy constitutional theory, it is necessary to support Judge Doyle's conclusion that what this showed in the factual context of the case in the series of things that got going on with relation to these schools was what Judge Doyle said with both of purpose and effect to keep Black get segregated as they are not his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="5386.877" offset="21651916">So, --</text>

            <text syncTime="5395.283" offset="21685561">I think I have the same view that Judge -- Justice Stewart expressed that both of the courts below had found that the segregation in the core area was not the result of the de jure state action.</text>

            <text syncTime="5436.433" offset="21850133">Mr. Justice Powell, I would give my answer by saying that -- I'm dividing the two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5449.774" offset="21903527">I'll say, first on the state action question that we agreed entirely with the process of Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="5456.006" offset="21928396">It's the State running the schools that they determined the racial composition of the schools, so the real question is whether or not there's been discrimination which violates the Constitution on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5474.486" offset="22002375">And I would say that it is not -- I would say first that it is not necessary on the record to reach that issue of whether or not -- whether or not segregation is illegal if there was no racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5497.765" offset="22095475">But on that question, I would think that certainly, discrimination is inferable from the facts, the facts that both courts below agreed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5512.210" offset="22153258">That -- that there is segregation pattern, that the School Board did have all these opportunity and control, that there was widespread -- spread bias in the system and that -- and because of the known inequality of the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="5527.147" offset="22213026">Now, there is one -- one absence in -- in this record and that is the absence of any -- of any evidence about the important factor which is what caused the -- the housing segregation, whether that -- Government was responsible for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5543.354" offset="22277810">There are other cases they litigated where they are including some pending on certiorari where that -- that question has been -- that has been addressed in evidence and -- and that fact findings by the courts on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5559.117" offset="22340817">We -- we don't think it's necessary to -- to reach that --</text>

            <text syncTime="5818.743" offset="23379341">So that when you show an element such as what we have here, a situation to use Judge Doyle's phrase that looks just as if they deliberately segregate and --and if Judge Doyle said, “The results are just the same,” as if they had a segregation policy, but what I find here is that they had A) an explanation, a rational justification for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5845.376" offset="23485921">I say that's not enough, that they have to have a compelling justification for producing this kind of segregatory result whether they -- with or without an attempt.</text>
