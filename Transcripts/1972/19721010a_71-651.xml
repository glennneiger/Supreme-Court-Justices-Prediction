            <label>Mr. Russell Iungerich</label>
            <text syncTime="37.887" offset="254934">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.412" offset="269040">This case arises after the affirmance of the Trial Court judgment dismissing a criminal case after a motion to suppress had been granted in California trial’s court -- California Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.243" offset="324315">It was a People’s appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.270" offset="332466">The facts of the case briefly rose in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.719" offset="354200">An anonymous female informant placed a telephone call to a Los Angeles police officer and informed him that two persons, named Roger and Judy were living at 1901 Nolden in Los Angeles and were engaged in narcotics activities and were also injecting Methedrine into two children living at that residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.159" offset="455973">The officers verified that a lady named Judy Krivda was paying the utilities at that address.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.190" offset="484080">By visual observation and going to that location, they saw two young children playing in the front yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.754" offset="506337">They returned at a later date, approximately a week later, and observed several trash barrels next to the curb on the parkway awaiting pick-up by trash collectors.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.376" offset="548864">They also observed trash collectors in the vicinity with a trash collection truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.465" offset="569240">They intercepted the trash collectors and requested that the trash collectors empty the well of the trash truck and deposit these particular barrels into the well of the trash trucks, so that they would not be conglomerated with the other trash collected from the neighbors in that vicinity.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.431" offset="633083">Then, a block away from the residence where the respondents, Krivda and Minor, were residing, the police examined the contents of these trash barrels within the well of the trash truck and in the contents of the trash barrels, they discovered four to six partially smoked marijuana cigarettes and other miscellaneous contraband narcotic material.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.354" offset="740812">After this, the officers observed, respondent Roger Minor come from the house and retrieved the trash barrels and placed them on the front porch of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.040" offset="779577">At this point, the officers went to the house; they arrested respondent Minor, affected entry, conducted a further search, and ultimately arrested respondent Judith Krivda.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.415" offset="821060">In this context then, two important questions arising under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States are presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.299" offset="864528">The first is whether Fourth Amendment protection extends to garbage in this case, which has been placed on a curb and for all intents and purposes appears to have been abandoned to the trash collector.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.431" offset="921057">And secondly, whether under the circumstances of this case, the application of the exclusionary rule is constitutionally compelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.974" offset="963271">With respect to the first issue, petitioners submit that this case is controlled by this Court’s precedents set in the cases of Hester versus United States and Abel versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.884" offset="1022934">In the latter case, Mr. Justice Frankfurter wrote that there is nothing unlawful in the Government’s appropriation of abandoned property.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.151" offset="1060028">And I submit to this Court that it is clear in the context of this case that this property was abandoned and that the respondents herein retained no further privacy interest protected by the Fourth or Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.320" offset="1136619">Under the circumstances of this case it is clear that they were acts of abandonment, first by placing the trash into the trash containers, and secondly, those -- the abandonment of the trash was further confirmed by the fact that the barrels were placed upon the curb for collection by the trash collector.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.904" offset="1230973">And finally, I think we can draw a further inference of an intent to abandon by the fact that the residents of the house did not attempt to intercept these trash barrels when the trashmen came to collect them or in any manner attempt to retrieve them when apparently they were within the house, since Roger Minor was later seen to emerge from the house and retrieve the trash barrels.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.808" offset="1330552">I think in the context of this case, it is clear that privacy was at in end that the constitution protects through the Fourth and the Fourteenth Amendment, as the Fourth is applied to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.033" offset="1391470">Basically, the fundamental proposition that a man’s home is his castle and the things around his house are protected or when we extend privacy beyond these fundamental principles, these fundamental areas, we get into a very tenuous area, where we don’t have a privacy interest, we don’t have annexes that connects the personal Fourth Amendment rights of the individual with the property seized or the place that is ultimately searched or the material that is ultimately examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.007" offset="1543398">I think that if we look at the text of the Fourth Amendment, it speaks in the possessive that persons have the right to be secured in their houses, papers, and effects that speaks of their papers and effects and that their portion of the amendment ceases, when property is abandoned.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="388.164" stopTime="391.374">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="388.164" offset="1656038">Well, I thought this was a possession prosecution?</text>

            <label>Mr. Russell Iungerich</label>
            <text syncTime="391.374" offset="1668890">Well, I think the question of possession -- I think that was raised in the opinion of the California Supreme Court in a footnote in California versus Krivda, but, I think that if we analyze, we are dealing with two separate matters here as to whether there’s sufficient evidence to convict and whether there is probable cause for arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.766" offset="1738480">And I would present this example to the Court, the example of a man who sees a police officer approaching and at that point he throws a bin with heroine on the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.089" offset="1779754">The Courts have said --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="420.280" stopTime="420.549">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="420.280" offset="1784456">We see -- there are many cases like that here.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="russell_iungerich" startTime="420.549" stopTime="505.929">
            <label>Mr. Russell Iungerich</label>
            <text syncTime="420.549" offset="1785605">-- that the bin with heroin -- yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.833" offset="1798666">The bin with heroin is abandoned, but no Court has ever held that the fact that the man had possessed it recently, had possessed it prior to the abandonment that that could not be used as circumstantial evidence to subsequently convict him of having had dominion and control at the prior point in time, and I think that those two fundamental questions need to be separated.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.688" offset="1894170">I think that the California Supreme Court’s opinion, where the footnote suggests that possibly there would not be sufficient dominion and control is inadvertent and those facts were not before the Court, and I think that it is improvident that that statement was made in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.022" offset="1971493">But, I think that the two questions are wholly separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.303" offset="1984554">The question here is whether or not the police officers had the right to examine this property in the well of the trash truck and certainly these particular respondents had no fundamental right of privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment in the location, one block away from their home, inside the well of the trash truck or with respect to the matters that weren’t -- the materials that was examined, which had been abandoned by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.222" offset="2100224">And, I think there’s no question that they voluntarily relinquished all further rights or interest in that property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1842.290" offset="7472567">I’ll pick up where Mr. Iungerich left off here, because I think it’s important for this Court to realize that this case, People versus Krivda was a second California garbage can decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.939" offset="7515094">The first case, People versus Edwards, 71 Cal. 2d 1096, dealt with a situation slightly different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.041" offset="7543515">In Riverside County California, which is a more rural type of county, the police walled at the back fence of the home of the Edwards’, came upon their property, went into the garbage can and that garbage can was setting on the back step.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.242" offset="7600358">In that particular case, the California Supreme Court held 5:2, specifically stating, under Article I Section 19 of the State Constitution that it was an illegal search and seizure, also relying of course on the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.377" offset="7660857">And I think in this particular case, there is no ambiguity whatsoever and I would like to call the Court’s attention to my brief, starting on Page 91, I have cited verbatim the Edwards opinion, excerpt from the Edwards’ opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.780" offset="7710490">I’d like to simply call that to the Court’s attention on Page 92 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.412" offset="7728985">It says accordingly that search was unlawful under the Fourth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, it similarly violated Article I Section 19 of the California Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2108.107" offset="8535751">Now in addition, I that that the second point is it really doesn’t matter, because under this Court’s decision in Cooper versus California, which I’ve cited repletely in my brief, it doesn’t make any difference, because the State Supreme Court of California is permitted, as far as this Court goes, to provide more stringent Fourth Amendment Protection and this Court is mandating under Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.185" offset="8628120">And, I think impliedly, impliedly the California Supreme Court has given protection to the domestic garbage can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.143" offset="8651943">Now, I am familiar with the fact that the Supreme Court of Wyoming and the Supreme Court of Oregon and several of the lower federal courts have not gone along with protection of domestic garbage cans, but that is not immaterial, because I think that Cooper versus California stands as authority for the fact that a state Supreme Court can give more rigid Fourth Amendment protection to its citizens if it wishes too.</text>

            <text syncTime="2206.306" offset="8928632">The California Supreme Court I think is a very erudite court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.749" offset="8938350">If the courts study these things very closely, it is probably the leading State Supreme in United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2220.455" offset="8985161">Now, one thing I think that is very important in this decision is there has always been, from the point of view of the State of California that this property was abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.442" offset="9021106">Now it’d be my contention, if it please the Court that the concept of abandoned property deals with not federal matters, it deals with what the State Supreme Courts decide -- constitutes abandonment in the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.477" offset="9073246">Now, my opponent has cited in his brief, certain law review articles.</text>

            <text syncTime="2253.580" offset="9117654">I think first of all we got to say that anybody that really overtly places contraband in the trashcan or deals with contraband as vitally concerned with what happens to that property.</text>

            <text syncTime="2289.915" offset="9263000">And in our Supreme Court decision of People versus Erwin, which is the 1 Cal 3d. 423 opinion, the Supreme Court of California again says the following, “Abandonment is defined as a voluntary giving up of the thing by the owner, because he no longer desires to possess it or to assert any right or dominion over it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.247" offset="9332381">And now, the important thing, “And as entirely indifferent as to what may be come off it or as to -- or as to who may thereafter possess it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.857" offset="9362787">And, I would suggest to this Court that if in fact we have a bona fide dealing in contraband, anybody that does that, you’re dealing in cocaine, you’re dealing in heroin, I deal with these people all the time out in California in defending them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.213" offset="9412211">They’re vitally concerned with what happens to it and so under the strict definition of abandonment, it is not been abandoned as defined by the California Supreme Court and that is not, I would suggest to this Court a constitutionally issue, which this Court may take a look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.522" offset="9461426">Question is what is our State Supreme Court said about it, I say that they have said that it is not abandoned in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.172" offset="9492041">Now, further more the decisions of the California Supreme Court again in the field of search and seizure in our Marshall decision of 69 Cal 2d 51 and then our McGrew decision, 1 Cal 3d. 404, there is language in those decisions as specifically preclude the going into close opaque containers without a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.002" offset="9579395">That does not confide the containers in the home, there’s a (Inaudible) decisions, McGrew Abt, so forth in 1 Cal 3d., which proscribed going in to close containers at airports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.687" offset="9626102">So, we have a closed garbage can here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.381" offset="9636864">Not only do we have a closed garbage can, but within that closed garbage can, we have closed opaque brown bags.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.129" offset="9659852">And they could not have gone in those bags without violating the California law, without getting a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.479" offset="9681272">Now, the fact that they didn’t do that, of course, is because the garbage hollers employed the police, as the police -- the garbage hollers as police agents, told them exactly what to do, intercept the truck a block away from the house, go pick the stuff up, make sure the well of the truck is cleaned out so there’s no commingling, take it a block away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.655" offset="9753997">They directed everything they did and it’s my contention that these garbage hollers became police agents for the purpose of this particular pick up.</text>

            <text syncTime="2510.843" offset="10146774">I think the Court’s attention must be referred to Section 6603 of the City Code and Section 6629 of the City Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.510" offset="10201422">Now, if -- it’d be contended that officers are exempted, they’re certainly employees of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.611" offset="10225768">And Section 6629 says this, it says “No employee of this City shall remove or dispose of for said employees benefit or use any of the contents of any vessel, tankers, receptacle used for the collection, removal or disposal of rubbish.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.362" offset="10284805">So, I think -- I -- first of all I’m not conceding whatsoever that an officer in the context of view there is a police officer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2559.699" offset="10342170">And I am not suggesting that this in any way permits police officers to go after this.</text>

            <text syncTime="2567.029" offset="10371532">In any way they’re employees and so Section 6629 does not permit them to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.164" offset="10392012">While in general, I admit the rationale of this Court in Abel, but nonetheless in California versus Krivda, we have a very heavy regulation on California garbage, very heavily regulated and it just absolutely precludes this particular behavior that took place in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.233" offset="10460348">And, not only does the municipal county ordinance is precluded but they taken in context with the Ninth and Tenth Amendment to U.S. Constitution, suggest to me that where the states have not overtly legislated and/or the Federal Government has not overtly legislated then it is up to the citizens, acting through their municipalities, to legislate and these statutes actually absolutely preclude this type of confiscation of the garbage can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.786" offset="10582497">Now, those are the threshold of the laws and I would like now to address myself to the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.200" offset="10604126">Anybody that says in recognizing the certified question, and certified question came up to this Court was whether there is -- whether anybody who takes contraband and puts it an a garbage can and puts to that curb side, exhibits a reasonable expectation of privacy that that garbage will not be viewed in the well or the bin of the garbage truck some distance away from pick up and prior to commingling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.059" offset="10699630">Now, I have a little garbage truck here which I purchased over in Virginia yesterday and this little garbage truck is one exactly like that we have in California and to ensure that the Court understand what California garbage trucks look like, this is what they talk about when they say the well of the truck, this is the well of the truck back here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.641" offset="10773922">And characteristically, these trucks move along the streets in California and they have a very heavy schedule to meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.821" offset="10794611">A lot of homes to meet and there will be a man standing on the back of this truck and a man driving the truck, and they will drive up to a home, this man will jump off at the back of the truck, he will take the cans, he will append them into the well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.077" offset="10839646">He will hit a hydraulic button and within 2 or 3 seconds, it is elevated into the truck.</text>

            <text syncTime="2850.699" offset="11506186">The only thing you can do if you want to get rid of a drawl, just carry it out to the curb side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.707" offset="11522173">You can’t leave it behind your house, because if you do, they won’t pick it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.416" offset="11537011">You maybe be able to do that in some of the small towns I don’t know, but in the City of Los Angeles, the only way you can get rid of it and it’s covered by these statutes in my brief, is to carry it out to the curb side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.775" offset="11574523">And, the California Supreme Court, even in its dissent, in its three-man dissent in the Krivda case, recognized the right of privacy in that can when it was on the back step of the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.284" offset="11616528">But, somehow and I contend this is an intellectual non sequitur, they seem to lose three votes when it was carried out to the curb, and I don’t understand that because this is what people have to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.818" offset="11654666">If you did not do that you would have the home being engulfed in garbage because you never get rid of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.692" offset="11674102">You have to carry it out to the curb and get rid of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.346" offset="11684760">And, they’re doing -- my clients were doing only what they had to do in order to get rid of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.017" offset="11703463">We have a very regulated situation in California, and I don’t think that these people can be held to have given up any right of privacy simply because they had to carry this can out to the curb side in order to get rid of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.706" offset="11750170">And so therefore in my opinion there is no distinguishment between the Edwards case and the Krivda case in the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.364" offset="11776815">Now, I think also of great importance is the following: Is there a possibility of detecting contraband under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.468" offset="11809207">I defend in California a lot of drug cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.939" offset="11819133">I have never seen, never seen at all even licensed chemist who are able to detect contraband without doing analysis and I’m talking here about marijuana and pills and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.887" offset="11866885">You can’t tell the majority of white pills are morphine tablets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.790" offset="11878484">So therefore you have a university trained chemist who has to make quite extensive test to detect contraband and therefore I would contend that the average person who would have a split second chance to view contraband in the well of this garbage truck would have no chance, no chance at all to detect it whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="3073.926" offset="12399052">Now, one thing I think that we got to distinguish here is -- I am sure the State of California is probably not suggesting widespread indiscriminate searching of garbage cans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.107" offset="12439803">If they are, I would contend, as I have in my brief, if this is a mathematical impossibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.626" offset="12457880">It’s a statistic impossibility that there is just no possibility that this is going to be successful when you talk about the number of police that can be devoted to it versus number of garbage cans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.412" offset="12497063">So therefore, we have to talk about a situation where there’s some type of information, some type of premonition that a can contains contraband and in those particular circumstances, I contend that the search warrant is a preferred way, Aguilar versus Texas, Spinelli versus United States, Whiteley versus Warden of Wyoming State Prison, and all the various decisions of this Court which actually require -- and I suggest also Coolidge versus New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.041" offset="12591522">As I read Coolidge in the 91 Supreme Court addition 2022 at Page 2047, this Court has restricted the particular ways of seizing things anymore to either a search warrant or its incident to a lawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.300" offset="12648573">And so, instead of trying to muddy up the waters, instead of trying to complicate the deal with search and seizure, this Court has simplified it by curtailing the means by which somebody can seize something.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.284" offset="12696534">So, I think there’s just a host of decisions going to the merits of the case, going to the law of California, going to the decision of the California Supreme Court, invoking Article 1 Section 19 in the Edwards case and incorporating that to Krivda case would just absolutely preclude this type of thing from happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.213" offset="12764244">And I think the decision of this Court should be nine to nothing affirming the opinion of the California Supreme Court in this particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3202.839" offset="12914709">Now, I think there’s one other area I want to touch on in the closing minutes here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.834" offset="12930696">I think there’s a very pragmatic situation in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.004" offset="12947414">I think that if this Court would at all sanction a search of garbage cans, it is an avenue, if you open up numerous areas of fraud, because a garbage can as this Court I think is almost a judicial notice can be loaded by somebody who wants to get rid of somebody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.622" offset="13005824">If I want to get rid of my neighbor, I’ll go and deposit marijuana in the can, I make an anonymous phone call to the police department, I say, “Mr. Jones at 123 Main street has marijuana in the garbage can,” Zoom! They come over, they descend on the can, they search it, they find marijuana and he is off to the poky.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.376" offset="13068831">And if you don’t think it’s difficult to defend these drug cases in California, well you got another thing that coming, because I did -- do it all day and it’s very emotionally laden and it’s very difficult to get these people off, if they’re caught in anyway with narcotics before a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.328" offset="13124733">They think that they’re guilty, there’s no way you can do it, and I would suggest that if this Court any way gives any credence to the desire to the California Attorney General, we have some problems, we have some severe problems in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.630" offset="13177919">I think also, I think also we have the final threshold question as to the right of privacy of people to live their lives, to dispose of their life’s tracings if might be birth control, residue, or if it might be a particular liquor that they want to use or something I think that it is a severe encroachment upon the right of privacy, if this Court would in any way suggest that the California Police should be given the right to indiscriminately search these cans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.711" offset="13306232">Citing Griswold versus Connecticut, I think that the birth control privacy, the bedroom should be extended to the -- getting rid of that birth control material out into the garbage can.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.571" offset="13349700">And, also I think there is a severe equal protection problem, because if this whole matter depends on where that can might be setting or whether you might be living in a rural area, residential area, I think that -- I think it’s a refinement that we don’t want to go into.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.504" offset="13413439">Many people live in huge apartment houses where there is a commingling in the -- in a huge trashcan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.290" offset="13440502">There you don’t have the problem, because it’s initially commingled, but if you don’t have the situation where you’re living under circumstances like that or you’re living in a private home, of course, then you have to comply with the regulations of the County of Los Angeles and the City of Los Angeles in how you get rid of these materials.</text>

            <text syncTime="3365.862" offset="13566830">Now, no one has said in argument yet about the general attack on Matt versus Ohio, but in the couple of minutes I have left, assuming my opponent is going to allude to it in his closing arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.665" offset="13618030">I think that somebody of my particular educational status is not going to, in the few minutes, in any way, attempt to overcome the scholars of the last 50 years who have considered, debated, discussed, published law review article by the thousands on the exclusionary rule, I think that the State of California is now in a position where frankly there’s been an addition of four new members to this Court and the -- I think they feel that they can take a new shot of the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.449" offset="13749164">And I would suggest to this Court that this Court should not likely consider in a solemnest rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.214" offset="13768182">There is really no other practical way, no other practical way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.572" offset="13781661">Some people may say, pursue of 42 U.S.C. 1983 Civil right suit, but I would suggest to this Court that if somebody is caught with a bunch of cocaine and it is shown to be an illegal seizure, but because you can’t exclude it, the man is convicted, he does maybe ten years, he makes $50,000 a year of selling cocaine, he brings a civil rights suit to recover $50,000 times ten years, or $500,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.264" offset="13884479">What jury in the United States would give him ten cents, a man who is dealing in cocaine, brings a civil right suit to recover money, because he had been illegally searched and seized, can anybody in their wildest imagination should suggest that man would get any money?</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.205" offset="13944142">I don’t think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.857" offset="13946755">There really is practically no relief under 1983 of the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.947" offset="13971205">Some people may suggest, well, we should discipline the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.571" offset="13985625">I don’t think this is practical, I think this has been hash and rehashed for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.167" offset="14000044">It is not a practical way of handling it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.928" offset="14011120">The only way it can be done is by the -- this exclusionary rule and I think that the scholars of the last fifty years, emanating from Weeks versus United States down through Matt versus Ohio have so considered, and there just is really no other way of doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.658" offset="14065977">If the State of California is really sincere in this, I would suggest that this Court may give some credence to a parallel type of relief, along with this exclusionary rule, to see how it works.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.747" offset="14110386">I think Mr. Chief Justice Burger in the Bivens versus Six Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics expressed the reluctance to throw away the exclusionary rule in Illinios and alternate could be selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.480" offset="14161272">And so, I think that if there’s any credence to be given to an alternate let it go in a parallel manner to the exclusionary rule, and let’s all investigate and see what happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.867" offset="14194813">And I would suggest that the exclusionary rule would probably still be in effect, because the alternates are merely shams that they really will not work too well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.084" offset="14243715">California talks about restricting it to substantial violations, and I would suggest that we’re getting into replete additional things, which are going to be more complicated, because then you are going to have got to decide where there is a reasonable or unreasonable search where it has already been held to be somewhat unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.918" offset="14326993">I think you are going to have nuisances on -- nuisances on this particular thing to the point where anybody that would want it had to happen would give up in despair on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.135" offset="14363878">Even in the amicus curia briefs, the reasons for doing away with it, the Americans for effective law enforcement presents statistics that show that the police are doing so well with an 84%, 6 out of 7 cases, the attack on the search and seizure has been upheld as being correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.714" offset="14426258">On the other hand, California in this brief says, “Well, the thing is so complicated our police can’t understand it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.872" offset="14446843">I think that and that alone is reason for disinterested, neutral magistrate, who has had training in law to set and decide if it’s legal or illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.545" offset="14485504">Illinois says and I’d hesitate to admit it that their police are lying so badly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.254" offset="14500342">Every time they get caught and they’re challenged by a judge, where they would be prone to lying in order to get the evidence in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.664" offset="14530017">Well, I would suggest the State of Illinois is a different fact, that’s our admission that they ought to try and curtail their policemen lying and go on the same rule that everybody else goes, a judge is suppose to decide this.</text>
