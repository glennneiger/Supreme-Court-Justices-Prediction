            <text syncTime="56.314" offset="328600">This case is on appeal from a three-judge Federal Court decision, denying appellants' civil class action for injunctive relief to enjoin the deprivation of the civil rights of the appellants and all classified employees in the State of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.525" offset="401429">The appellees with State Personnel Board, initiated proceedings against the appellants seeking to dismiss said appellants from employment by the State Corporation Commission for alleged political activities under Title 74 going to statute -- Section 818.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.591" offset="485752">This action by the State Personnel Board precipitated the filing of the suit in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.938" offset="515114">The questions presented on this appeal maybe briefly stated as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.862" offset="538833">May a state by statute proscribe in broad and general terms First Amendment rights of state employees and two, may a state constitutionally classify the employees of some, but not all of the state agencies and broadly prohibit the employees of those agencies from enjoying First Amendment rights while permitting the unclassified employees of the state, all other public employees and the citizenry at large to freely enjoy the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.738" offset="670281">Now we urge to this honorable Court, that such proscriptions by a state statute are wanting in constitutional acceptability are of the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.440" offset="745096">If the political activities prohibition provisions of the Hatch Act in the previous case are found to be subject to successful challenges as being vague and overbroad, a fortiori the political activities prohibition provision of the Oklahoma Merit Act should be determined as constitutionally warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.235" offset="840286">If however, the political activities prohibition provisions of the Hatch Act are found to be constitutionally sound, it does not necessarily follow that the political activities or proscriptions of the Oklahoma Merit Act are constitutionally well found as said proscriptions are inherently distinguishable from the pertinent portions of Federal Hatch Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1689.908" offset="6862973">In 1947, this Court upheld in Mitchell case and a companion case, Oklahoma versus Civil Service Commission, you have applied the Federal Hatch Act prohibitions to state employees that are federally funded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.793" offset="6930578">The Oklahoma legislature 1959 in enacting the Oklahoma Merit System Act, the Personnel Administration, Incorporated in that act, political activity prohibitions against classified employees of the Merit System.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.585" offset="7001736">This Act is modeled after the Federal Hatch Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.905" offset="7027022">In fact, the Act provides in one of the sections that the State Personnel Board is required and directed to alter any rules or regulations it has, the conflict with standards or conditions of Federal grants recognizing that the federally funded employees that work for the state are subject to the prohibitions of the Federal Hatch Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.784" offset="7142484">There are some differences between the Federal Hatch Act, and our state political activity prohibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.252" offset="7176338">Basically, it's a matter of degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.789" offset="7186578">I believe that the state took the prophylactic approach that was upheld in Mitchell as a method for proscribing political activity on behalf of state employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.393" offset="7240913">In doing so, they did not incorporate by reference any case decisions, as there were none in Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.495" offset="7281351">They did, however, provide that the Personnel Board could by rule enact rules and regulations to carry out the effect and purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.106" offset="7327848">The State Personnel Board has done so, and they continue to enact rules and regulations regarding not only the entire Merit System, but the political activity prohibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.814" offset="7386676">In addition, the language, the facial language of Section 818 has some differences which are not contained in the current Federal Hatch Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.169" offset="7432025">There are references to privately expressing his opinion and casting his vote which I believe has been raised by my brother counselor.</text>

            <text syncTime="2875.175" offset="11604093">The distinction for the prohibitions are related to the enactment of the Merit system of Personnel administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.445" offset="11637112">When the Personnel act was put into effect in 1959, these prohibitions were placed in there and applied only to classified employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.248" offset="11688312">The rationale of the Merit System is to allow the employee to progress in his work free from outside influence including politics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.910" offset="11735019">The decision to exempt certain agencies and employees from the classified system was based primarily on the decision that the populace needs some state individuals to express their will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.689" offset="11806177">In addition, the unclassified employees are not protected by the Merit System are subject to the whims and caprices of their employees so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.902" offset="11842957">They have no recourse in event that they are terminated as to the classified employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.868" offset="11870856">Not only are specific individuals exempted from the Merit System classification, but agencies as a whole are also exempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.930" offset="11911084">While the decision of the legislature to allow the populace to express their will to certain individuals was expressed in the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.228" offset="11948283">They also felt that it was necessary for entire agencies because of the nature of their work to also be exempted, and in this regard, the application of the prohibitions is limitedly applied to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.231" offset="12008260">We think that this is a valid distinction that under the prophylactic approach of Mitchell, the decision to include some state employees under the prohibitions and exclude others is a judgment that has to be weighed by the state and has experienced over the years of the political activity that they are attempting to prohibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.722" offset="12094255">The governor in the state of Oklahoma can by executive order place new agencies under the Merit System or existing agencies that are not under the Merit System.</text>
