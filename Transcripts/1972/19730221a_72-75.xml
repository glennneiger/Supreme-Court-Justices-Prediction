            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We?ll hear arguments next in 72-75, Georgia against the United States.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold N. Hill, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="37.313" offset="252635">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.291" offset="264547">This case is on appeal from a decision of a three-judge court in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.834" offset="286699">The appeal involves the possible applicability of Section 5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, to state legislative reapportionment acts and I think it would also necessarily involve congressional redistricting acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.094" offset="371754">But, it particularly involves the reapportionment act, particularly the use by a state of multimember districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.797" offset="406549">It also involves the Attorney General's regulations for administering Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.055" offset="439568">Very briefly stated, the fact is that the Attorney General disapproved two reapportionment plans for the Georgia House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.783" offset="486484">He objected to Georgia?s use of multimember districts, which Georgia has been using since at least 1880.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.998" offset="523368">When the Georgia legislature met on the last night of its regular 1972 Legislative session and it was unable to divide all of the multimember districts into single-member districts, they passed a resolution seeking to involve the aid of the Federal District Court and this suit was filed by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.208" offset="616155">There are four questions presented by the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.524" offset="633501">The first is, is Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act applicable to state legislative reapportionment acts, and if so, is Section 5 constitutional as thus applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.001" offset="687417">It is the contention of the State of Georgia with respect to this question, that a reapportionment act is not a voting change within the meaning of Section 5, such that it has to be submitted to the Justice Department for approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.729" offset="758262">If we are in error in this contention, then it is our contention that Section 5, as applied to reapportionment, is unconstitutional in that it is not appropriate legislation within the meaning of Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.993" offset="831300">The Fifteenth Amendment of course, being the source of authority for the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the question determined in the Katzenbach versus South Carolina having said that the Voting Rights Act was appropriate legislation in the context of that case within the meaning of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.013" offset="919385">The second question raised, is does the prior submission requirement of Section 5 limit the Attorney General to disapproving the change in State Law or can he, under Section 5, disapprove things which have not changed such as Georgia?s use of multimember districts?</text>
            <text syncTime="224.943" offset="1003186">The third question is, does Section 5 empower the Attorney General to disapprove a State Law which he does not find it to be discriminatory, but above which he is unable to reach a decision?</text>
            <text syncTime="238.126" offset="1055848">There are other questions subsidiary to this third question such as does the Attorney General have the authority to promulgate regulations, any regulations, particularly regulations placing the burden of proof on the submitting state thereby, establishing his civil rights division as a court without providing the submitting state with notice of any charges and opportunity to examine the material on which his decision is to be based.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.735" offset="1178311">The final question is, does the Attorney General have the power to extend the 60-day time limit Congress placed upon him in Section 5 of the Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="279.896" offset="1222928">Does he have the power to adapt regulations and if he does have that power, which we submit he does not, does that power include the power to amend a law of Congress?</text>
            <text syncTime="291.104" offset="1267754">The lower court ruled in favor of the Government on all of these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.810" offset="1294608">Georgia began using multimember districts in its House of Representatives in 1880.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.213" offset="1320208">In 1917, it adapted the majority vote requirement as to certain offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.415" offset="1345076">That is the requirement of the candidate in order to be nominated in a primary or elected in the election must receive a majority of the vote as opposed some states used plurality.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.049" offset="1395545">As a consequence, Georgia has a runoff in case nobody gets a majority in the first election, there is a second election, a runoff election in which the two top candidates compete against each other, so that one of them ends up with the majority in most cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.078" offset="1483734">In 1953, Georgia adapted the designated post requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.165" offset="1504005">That is to say that if you are a candidate for a multimember district, you must designate one of those multimember seats that you want.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.065" offset="1543607">In 1962, the majority vote requirement was made applicable to legislators in primaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.811" offset="1570565">It has not theretofore been applicable to House Representative members.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.934" offset="1591150">In 1964, June 24, 1964, the majority requirement was made applicable to legislators in elections as well as primaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.850" offset="1634722">So, that as of June 24, 1964, Georgia was using multimember districts designated posts and majority runoff requirement as a House of Representative --</text>

            <text syncTime="393.116" offset="1675786">Let me be sure I understand this designated post requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.895" offset="1686967">That would mean that even though you got a greater vote and then somebody else who got elected to another post, if that wasn?t your designated post, you could still lose?</text>

            <text syncTime="642.866" offset="2674813">The General Assembly received that letter of objection on Monday, March 6th at which time it had four days remaining in its regular 1972 session.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.950" offset="2711176">During those four days, it subdivided into single-member districts, I believe 18 multimember districts, leaving it with 32 multimember districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.434" offset="2761122">It adapted the resolution seeking to invoke the aid of the Federal District Court and adjourned.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.316" offset="2788603">That second plan in the 1972 reapportionment plan was disapproved on the ground that it continued the use of multimember districts, numbered posts and majority runoff requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.664" offset="2846072">That had been the ground basically of the objection to the first plan, Georgia?s combination use of multimember districts, numbered posts, and majority runoff requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.182" offset="2900093">The suit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.638" offset="2909915">There was a hearing on April 18th, at which time the Government said, ?Our only objection at this time is as to 15 multimember districts, not 32.?</text>
            <text syncTime="714.935" offset="2963101">As we see it, the Government abandoned its objection to numbered posts, abandoned its objection to the majority runoff requirement and said, ?Our real objection is to multimember districts and we only object to 15 of those, not to all 32.?</text>
            <text syncTime="730.853" offset="3026735">As to 10 of the multimember districts which it had previously had objected to, the Government said ?That the number of minority members living in those districts is so small as to not be cognizable.?</text>
            <text syncTime="746.602" offset="3089742">As to 6 of those districts which had abandoned its objection to, the Government said ?That the non-white population is so dispersed throughout these areas, that the fact that they are multimember district has no impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.829" offset="3154735">You could not cut it into a single-member district and significantly affect their voting impact.?</text>
            <text syncTime="768.567" offset="3177618">The Government also withdrew its objection to the Fulton County multimember district which is at single-member districts throughout Fulton County with three at large above it.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.661" offset="3229968">And they had objected to those three and then they removed or eliminated their objection to that because the difficulty of forcing those three districts down into 21, I believe, is quite considerable and would have had no great racial impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.852" offset="3306768">Now -- but then again said, ?But, we think all of these 17 districts that we?ve, as I see it, we are now conceding that we shouldn?t have objected to on Section 5 grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.802" offset="3382627">We think they?re all ought to be subdivided on Fourteenth Amendment grounds because of equal protection problems.?</text>
            <text syncTime="827.159" offset="3411989">And the court said, ?But, it would be mighty risky to have a special session and not subdivide all of these multimember districts.?</text>
            <text syncTime="835.051" offset="3443545">Its decision came out on April 19th the following day, did not deal with the Government's suggestion that all multimember districts be subdivided.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.094" offset="3479698">And the General Assembly was faced with the special session for reapportionment not knowing whether to subdivide 15 districts or 32 districts. We applied for a stay which this Court granted on April 21, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.830" offset="3554722">Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, contains the formula for determining which states and political subdivisions are subject to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.367" offset="3596831">Pursuant to the Section 4 formula, there are six States covered by the act, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Virginia and there are six States which have political subdivisions subject to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.150" offset="3652002">Arizona has 8 of 12 counties, has one-third of its population covered by the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="895.122" offset="3683871">Hawaii has 80% of its people covered by the Act, one county, but it happens to be, I believe, Honolulu county.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.227" offset="3720234">Idaho has one county.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.092" offset="3727757">North Carolina has 39 of 100 counties.</text>

            <text syncTime="913.137" offset="3755969">I believe the Court is going to have a case involving that situation here shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.159" offset="3776031">Alaska has I believe, petitioned and been removed from the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.210" offset="3800168">But, of these states affected by the Act, only North Carolina and New York have ever submitted, these are the affected States, not the covered States, only these, only New York and North Carolina have ever submitted their reapportionment plans to the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.257" offset="3864430">Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, and Wyoming apparently do not know that the Justice Department is just waiting for them to submit their reapportionment plans before those reapportionment plans can go into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.226" offset="3928273">Basically, our argument on non-applicability is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.903" offset="3946977">There are voting laws relating to voters.</text>

            <text syncTime="976.655" offset="4009984">Reapportionment is not a voting law required to be submitted to Washington within the meaning of the Voting Rights Act we submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.470" offset="4049272">That is, we think what the Government had in mind when it filed its brief in Fairley a companion to Allen versus the State Board of Elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.669" offset="4086053">In the Government?s brief in Fairley, it in effect said to this Court that you?re holding Section 5 applicable in Fairley would not be tantamount to concluding that Section 5 applied to reapportionment and redistricting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.271" offset="4152508">Now you may inquire, held in Georgia argued that Section 5 is not applicable to reapportionment when she submitted her reapportionment laws to the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.470" offset="4201200">I think the question relates only to applicability not to constitutionality because I think, we are entitled to take the position that the Law is not constitutional as applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1215.128" offset="4963871">Let me proceed by saying that the people who made the decision to submit Georgia?s reapportionment plan are not obstructionists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.606" offset="5013817">They know that to make Government work, you need to cooperate whenever you can and litigate only when necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.662" offset="5038059">And they did not know when they submitted the 1971 plan that the Attorney General would disapprove the use of multimember districts and make this litigation necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.887" offset="5078915">Now, if Section 5 is applicable to reapportionment, if it is an election law, if it is covered by Allen and Perkins, then we contend that as applied Section 5 is not appropriate legislation authorized by the Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.656" offset="5158013">For these two reasons, there is no rational relationship between reapportionment and the Section 4 coverage formula of registration test, plus lower voter participation in a presidential election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.006" offset="5223424">The problem of alleged to racial gerrymandery exists in States not subject to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.117" offset="5247875">Texas, New York, Indiana and Delaware have had alleged gerrymandering problems and those states are not subject to the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1320.664" offset="5386010">Let me, to illustrate what I?m trying to get across, say that Georgia has an election code, a comprehensive body of law on elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.933" offset="5423104">If we change 10 code sections and send them to Washington, we think that the Attorney General is not entitled to disapprove other sections in Georgia?s election code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.590" offset="5473782">But here, the Attorney General disapproved Georgia?s use of multimember districts in combination with the majority run-off requirement and numbered posts, and Georgia had not changed that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1479.837" offset="6022771">We believe that these procedures are contrary to Morgan versus the United States in 304 U.S. and the cases which followed it through Hannah v. Larche in 363 U.S. And the final question raises the issue as to whether Attorney General can promulgate regulations in any of them at all, but particularly regulations changing the 60-day time limit which Congress placed on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.903" offset="6122977">The government's brief cites no authority for him being able to adapt regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.829" offset="6150666">They cite is a need for additional information and we submit the basis -- the arguments based on needs should be addressed to the Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="1528.616" offset="6217853">In conclusion, If I may take a hint from the gentleman who opened the City of Burbank case yesterday, in his opening argument he referred to the declaration of independence and pointed out that one of the grievances against the King Laws that he has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained.</text>

            <text syncTime="1565.248" offset="6364348">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.268" offset="6384410">Following the 1970 census, the Georgia Legislature in the fall of 1971 enacted three separate reapportionments statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.923" offset="6431013">One each for state Senate and House and one for the congressional districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.590" offset="6453687">Each of these statutes repealed the previous districting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.637" offset="6469883">The State separately submitted the three reapportionment plans to the Attorney General for review under Section 5 and the State?s submission for the Georgia House which is what is directly at issue here, is in the appendix at page 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.163" offset="6539995">We think it's rather significant that on page 21 of the appendix, the State explained that the Georgia House of Representatives also reapportioned in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.026" offset="6599450">This change was not submitted because at that time, prior to Allen the Board of Elections 393 U.S. 544, it was believed to be unnecessary to submit reapportion plans to the United States Attorney General pursuant to the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.433" offset="6677086">Following a preliminary examination, the Attorney General determined that the data sent were insufficient for proper evaluation of the proposed changes and requested specific additional information in accordance with the department?s published guidelines which the State then submitted and within 60 days of the submission of that additional information, the Attorney General interposed objections to all three plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.664" offset="6814072">Objections to apparent racial gerrymandering in the Congressional and State Senate plans and to certain aspects of the House plan, including the use of multimember districts coupled with numbered posts and the majority run off requirement which has the effect of requiring each candidate in order to elected to win a majority of all the voters in the entire multimember district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.535" offset="6941550">In response to these objections, the Georgia legislature enacted modifications to the Senate and Congressional plans eliminating the racial gerrymandering objected to and upon resubmission, those plans were found acceptable by the Attorney General and those resubmitted districts were used in the 1972 elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.502" offset="7041337">And as a matter of fact, one of the congressional districts reconstituted after the Attorney General?s initial objection, elected the first black Congressman from Georgia since reconstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.912" offset="7090970">Now those Congressional and State Senate reapportionments are not presently the subject of any litigation and are not directly at issue on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.049" offset="7139558">They could of course possibly be effective in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.388" offset="7160874">With respect to the Georgia House which is an issue, I believe the history was recounted by Mr. Hill of how the House founded that they could not satisfy all of the objections raised by the Attorney General and although they abandoned some of the multimember districts, they specifically decline to abandon others and adapt the resolution saying that they were going to invoke the remedial power of the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.669" offset="7314056">Nine days after submission of this 1972 plan, that the state sent in, the Attorney General interposed an objection and three days later, the United States commenced the present action in the District Court to restrain the State from implementing either of the submitted house plans and asking that the legislature be directed to adapt a satisfactory plan that conforms to Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment requirements or in the alternative that such a plan be devised by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.030" offset="7467447">And the three-judge court unanimously granted the relief requested by the Government, but its judgment was stayed by order of this Court and in 1972 elections were held under the 1972 plan to which the Attorney General had objected with respect to the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.774" offset="7558457">The other elections were conducted unto the reconstituted plans, plans reconstituted in response to the Attorney General?s objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.777" offset="7594506">Now, we contend first that there is no substantial basis for doubt that the Congress that reenacted the Voting Rights Act in 1970, understood and intended that the Act would apply to reapportionment legislation as well as to other changes in voting and election laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.502" offset="7689383">The legislative history of the 1965 Act had been in some respects equivocal with respect to coverage and this Court examined that history in detail in Allen against the State Board of Elections which was decided early in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.794" offset="7774542">And it concluded in that case that Congress intended Section 5, in the words of the Court, to have the broadest possible scope and that the legislative history on the whole supports the view that Congress intended to reach any state enactment which altered the election law of a covered state in even a minor way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.474" offset="7869315">That the Court in Allen used this language to refer not only to changes in state law that would deprive persons of their franchise altogether, but also the changes that would abridge the effectiveness of that franchise by diluting their voting power was made clear by the holding in one of the four cases decided in the Allen opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.853" offset="7978820">The first of the district anger at large decisions on this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2020.555" offset="8185605">But what I was about to point out to the Court was that as recounted on page 15 of our brief, one of the cases decided in Allen, a case called Fairley against Patterson was what is referred to as number 25 in this quotation, number 25 involves a change from district to at large voting for county supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.886" offset="8290931">The right to vote can be affected by a dilution of voting power as well as by an absolute prohibition on casting a ballot citing Reynolds against Sims and then, noting that voters who are members of a racial minority might well be in the majority in one district but then it decided minority and the county as a whole and that this type of change is within the coverage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.320" offset="8392704">That was part of the holding in Allen along with much general language in the opinion broadly interpreting the coverage of the Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="2104.407" offset="8521017">There was -- in the legislative history of the reenactment no one raised any question or doubt that reapportion of legislation would be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.737" offset="8562291">The entire discussion was to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.788" offset="8574516">The Deputy Assistant Attorney General testifying on behalf of the Attorney General at the hearings, who was testifying in opposition to the extension of Section 5, specifically said, ?That under Section 5 all of these reapportionments and redistricting plans would have to be submitted.?</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.161" offset="8659989">That was his interpretation of what the duty would be under the Allen decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.942" offset="8691127">Many proponents of the Act referred specifically to reapportionment or redistricting or drawing of new boundary lines in some instances as among the new devices that it come to the floor that could adversely affect minority voting rights and as a reason for extending the pre-clearance, the pre-implementation review provisions of Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.283" offset="8796453">As a matter of fact, the most contested issue in the legislative history in the 1970 enactment was whether Section 5 would be extended or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.475" offset="8845249">This was the major bone of contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.333" offset="8856743">This was not merely a proforma reenactment of a statute about to expire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.804" offset="8878582">The administration had proposed that Section 5 should not be continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.248" offset="8896345">The Act should be revised in a way that Congress after extensive deliberations, after hearings in both houses and after extensive floor debate concluded not to accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.831" offset="8954650">Instead, Congress decided that the remedy provided in Section 5 was needed and the President signed that enactment into law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.736" offset="8998327">It is difficult to review this legislative history without coming to the conclusion that Congress knowingly in effect ratified the Allen interpretation of the statute and acted on the premise and on the assumption that, if Section 5 were re-extended which it decided to do, reapportionments resulting from the 1970 census would be covered insofar as there were reapportionments put into effect as changes by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.702" offset="9170213">There?s another problem that a federal court has, a decree as specific reapportionment as has risen in Connor case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.659" offset="9213994">The legislative history and its recounted in some detail in our brief and in the amicus brief in our support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.935" offset="9247117">All looks in the one direction to the extent that it sheds light on this issue and we think it's sheds very considerable light on this issue.</text>
