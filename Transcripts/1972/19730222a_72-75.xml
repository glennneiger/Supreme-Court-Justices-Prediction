            <text syncTime="242.949" offset="1075179">One way to look at the request for additional information is an objection that the State has not met its burden of proof on the basis of the information submitted and that alternative would be open as counsel for the State said in the District Court here, if the State would win on this issue it would be a phyrric victory, he said, because it would be open to the Attorney General when insufficient information for him to say that it was acceptable was submitted to him is simply to say he objects, until a new submission containing more information is forthcoming.</text>

            <text syncTime="335.042" offset="1443506">But the basic purpose of the Act was to say that in those States, covered by the Act where there has been presumably discrimination in the past, this heavy burden reflected in decision such as Whitcomb against Chavis in this Court, a heavy burden of complainants to litigate under the Fifteen Amendment will be shifted to the State if a change in the State laws is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.687" offset="1554160">The House report is very specific on that subject in referring to the Allen decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.168" offset="1584044">It says, the Court there discussed the history of the enforcement of Section 5 and clarified its scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.650" offset="1605987">The decision underscores the advantage Section 5 produces in placing the burden of proof on a covered jurisdiction to show that the new voting law or procedure does not have the purpose and will not have the effect of discriminating on the basis of race or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.316" offset="1672652">Now, that basic purpose of the Act would be entirely emasculated if the alternative were open to the State to make the submission to the Attorney General do not have to bear that burden of proof.</text>

            <text syncTime="855.179" offset="3524106">Is it your position -- well we have in Georgia a number of districts and is it your position that even if no change is made by the State in a particular district, that the Attorney General can still disapprove that district if changes are made in other districts of the State?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="873.806" stopTime="1082.837">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="873.806" offset="3598608">Well, we took that position in the District Court and we adhere to it in the context of the pervasive reapportionment that was enacted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.355" offset="3640822">The prior apportionment was repealed and the State reconsidered every district and drew new district lines and reapportioned every one.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.903" offset="3678960">As a matter of fact, the changes were very pervasive here.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.120" offset="3695888">Most districts had new boundary lines under both the 1971 and 1972 plans and many of those who did not have new boundary lines had a different number of representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.413" offset="3741027">And there was really a change even in the few districts that had the same boundary lines, the same number of representatives because they were sending those representatives to a State House of Representatives which would have 25 fewer total members.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.653" offset="3797974">So, on the facts of this case, it can really be said that there is no district which remained unaffected by the reapportionment legislation and we did take the position that the entire reapportionment was up for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.926" offset="3887104">Now, as I understand the position of the State, they say yes, there were changes that were subject to review under Section 5, but that the Attorney General?s objection is invalid because what he objects to is an aspect that really wasn?t changed, and we have two answers to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.635" offset="3977906">In the first place, as we understand it, that?s a contention that the objection is not well-founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.686" offset="4006118">That the objection is lacking in merit and under Allen and Perkins, Congress has specified that that question can be litigated only in the District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.639" offset="4069961">That is the contention that goes to the merits and not to rather -- there was a change which had to be submitted here, but we believe that the objection is well-founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.318" offset="4124609">We see no way to administer the Act other than to consider the implementation, the effects of the implementation of the change and the context in which they will be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.368" offset="4176854">The Act says that if implementation of that change will have the purpose or effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race, then that change should not be implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.711" offset="4230248">It doesn?t say that it has to deny or abridge the right to vote more than it has previously been denied or abridged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.830" offset="4262640">And in South Carolina against Katzenbach, the Court, I think very carefully specified that the pre-implementation review was required by Congress, so that changes in the election laws could not be used to perpetuate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.144" offset="4323976">The word used there was ?perpetuation,? to perpetuate the discrimination on account of race in voting in elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.604" offset="4361801">And so while we believe that the matter is not really before this Court, we think the objection was well-founded here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.644" offset="4409971">Unless there is no further question, I think that presents our case.</text>
