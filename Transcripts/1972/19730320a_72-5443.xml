            <label>Mr. Malcolm H. Mackey</label>
            <text syncTime="53.163" offset="316061">Thank you Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.731" offset="390248">Mr. Chief Justice and other members of the Court, I'll try to keep my argument relatively brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.244" offset="436328">Most of my argument, of course, is in the brief submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.958" offset="455241">I did -- I do wish to point out, though I haven't filed a reply brief, I do wish to point out that I did discover a Law Review Article, Stanford Law Review Article and I would like to mention it to the Court, Volume 23, pages, it's a rather long article, 341 to 355, reviews the and I just discovered it in going through the argument, hits it on, I don't think it changes, it does have some reflection, but I call it hits it right on the button as to these presumptions, so called inferences that we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.006" offset="643427">That article and I bring it up at this point, states that there were three reasons why the rational connection test fails.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.357" offset="684805">One that the right allows the prosecution to get it's case to the jury without producing any evidence of a prohibitive effect of a material element of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.750" offset="726392">Two, that the presumption of the evidence is insufficient evidence to justify a finding of reasonable doubt and that, generally flatly this article states that rational connection or not all of these presumptions or inferences are unconstitutional as in giving sort of a directed verdict for the prosecution on the one element of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.754" offset="842376">I would like to go back to the pure unadulterated constitution Fifth Amendment, “no person should be compelled as a witness” and we look at that little sentence or segment of the sentence, we find that, compelled to -- against the witness himself, we find nothing about a rational connection test naturally and going to the Sixth Amendment which says that “no one shall be confronted.”</text>
            <text syncTime="218.124" offset="975914">They will be confronted with witnesses against them and in this case, I think, we are confronted with an inference against them which says as in the Barnes case, Mr. Barnes to not take the witness stand and he is confronted with this problem of getting over the hurdle.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.852" offset="1050728">If he takes the witness stand, of course, he puts himself in pandora's box into the fire and then I don't think he can use the constitutional prohibitions.</text>

            <text syncTime="252.445" offset="1113109">And all the things that you just said true of a large area of what we vaguely call circumstantial evidence, evidence of circumstances?</text>
            <text syncTime="263.184" offset="1156159">You can't -- you don't have confrontation in the sense you are arguing, when you are confronted with a set of circumstances and isn't this very close to a circumstance?</text>

            <text syncTime="274.067" offset="1199626">It's close with distinctions, naturally circumstantial evidence, you don't have to see the boy eating the cookie, if you see the broken cookie jar, that's the old, the cookie jar analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.113" offset="1259813">You see the boy with a cookie jar and you see cookies on his face, that's circumstantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.424" offset="1277053">But aren't we doing something else with the inferences?</text>
            <text syncTime="298.225" offset="1296280">Aren't we saying that this -- we're applying knowledge to it and that's the problem that I see.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.317" offset="1332642">I think there is a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.799" offset="1338598">We have circumstantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.459" offset="1345181">Certainly in Civil Law, we have this situation, you can put a person on and we don't have any constitutional probation, you can call a person under 776 of the Evidence Code in California and put him on and elicit all the information from.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.224" offset="1412263">We have (Inaudible) with it where we have presumed that certain elements in a civil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.090" offset="1439744">I don't think that these elements, we could say, a person who is (Inaudible) with one of these mafia groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.042" offset="1495542">That his presence there is some evidence that he knows the conspiracy that's going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.680" offset="1526053">But I don't think we want to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.924" offset="1531068">I don't think that we want to limit the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.810" offset="1546637">Therefore, I feel that we should knock out these inferences or as in the Roger's case, no matter how piously, and the Court said, in that case, no matter how piously we state to the contrary that these inferences are in the jury's mind, that they could --</text>

            <text syncTime="853.626" offset="3517837">The petitioner in this case was convicted under six counts of an indictment growing out of the fact of two treasury checks from the mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.537" offset="3557543">He was first convicted in two counts of unlawfully having possession of property stolen from the mail, that is the two treasury checks, he was then convicted of forging the two treasury checks and finally he was convicted of uttering the two treasury checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.139" offset="3627969">As is true in most of cases of this type the evidence was largely circumstantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.925" offset="3651062">And the principle issue in the case is whether the judge correctly instructed the Jury that in determining whether petitioner had knowledge that this property was stolen, which is one of the elements of the offensive, possessing stolen property, whether the jury probably could infer from the fact of unexplained possession of recently stolen property together with all of the other evidence, that the petitioner knew the property was stolen.</text>

            <text syncTime="974.688" offset="4002147">Now, what was the evidence before the jury, which led it to convict the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.429" offset="4029106">The starting point of this story is that 2nd of June in 1971, in which the petitioner whose name is James Edward Barnes opened a bank account under the name of Clarence Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.589" offset="4081768">Approximately a month later on the 1st of July, it was stipulated that the government mailed a treasury check representing retirement to a lady named Nettie Lewis for $269 and that two days later the government mailed a similar check for $286 to a lady name Mary Hernandez covering social security payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.498" offset="4177377">Both of these ladies testified, they never received those checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.273" offset="4196498">Five and seven days after these mailings in a different branch of the bank, petitioner deposited these two checks, each of these checks had on it the endorsement respectively of Nettie Lewis and Mary Hernandez, and also the name, Clarence Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.377" offset="4264835">The two recipients of the checks who never got them, testified they didn't know petitioner, they never authorized petitioner to deposit the checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.506" offset="4305377">A handwriting expert, who had taken handwriting exemplars from the petitioner, testified that upon comparing the exemplars with the signatures on the checks, that petitioner was the man who signed all three names that is Nettie Lewis, Mary Hernandez, and Clarence Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.024" offset="4403493">Now, petitioners' side of the story was presented through the testimony of the postal inspector and petitioner's counsel told the Jury in his closing argument that since the postal inspector had presented petitioner side of the case, there was no need for him to be called to the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.600" offset="4477785">The testimony he gave was that he said he was in the furniture business and that these checks have been presented to him by men and women, who are going out selling furniture door-to-door.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.934" offset="4523133">He was unable to identify any of the people who allegedly sold the furniture for him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1205.605" offset="4925837">What the court said, and this is set forth at footnote 6 of the bottom of the page 7 of our brief is that possession of recently stolen property, if not satisfactorily explained is ordinarily a circumstance from which you may, may reasonably draw the inference and find in the light of the surrounding circumstances shown by the evidence in the case, that the person in possession knew the property had been stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.882" offset="5034924">The court then immediately charged the jury, however, you are never required to make this inference, because he said it's the exclusive province of the jury to determine whether the facts and circumstances shown by the evidence in this case, ward any inference which the law permits the jury, not requires, permits the jury to draw from the possession of recently stolen property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.657" offset="5121964">And then, as saying in considering whether possession of recently stolen properties have been satisfactorily explained, and court reminded the jury that the accused need not take the witness stand and testify and finally he pointed out, “That possession maybe satisfactorily explained through other circumstances, other evidence independent of any testimony of the accused.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.142" offset="5207960">And of course, as the accused's counsel stated to the jury he had attempted to explain his possession through this rather incredible statement that he made to the postal inspector.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.540" offset="5249546">Finally, the judge charged the jury of two or three other things.</text>
