            <label>Mr. Bernard A. Berkman</label>
            <text syncTime="38.119" offset="255875">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.311" offset="272593">This case raises squarely, the question of the continuing vitality of the mayor's court system and a dispensation of roadside justice in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.402" offset="320972">Specifically, the issue here is whether a mayor charged with the financial and law enforcement responsibilities for the village of which he is executive and the administrative head can serve as an impartial judge and fact finder in criminal proceedings without violating the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.617" offset="421804">The facts which give rise to this issue are briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.917" offset="447091">Actually, the petitioner was convicted of a couple of traffic offenses in the mayor's court in Monroeville.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.816" offset="470601">He was convicted of offenses which are violations of ordinances of that incorporated village.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.960" offset="499231">Monroeville is a small, uncharted, incorporated village in North Western, Ohio and Huron County through which a main truck in auto highways state route 20 rise.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.928" offset="547088">It carries a considerable amount of truck traffic and from time to time, public utilities commission state officials conduct safety checks at its village boundaries in cooperation with village constables.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.844" offset="602781">And the record reveals that in some instances when these safety checks occur up to 20 arrests per day, happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.302" offset="640606">In this particular instance, the petitioner was convicted of failure to comply with a lawful order of the police in and which it was contended that he did not stop within a reasonable period of time after having been waived down in order to participate in one of these PUC traffic checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.976" offset="723257">And secondly, he was charged with failure to produce a driver's license upon request of a police officer in an altercation, which occurred after he did stop his truck somewhat at the road during which an episode of shooting of Mace and so on occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.954" offset="823150">Petitioner was tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.255" offset="832345">He interposed the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.413" offset="849063">He was convicted and fined the maximum of $50 cost in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.778" offset="874454">The constitutional question which is here presented was preserved by affidavit to disqualify the mayor as judge, a motion to dismiss the prosecution or any alternative to certify to a proper court.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.301" offset="928580">In all of these instances, the petitioner was frustrated and a number of it has occurred during the course of the trials and both trials ultimately in the Court of Appeals were consolidated so that they are here presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.140" offset="991901">A number of rather aberrant episodes occurred during which the mayor sought to shift the burden of going forward to the accused, a period that somewhat surprised and amazed the defense council would even challenge the credibility of a uniformed officer under oath, abandoned to the police officer witness the right to determine whether he need to answer questions put to him by defense council.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.573" offset="1101615">And as a layman, not a lawyer relied rather substantially and heavily upon the prosecutor's legal advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.117" offset="1151875">At a hearing conducted on the affidavit to disqualify, some additional information of relevance and importance to the constitutional question here presented emerged.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.469" offset="1193253">It was demonstrated that from the years 1964 through 1968, the five previous years, prior to the conviction that of the total number of -- total amount of money in the village's general funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.240" offset="1272351">In each year somewhere between 36% and 51% of all of the general revenues of the village came from fines assessed in the mayor's court.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.326" offset="1332642">In addition, it appeared in 1959, at the time when the village was concerned that the jurisdiction of mayor's courts was to be less the alarm that the village had with respect to the fact that the lessening of jurisdiction of mayor's courts would somehow rather affect adversely its physical position is demonstrated by a Village Ordinance 59-9 in 1959 in which an expert was hired in, at least partially, in concern over the fact that the decrease in the jurisdiction of the mayor's courts would involve some increased tax responsibilities are curtailed services for the members of the village.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.438" offset="1517171">That ordinance is reproduced in our brief and also appears in the -- in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.179" offset="1556041">As a matter of state law and as a part of the hearings, a number of other important constitutional facts were developed in the case below.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.592" offset="1589791">In the first place, it was established in the law of Ohio's clearance, I think, that the mayor is the chief law enforcement officer of the village with the power to hire, fire, and supervise the police chief and all the members of the -- of the police force.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.808" offset="1654575">He has the -- he has the power as the sheriff and is to enforce the -- the piece in the -- within its boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.848" offset="1686758">And in this instance, he was -- he had the power to do and actually did appoint -- the police chief who was the principal witness against the accused in this case and had, as a matter of fact, to determine the credibility of his employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.331" offset="1764707">It is true that there is some approval required of council in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.313" offset="1792606">But the -- the principal responsibility in the chief law enforcement officer I think without question is the mayor who sits as the judge in these kinds of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.524" offset="1829491">The Ohio Revised Code Section 73715, 18, 73330 and 190520 made very clear his position as chief law enforcement officer in the village.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.296" offset="1876511">In addition, it was developed and the law is also clear that the mayor is the chief executive of the village with financial responsibility for its physical condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.984" offset="1911306">He is required to report his physical condition in the event that there were excess expenditures or expenditures which are improper, he is required to enforce it and Ohio Revised Code Section 73332 and 73333 make that abundantly clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="492.694" offset="2074102">It was also developed that the mayor is not a lawyer, not subject to the canons of judicial ethics and yet required by law to make procedural and evidentiary rulings under Ohio Revised Code Section 293815.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.866" offset="2122794">And that, inasmuch, as he was not a lawyer, the person from whom he sought his legal advice was the village solicitor who happened to be the prosecutor in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="530.983" offset="2227284">Our contention was that coupled with all of the other factors which keep the -- the tribunal from seeing the -- the situation in a neutral manner, add to the situation which he is obtaining all of his information, including matters of admissibility of evidence and so on from a -- a source which is biased in one direction of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="570.370" offset="2384854">As a matter of a fact, what we are saying is that the entire composite of circumstances under the statutory scheme which has established mayor's courts has both executives in charge of the functions of their village and also to see it as a neutral and detached magistrate in -- in criminal manners, is in itself a denial of due process.</text>
