            <text syncTime="9.879" offset="142921">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.502" offset="165386">Section 1952 of Title 18 of the Code makes it illegal for anyone to use â€œAny facility of interstate commerce with intent to promote or facilitate the operation of a gambling business which is illegal under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.531" offset="233514">Petitioners who were engaged in illegal bookmaking operations in Hammond, Indiana were convicted of violating the statute because they caused copies of horse racing scratch sheet to be carried by railroad from Chicago, Illinois to Hammond, Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.437" offset="301119">On appeal to the Court of Appeals, the petition is argued that causing the use of a facility of interstate commerce to transport a newspaper or similar publication was not intended to be covered by 1952 as evidenced by the fact that a companion statute, 1953 which prescribes the interstate transportation of gambling paraphernalia contains an expressed exception from newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.155" offset="411982">The Court of Appeals rejected this argument and affirmed the convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.429" offset="429119">Because this decision conflicted with the previous decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, we granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.078" offset="459734">For reason set forth in an opinion on file with the clerk of this Court, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.238" offset="488364">We hold that Congress did not intend to accept one who causes the use of a facility of interstate commerce to transport a newspaper, with an intent to promote an illegal gambling business from the prohibition set forth in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.241" offset="548342">Mr. Justice White took no part in the decision of this case.</text>
