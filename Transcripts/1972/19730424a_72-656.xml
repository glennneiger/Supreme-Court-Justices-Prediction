            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We’ll hear arguments next this morning in number 72-656, Logue against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.336" offset="164760">Mr. DeAnda.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_deanda" startTime="16.776" stopTime="295.847">
            <label>Mr. James Deanda</label>
            <text syncTime="16.776" offset="170506">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.552" offset="189628">This is a case arising under the Federal Tort Claims Act resulting from the suicidal death of a federal prisoner confined in a state facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.342" offset="240724">The District Court, in this instance, found both the Marshal and the sheriff, the state official involved, negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.014" offset="287431">It found the marshal negligent in not making arrangements for a constant surveillance of the deceased and found the sheriff negligent for making inadequate-- for having inadequate surveillance procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.941" offset="359111">The Circuit Court approved the findings of the Trial Court but held that, insofar as the Marshal’s negligence was concerned, that the Marshal had no authority to control jail functions and, therefore, no duty of safekeeping of the prisoner and that, insofar as the Sheriff is concerned, that he was an independent contractor as defined under the Tort Claims Act and, therefore, the government had no liability for his conduct which brings us to the issue in the case which is whether or not the United States can exempt itself from liability under the Federal Tort Claims Act for a negligent injury to a prisoner by simply turning him over to a local jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.951" offset="599228">This is extremely important because if this were the law, first of all, you would have two standards insofar as the-- as persons in detainment are concerned, that is federal prisoners in non-federal institutions, would have the benefit of the Tort Claims Act remedies, nor will they have the rights of the protection afforded by the-- by Section 4042 and 4086 which requires the Bureau of Prisons to safely keep the prisoner and require the US Marshal to safely keep his prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.800" offset="766621">It would also result in a situation where, actually, a-- where, in the usual case where a man has been convicted of a crime is confined in a federal institution has really more rights than one who is simply charged with a crime that has not yet been tried because, I believe as statistic shows that are in the record in this case, the persons that are confined in state institutions for the most part are persons who have not yet been convicted of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.246" offset="928371">As a matter of fact, I believe the record was that there were approximately 4,000 federal prisoners in one day that are confined in state institutions of various types and, for the most part, awaiting trial on different offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.790" offset="1002559">The dissenting-- there was a motion filed in a hearing involved before the circuit which was denied by the circuit, but there was a dissent filed in that matter, and the basis of the dissent was that the breach of the statutory duty on the part of the Marshal occurred when the prisoner was confined in the jail under circumstances that the Marshal knew were dangerous and without taking specific precautions.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.677" offset="1146128">In other words, the dissent stated that, really, whether or not the-- that this contract between the government and the Nueces County Jail was really irrelevant and that the Marshal himself was guilty of acts of negligence in taking this man and turning him over to the Sheriff of Nueces County without making assurances that he would be cared for, knowing the very peculiar and special circumstances that surrounded the case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="295.847" stopTime="301.226">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="295.847" offset="1286771">Mr. DeAnda, would that be negligence in selecting the contractor basically?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_deanda" startTime="301.226" stopTime="431.880">
            <label>Mr. James Deanda</label>
            <text syncTime="301.226" offset="1308296">No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.536" offset="1309550">I don’t believe-- Mr. Justice, I do not believe that the negligence would be in selecting the contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.576" offset="1341628">The negligence would be in, and the negligence that the Court found was in not making arrangements for the man to be-- the arrangements that were necessary under the record to keep the man safely that is, the marital, for example, even though he took the man to jail could have, just as they had a guard for him at the hospital after his first suicidal effort could have gotten a guard for him to watching and maintain constant observation while the man was in jail and the-- although the government places a great deal of weight on the inability of the Marshal to control the things in the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.996" offset="1523336">The truth of the matter is that everything that occurred in that jail when this man was returned was done so with the blessings and at the suggestion of the Marshal.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.012" offset="1567431">Everything that the jailer did, the type of cell that the man was putting him was all done because the Marshal wanted it done that way, and the contract with the-- between the government and the jail permits this.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.084" offset="1647679">The-- there’s a real question in my mind that there’s anything approaching an independent contractor situation here in a situation of this type because the regulations of the Bureau of Prisons, as shown in the transcript, really live it up to the Marshal when a particular unusual situation occurs, specifically either a medical situation or one involving custodial problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.694" offset="1766170">That’s not the not the run and the mill case where the sheriff is just simply babysitting with somebody that’s in jail and charged with a crime, that he is to call the Marshal and find out what the Marshal wants done with the man and how he wants a particular situation handled.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="431.880" stopTime="462.676">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="431.880" offset="1830849">Well, is this an argument that even if the state official-- the relationship between the United States and the state jail or prison was one of independent contractor, even if it was, that under these circumstances it was negligent for the Marshal to have lodged the man there without first making certain that whatever the independent contractor did, he did to safeguard this fellow from committing-- attempting suicide again.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.503" offset="1949341">Is that it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_deanda" startTime="462.676" stopTime="524.183">
            <label>Mr. James Deanda</label>
            <text syncTime="462.676" offset="1954043">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.208" offset="1956237">That’s exactly my position.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.690" offset="1962088">In other words, in this particular case, the man was removed from the hospital over the protest of the doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.101" offset="1995734">Now, the doctor did release the man, but he released the man because he thought he had been ordered to do so by a federal judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.371" offset="2032828">That was as circumstance under which the man was released from jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.025" offset="2047457">He was psychotic when he went in. he was psychotic when he went out.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.303" offset="2064593">There had been absolutely no improvement or change in the prisoner’s condition psychiatrically from the time he was put in jail to the time he was taken out.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.861" offset="2106807">He was only in-- I’m sorry, in the hospital, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.154" offset="2131989">The medical test only is that the man’s condition-- mental condition was exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.109" offset="2159783">He had been placed under some sort of a drug treatment and had been administered some medication which did help.</text>

            <text syncTime="524.183" offset="2200116">But did the Marshal had any choice but-- when he was released from the hospital to put him in this very jail?</text>

            <text syncTime="535.102" offset="2243793">He could’ve been moved in 24 hours according to-- in an emergency situation, they could either-- in fact, the federal judge already ordered that the man be confined in a medical facility, and he was returned to the jail awaiting transfer to Springfield, I believe, when someone came to get him.</text>

            <text syncTime="569.936" offset="2383078">I guess he could’ve put him anywhere he wanted to put him, I would suppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.143" offset="2395930">But, I do not believe that, from a realistic stand point, I think his choices would have been a jail like the Nueces County Jail.</text>

            <text syncTime="1722.197" offset="6992123">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.949" offset="7003199">The government’s position, simply stated, is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.760" offset="7014379">First, although the United States would be liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act for injury to a federal prisoner caused by the negligence by a federal Marshal, the deputy marshals here acted reasonably, in accord with due care and they violated no duty owed to Regan Logue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.437" offset="7077073">Second, because the United States had no right to control the physical conduct of the jailers employed by the county jail, the government cannot be liable under the Tort Claims Act for injury resulting from the negligent conduct of those employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.609" offset="7133811">I think, in light of Mr. DeAnda’s argument that it might be fruitful to start with a focus on the precise findings that the District Court made for the respect of both of these points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.727" offset="7174248">They appear in Volume 2 of the appendix at pages 608 and 609.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.254" offset="7196400">The important point to make, I think, is that the only federal officer whom the District Court found to be negligent was Deputy Bowers, that is the deputy who was on the scene in Corpus Christi, and his negligence, in the Court’s view, consisted solely in the-- of failing to make “specific arrangements” for Logue’ s surveillance while he was confined to the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.068" offset="7283649">There is no finding that Bowers was negligent in removing Logue from the hospital and, as Mr. DeAnda stated here, the District Court found that to be a discretionary act and that matter was not argued on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.052" offset="7335581">Moreover, there’s no finding that any other federal officer was negligent in any way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1818.373" offset="7376854">Second, at the top of page 609, the District Court found that the jail’s employees were negligent in failing to provide adequate surveillance while Logue was confined in the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.331" offset="7420740">The Court of Appeals did not disturb the District Court’s findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.680" offset="7438085">That is, it did not disagree that Bowers had failed to make specific arrangements for Logue’s surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.687" offset="7458147">It held, however, that in the circumstances of this case, that failure did not violate any duty owed to Logue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.269" offset="7484479">In our view, the record fully supports this holding because it shows that the specific arrangements for Logue’s surveillance, that is, the arrangements that Bowers failed personally to make were, in fact, made by Bowers’ supervisor, Deputy Jones.</text>

            <text syncTime="2546.584" offset="10289716">Now, he specifically suggested to satisfy the observation part of his suggestion that his one or two trustees, that his favored inmates be placed either in the cell with the prisoner or right outside where they could watch him continually.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.131" offset="10347917">Now in those circumstances, if his instructions had been carried out and, incidentally, the chief jailer expressly agreed and indicated that he would carry out those instructions and suggestions, if they had been carried out, it would have been, I won’t say impossible for the man to commit suicide because it’s never-- you can try to say when a man is-- truly intends to commit suicide, that it would have been possible for him to do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2944.877" offset="11882872">I think what the Court of Appeals may have had in mind was that the-- to their view, the District Court was suggesting that the specific arrangements that Bowers neglected to make or failed to make would’ve required him personally to stand in the jail and watch the prisoner and I think, in essence, what they were saying was he had no duty to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.070" offset="11963643">But, as I said, I think that the judgment can be supported on the reason I’m urging even though they haven’t made it as explicit as I have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.724" offset="12026232">I think the-- to turn to the second point here which has to do with whether assuming the marshals themselves were not negligent, the United States is nonetheless liable for the torts of the jail’s employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.144" offset="12091956">In our view, the Federal Tort Claims Act forecloses that kind of derivative liability, and the government is liable because the government is liable under the Tort Claims Act only for the torts of federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.131" offset="12131871">The wisdom of that limitation is plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.118" offset="12139813">If the United States were held liable for the torts of the county jailers over whom the government can exercise no direct supervision, the government would face a potentially large financial burden and it would be unable to avoid it by its own conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.781" offset="12194461">There are approximately 800 of these contract jails in the country, housing any given day some-4,000 prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.437" offset="12225076">The United States has no authority to place a federal officer in each of these jails to supervise the physical conduct of the jail’s operations, and I don’t think the states would permit it even if they had the authority to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.318" offset="12272619">And even if there were such authority, the burden would be immense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3106.267" offset="12528410">This Court, as recently as last term in Melvin-- Laird against Nelms held that the requirement is of negligence of a government employee and it has to be of a government employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.771" offset="12574490">There’s no liability without fault in this case and that’s, in essence, what a-- under the statute and that’s, in essence, what a non-delegable duty amounts to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.588" offset="12625690">Even if a single federal employee could be stationed in each of these contract jails to ensure that federal prisoners are handled properly, it would be impossible, I think, for an officer who has no authority to hire, fire, discipline, or train the employees he was supervising to effectively deal with the problem and, in effect, the government would be what Mr. DeAnda said he was not urging and they would be namely ensured of the safety of the federal prisoners, and I don’t think that Congress intended that result under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3218.906" offset="12978970">That’s right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.861" offset="12994853">The Act itself provides for two possible grounds, under which the jail’s employees could conceivably be viewed as federal employees for purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.154" offset="13031946">One is that the jail is, in effect, a federal agency for purpose of dealing with federal prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.185" offset="13056084">That, it seems to me, is foreclosed by the provision Mr. Chief Justice Burger mentioned a little while ago that excludes contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.041" offset="13083564">It’s quite plain that this is a contractor that factions as an independent contractor over whose employees the federal government has no control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.334" offset="13116688">That is the standard under Texas law for whether a master-servant relationship exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.488" offset="13137272">Second, they argue or they have an argument that, nonetheless, the jail’s employees are in effect employees of the Bureau of Prisons which is, obviously, a federal agency under the provisions of the Act that provide for-- that define federal employees as those who act on behalf of the United States in official capacity, temporarily in the service of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.080" offset="13223685">But, in our view, that provision is only limited to those people who-- over whom the United States does have a right to control, and an example of the kind of provision-- the kind of situations it recover is where you have a dollar-a-year man serving without pay or where you have a loaned-servant from a state or where you have a member of a presidential commission himself, where all these people are under control of the government, but they’re not employees, so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.707" offset="13330160">Finally, I think I ought to address the point that Mr. Justice Blackmun alluded to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.783" offset="13350536">A holding in our favor in this case would not foreclose a remedy for people in Logue’s situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.844" offset="13374777">At the time of Logue’s death, there was a sovereign immunity that would protected the county and the state, but the sheriff was personally liable as in-- and is liable for the acts of his deputies, namely the county jailers, and it’s not an empty remedy because the sheriff is bonded in amounts between $5,000 and $30,000 under Texas state statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.443" offset="13457115">And, the decisions in Texas have held that the surety must pay for the-- for negligent acts of a sheriff’s deputy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.112" offset="13487835">So in addition to the state remedy, there is a possibility of a remedy under the Civil Rights Act, Section 1983 of Title 42, which provides that anyone who is injured by a state officer acting under color of state law, to deprive of the man of his federal rights will be liable to civil cause of action.</text>
