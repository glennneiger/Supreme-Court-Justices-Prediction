            <text syncTime="29.624" offset="221915">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.088" offset="235708">For purposes of this appeal, the facts are not really in dispute in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.144" offset="263920">What happened essentially is that on May 15, 1969, our clients, David Moor in one case and the plaintiff William Donovan Rundle, Jr. in the other case were shot by an Alameda County Deputy Sheriff in connection with the People’s Park disturbances in Berkeley.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.100" offset="339780">Subsequently, a suit was filed, actually two suits against the Deputy that shot our clients, his superior officers for their own acts and the County of Alameda.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.788" offset="390562">The concern here is only with that aspect of the case against the County of Alameda.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.019" offset="419401">What's involved here are three separate and distinct concepts of federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.994" offset="447300">The first is Civil Rights Acts jurisdiction, the second, pendent jurisdiction and the third, diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.814" offset="478647">The diversity jurisdiction issue relates only to the Moor case.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.703" offset="498186">It has no application whatsoever to the Rundle case.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.738" offset="514278">Of these three issues, we would submit that the clearest example of error by the Court below is in connection with its ruling on the diversity issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.943" offset="555133">For over 100 years, this Court, Courts of Appeals, District Courts and at least two District Courts within the Ninth Circuit have consistently held that political subdivisions of a state such as the County of Alameda are considered citizens of the state for diversity jurisdiction purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.671" offset="634023">For some unexplained reason, we have the rather anomalous result that with respect to California counties, they are presently not considered citizens of California for diversity jurisdiction purposes.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="146.703" offset="690134">Mr. Greenberg, is it your position that, that is a nationwide rule in effect that regardless of the relationship of a county to a particular state, it should be one rule throughout the country?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ronald_m_greenberg" startTime="158.001" stopTime="242.159">
            <label>Mr. Ronald M. Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="158.001" offset="735378">Barring at least a circumstance which would show that the state is in essence, the real party in interest in the case is correct and I can't think of a political subdivision such as a county in any state in the union where that would be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.171" offset="808103">Consistently, in every case we have researched on the point, it has always been that the county is separate and distinct from the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.993" offset="839346">Taking this case for example, anyone who is familiar with California Law and California politics would have to concede, that the state of California is not the real party in interest in this case, no liability is being sought against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.207" offset="896188">If we procure a judgment, it won't be liable for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.125" offset="907891">Indeed, it's not even a party and interest, let alone a real party in interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.329" offset="932655">So, for those reasons, I would urge on the Court that even if we are successful with respect to the Civil Rights Acts jurisdiction contention or the pendent jurisdiction aspect or both, that Court also reversed the diversity aspect jurisdiction holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.153" offset="1004022">I know for a fact that it has had serious effect for example, on out of state contractors, who wish to sue counties upon which, with which they contract in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.622" offset="1041847">As a result, of the holding in this Court, there is diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.928" offset="1055117">County is not a citizen and there is just no explanation given for that --</text>

            <text syncTime="242.159" offset="1072044">This was always kind of an off-hand casual way I gather, the Ninth Circuit originating with a brief opinion by the late District Judge Mathis that was accepted by the Ninth Circuit and then everything else was built on that?</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="258.874" offset="1138918">There are really only two opinions by the Ninth Circuit that even enunciate that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.536" offset="1157517">One is the Miller case which was a pro per case and then our case in which it was cited as authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.537" offset="1185520">I think, one could search both of those opinions in vain to find any reasoned analysis as to why in essence, the court feels that the state of California is somehow the real party in interest in our case and that's really what you have to conclude, to conclude it's a state agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="303.869" offset="1318849">I would say, two clear examples of the two District Courts within the Ninth Circuit who have refused to follow the Ninth Circuit holding, the Oregon case and the Arizona case, which at length analyzed the nature of the county and showed quite conclusively that it wasn't the state of Oregon or the state or Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.028" offset="1399515">There are other cases that are cited in our brief which also engage in this kind of analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.456" offset="1421145">Indeed, some of them say that's the kind of analysis you should make, when a claim is made, that the particular defendant is as in essence a state agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.495" offset="1453328">No such analysis was made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.180" offset="1460120">We have briefed at length in our brief all of the powers and functions of the County of Alameda that distinguish it from the state of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.341" offset="1496691">I think, both the county and the state would be surprised if they found that they were considered one and the same.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald M. Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="416.330" offset="1768678">They have long been held to be citizens of a state for diversity jurisdiction purposes and the most recent enunciation by the California Supreme Court has said that counties are quasi corporations of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.543" offset="1813504">Turning next to the Civil Rights Act's jurisdiction aspect of our appeal, I think, you have to take it step by step and the first question is, does Section 1983 allow for the doctrine of respondeat superior, that's the first basic question.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.629" offset="1885915">If one was to look at Hesselgesser versus Reilly, McDaniel v. Carroll, Lewis versus Brautigam, clearly, it seems that conceptually there is such allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.571" offset="1933667">An additional case which I would add which is not cited in our brief, but which specifically discusses this point is a case called Hill versus Toll, 320 F. Supp. 185, at pages 188 and 189 which involved Pennsylvania law.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.137" offset="1999914">And briefly the court there addressed itself specifically to the respondeat superior concept and said in essence as regards to this case, we note that the well settled doctrine of respondeat superior is not expressly abolished by Section 1983, nor does the legislative history make it clear that Congress intended the doctrine not to apply to Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.959" offset="2083192">Further, the salutary reason for the doctrine’s application, the Common Law Torts, i.e., the furnishing of a deep pocket from which a claimant can collect, argues just as forcefully for its application to the cause of action created by Section 1983 and conversely, we find that it is no wise less appropriate to apply respondeat superior to Section 1983 than to Common Law Torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.970" offset="2179218">Accordingly, we now decide consistent with the traditional injunction that remedial statutes are to receive a liberal construction that respondeat superior is impliedly a part of the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.495" offset="2233344">Now, once you accept that premise, you next look to the source of that vicarious liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.657" offset="2261974">We are not here arguing today, that the source of that liability is Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.462" offset="2285171">We are not here arguing that the source of that by vicarious liability is any other Civil Rights Act, Federal Law, rather we are saying the source of that vicarious liability is the California Tort Claims Act, State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.001" offset="2351417">Just as the source of the Sheriff's vicarious liability in Hesselgesser, the Sheriff and Sheriff Madigan (ph) vicarious liability in McDaniel and the Sheriff's vicarious liability in Lewis were State Law, no difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="589.328" offset="2460714">To my knowledge, no case has been cited to us and as result of the Tort Claims Act, the law says the county can sue and be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.566" offset="2501674">We presume that when it says the county can sue, it means, it can be a plaintiff, as well as, a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.263" offset="2528423">Specific authorization was given in 1963 by the California law for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.060" offset="2551620">Now turning then to the source of liability, two rather anomalous results would occur if the defendant’s position is adopted and they are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.964" offset="2603238">Up until 1963, the California law was that the sheriff was vicariously liable for the Torts committed by his deputy.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.514" offset="2637406">A case called Reynolds versus Lerman, 138 Cal. App. 2d 586 specifically held that.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.624" offset="2669902">When the Tort Claims Act was enacted in 1963, Section 820.8 was enacted which specifically says that one public employee cannot be vicariously liable for the acts of another public employee, rather it's the employing public entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.401" offset="2736985">Now, the whole policy of the Tort Claims Act was obviously to place ultimate financial responsibility where it could best be realized and to allow the party injured by a public employee opportunity for meaningful redress.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.370" offset="2808874">Yet, if we adopt the defendant’s position, where California sought to increase the likelihood, that a plaintiff might recover for the wrongs of their public employee, we would have the opposite effect in this case because we would say in essence that well, he could have sued the sheriff vicariously under cases such as we have discussed, somehow he can't sue the county.</text>

            <text syncTime="726.106" offset="3007822">Second, the logical result of the defendant’s position is simply not only, that a Federal Court cannot impose that state created liability, but because Congress did not intend for public entities to bear this ultimate liability that a state court can't even impose it and indeed, a state can't pass such a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.443" offset="3093191">And yet, I cannot imagine that the defendants are here even taking the position that California as a matter of its law doesn't have authority, power or what have you to pass a law saying that its public entities will be vicariously liable for the torts of their employees, including Civil Rights Act's violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.721" offset="3178245">That's a state law determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.301" offset="3188590">That's is a state policy determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.620" offset="3197889">And the only next question then becomes, can a Federal Court also impose that state created liability?</text>
            <text syncTime="782.245" offset="3232371">To that, we look to 1988 and Section 1343.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.196" offset="3252120">Now, 1988 is not a jurisdictional section.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.914" offset="3267062">It doesn't create any cause of action, it doesn't confer any jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.432" offset="3285138">Title 28, 1343 confers jurisdiction on the Federal Courts to enforce and in the words that I believe, any act of Congress which is provided for the protection of Civil Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.477" offset="3337279">Looking at Section 1988, if it's not an act of Congress, I don't know what it is and if it wasn't designed for the protection of Civil Rights, I don't know what it was passed for.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.719" offset="3378239">It clearly falls within that language and thus there is no violation to Monroe, to 1983 or to any other Civil Rights Act provision by saying that the Federal Court can utilize 1988 in the fashion it was intended and have jurisdiction to impose that state created liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.487" offset="3477295">This then brings me to the final jurisdictional contention we make, and which is perhaps the most difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.073" offset="3515643">That is, if we assume arguendo that by some quirk 1988 doesn't mean what it says, that the California Tort Claims Act cannot impose this vicarious liability, but can at the same time impose vicarious liability for the state battery or state negligence, wrongs committed by the public employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.675" offset="3614072">Can the county be joined as a pendent party on the pendent state claims that are otherwise before the court?</text>
            <text syncTime="887.235" offset="3652315">Now, in a sense, we have something like and Astor-Honor type analysis because you do have a Federal Statute which can be construed along with pendent jurisdiction really to bring about the result of joining the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.276" offset="3720443">But taking it just in the abstract for the moment, we're concerned here with the concept of judicial power, not discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.567" offset="3757641">There is no opinion from this Court that we are aware of that has precisely discussed the joinder of a pendent party.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.919" offset="3787003">The trend since Gibbs has been certainly that pendent jurisdiction can be utilized, that the considerations and policy which led to its liberalization and were further liberalized in Rosado, and that if the criteria otherwise available for pendent jurisdiction, there was at least the power to join a pendent -- perhaps a pendent party.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.613" offset="3897866">Now, in the Courts of Appeals, the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth and Eight Circuit Courts of Appeals have expressly recognized this judicial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.909" offset="3946977">The Sixth Circuit by implication has recognized this power, yet the Ninth Circuit stands alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.412" offset="3981040">It is the only circuit to our knowledge which expressly holds that pendent jurisdiction does not allow for the joinder of parties, only claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.493" offset="4041331">Taking this case for the moment, if we look to the traditional test, does the claim arise out of the nucleus of operative fact, clearly, there isn't even an additional fact involved with respect to the county’s liability because it's vicarious and the dependent solely upon that liability of the individuals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1456.963" offset="5931238">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.946" offset="5947120">I think the analysis of this issue must first start with plaintiff’s concessions which are that he has not and cannot state a cause of action against the County of Alameda under any Federal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.003" offset="5999365">He is only asking this Court to have a Federal Court, here state law, California causes of action against the County of Alameda and he is asking the Court for an expansion of Federal jurisdiction in three regards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.637" offset="6061955">He is asking the Court to incorporate an entire body of California law through 1988 and then pretend that that's an act of Congress within the meaning of Section 1343.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.389" offset="6112946">He is asking the Court to expand the concept of pendent jurisdiction to bring in a party defendant not otherwise before the Court, against whom no federal cause of action has been stated, just because there was a related cause of action in the court against other parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.280" offset="6184521">And third in the Moor case only, he is stating that there is diversity jurisdiction because the County of Alameda is a “citizen” within the meaning of diversity jurisdiction Section 1332.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.823" offset="6242617">Taking the 1988 argument first which is the most difficult one, I think that there are at least three major objections to bringing in a state body of law under that Section for the purpose of giving the federal court jurisdiction of the state law cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.222" offset="6308237">First from the language of the Section itself and from the report of decisions, it does not appear that Section 1988 was intended to create a cause of action, in fact plaintiff concedes this, or intended to confer a jurisdiction or intended to do anymore really than provide supplementary damage remedies to the district court on a cause of action, a case over which it already has jurisdiction against the party over which it already has jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.470" offset="6417220">And the language of the Section, it says in itself, that the statutes of the state were in the court having jurisdiction of such civil or criminal causes held shall be extended to and govern said course in the trial and disposition of the cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.468" offset="6489213">We submit that Section 1988 should not be used to wholesale incorporate state law causes of action for torts of any kind or by vicarious responsibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="1648.982" offset="6699342">I am saying that 1343 requires an Act of Congress and that's the jurisdictional statute and using 1988 to incorporate an entire body of state laws, is not an act of Congress, it's an act of the state legislature.</text>

            <text syncTime="1661.956" offset="6751169">And in addition to that, plaintiff has not met at all the arguments that you cannot use 1983 simply by its own terms where there is an adequate remedy, the Federal remedy is adequate and you cannot use it to bring in an inconsistent state law and both of those considerations are present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.973" offset="6823267">As has been pointed in our brief and as pointed out by petitioner in his brief, what California did in this case, instead of providing for the direct liability of public entities in this type of situation in 1983 suit, they said that, where the employee requested, the county must defend and indemnify the employee under government code sections 825 and 895.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.430" offset="6909053">In other words, it's an indirect assumption to get at this principle of deep pocket, if you will, or provide a responsible defendant and that has been done in this case, as alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.514" offset="6945416">The county is conducting the defense of all the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.636" offset="6957955">Furthermore, it's also pointed out the employees have their own insurance of $200,000 or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.861" offset="6978853">Now, the argument raised here has been that the employees are judgment proof and I submit that the petitioners have been less candid with the Court in making that kind of an insertion because it's quite obvious that the individual defendants are not judgment proof in any sense of the word and plaintiff’s remedy is perfectly adequate under section 1983, 1985, 1986 against the five individual defendants and that precludes application of State Law under section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.665" offset="7106017">Furthermore, it has been held in Monroe, the legislature when it passed the 1871 Act intended to exclude public entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.882" offset="7154918">Now, the argument is made here that well, if the 1871 Congress were transported to the 21 century or the 20th century and in light of the fact that some municipalities and states have conditionally waved sovereign immunity, they would have intended something different or pass a different act but that's not the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.106" offset="7223777">As was held in Ries versus Lynskey, what we are looking at is what they intended at that time and they intended at that time to exclude public entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.445" offset="7253138">There motive in doing so is not relevant to statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.311" offset="7268603">And you get points very clearly established in Monroe and I think it's binding here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.327" offset="7288665">To bring in then the public entity through 1988 is interrogation of the in derogation of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.804" offset="7310608">It's clearly against what Congress said they wanted to do at that time, that is exclude public entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.022" offset="7351463">And for that reason also, then 1988 could not be used to incorporate this body of state law and I would refer the court also to the brief of the District of Columbia in a related case of District of Columbia versus Carter which is recently reversed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.092" offset="7415724">We discussed in some length the motives of the Congress and there are several references there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.421" offset="7437040">I did not brief this at length because it was in his brief and I didn't want to duplicate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.210" offset="7460237">Finally, I would point that Monroe has been on the books for something like 12 years now and in the interim, Congress has enacted several major civil right legislations and has not changed to rule and they have been asked to do so and I think that is indicative of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.171" offset="7520005">I don't think this Court should now try and change the rules of municipal liability in civil right actions, if Congress wants to do so and that's up to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.864" offset="7570787">Alright second -- as to the issue of -- well, I should point that one other thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.963" offset="7595238">There really isn't reason to make this kind of a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.165" offset="7612061">Plaintiff not only has a remedy in State Court, he has acted on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.600" offset="7629824">There is a case pending in the State Court with the identical issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="2226.076" offset="9007626">If I may though, Mr. Justice White read, the issue relevant to the present study of course is whether public entities not withstanding their immunity from direct liability under the Civil Rights Act should assume financial responsibility (whether through payment of insurance premiums to protect their personnel or through assumption of payments of judgments against such personnel) for violations by their police officers of that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.944" offset="9107101">By analogy the suggestions offered earlier I just believe that considerations should be given to adoption of statutory procedures under which entities in California would be required to resume -- to assume ultimate financial responsibility for such torts to their police officers and as precisely what they did under Section 825 and 895.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.950" offset="9175124">Now plaintiff says, they did not specifically exclude 1983 actions, which you have to recall and this is the wake of Monroe versus Pape and as they discussed there, the legislature knew they were already excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.670" offset="9226010">There wasn't any reason to make a super or an extra exclusion for that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.524" offset="9241475">And what did they do is provide through 825 and 895 to defend and indemnify in such actions instead of having the public entity a direct defendant in the Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.113" offset="9339800">There is also the point present here that putting the action -- putting the public entity directly into a Federal 1983 action would seriously complicate the jury instructions, I believe, that would be present in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.110" offset="9411793">As I pointed out in our brief, there are large number of defenses and immunities that are applicable under the California action which then would become present in the federal case as to the entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.374" offset="9456828">Now petitioner properly points out that under the pendent jurisdiction claims against the employee, some but not all of these defenses would be present anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.715" offset="9494235">It seems to me that you are going to have a situation where you are going to tell a jury that as to the federal causes of action, you have these three defenses applicable and as to the state law causes of action, you have these 4 - 5 others applicable, as to the employees, but as to the public entity, you have six others applicable whether it's a state law or federal law cause of action and then you are going to tell the jury that the public entity can only be held liable vicariously through the state and the jury is going to say, what are you trying to say?</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.915" offset="9615026">It's a ridiculous situation and it's an unnecessary situation to overly complicate the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.400" offset="9636968">I feel that given -- a jury given that kind of instructions cannot possibly follow the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2783.829" offset="11238693">Now as against the state, the county has no powers whatsoever, as has been made clear in the cases cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.041" offset="11267532">In other words, if the state wants to take property away from a county, they just simply do it, no compensation, nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.539" offset="11297520">As to third parties, the county stands in the shoes of the state and that's also in the cases that for example, in the one case mentioned, the county took some action which should properly have been taken by the state and the court said, no, the county is simply an agent of state, stands in the state shoes and is perfectly capable of taking this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.137" offset="11371917">Now when you are talking about citizenship, which is what we are talking about under 1332 and I would oppose that to the concept of state as in the Eleventh Amendment, I think this is something different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.435" offset="11417161">I fail to see how you can say that a county is a citizen of the state under those circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="3131.624" offset="12629870">I don't see how that can really be a distinction between whether you are citizen or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.683" offset="12646066">In fact, all of the rights that are talked about here are state rights that are delegated to the county.</text>

            <text syncTime="3154.229" offset="12720253">On the pendent point then, I feel that there is a major difference between joining causes of action among a defendant already subject to federal jurisdiction and between bringing in the defendant into the Federal Court on a state law cause of action when there is no congressional or constitutional authority to bring that particular defendant in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.736" offset="12862360">I can readily appreciate the reasoning in Gibbs which is judicial economy and expediency, but I think that one of the very few checks on the federal judiciary today is the power of Congress to define jurisdictional limits of the District Court and I would respectfully suggest that this Court should go slow in extending on your own the concept of jurisdiction to include another party not previously in front of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.459" offset="12981164">I think that there is also merit to Mr. Shakman’s argument in 20 Stanford Law Review that state questions should be left to the state courts in many cases and I think in this particular case, Chief Justice Burger brought up to this questionnaire immunity point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.033" offset="13043545">There is a point of Section of 820.4, of the Government Code which says there is no liability to a public employee in exercising due care in the enforcement of law except for false arrest or false imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.783" offset="13094536">I think that these are questions, are difficult questions that should be left to the state courts and not to the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.635" offset="13117942">As Mr. Shakman points out if the state court makes an error, this Court can review it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.696" offset="13134137">If the Federal Court makes an error, the state has absolutely no opportunity to review that or to correct the error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.971" offset="13159215">Well, I think there are some very good reasons why it should not be extended in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.365" offset="13180844">But basically, I think we are talking about a separation of power problem and I think that you are going to have to draw the line in some place on what kinds of claims can be brought in the Federal Court when there is no congressional authority for that and I would draw the line here when you are talking about bringing in another party who is not already in front of the court and that's the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.385" offset="13260884">I think the Ninth Circuit was correct in these points and I would like to suggest that their action should be affirmed.</text>
