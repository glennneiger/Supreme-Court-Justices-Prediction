            <text syncTime="47.463" offset="293177">Mr. Chief Justice, if it pleases this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.442" offset="317106">This marine ship collision case occurred on Christmas Eve in 1967, 24th of December 1967 at about 8:30 p.m. on the Columbia River, which flows as you know between the States of Oregon and Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.380" offset="412923">My client, Union Oil Company was the bareboat charter of the tanker Santa Maria.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.932" offset="443120">Santa Maria was approximately 550 feet long and she had a gross ton each of about 11,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.808" offset="486588">She was loaded with 17,000 gallons of petroleum products and was inbound from the Pacific Coast Ocean to Portland, Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.635" offset="529951">She's an American flag vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.244" offset="540400">At Astoria, Oregon, she took aboard a Columbia River pilot, Mr. McDonald Caples who has been going to see on the Columbia River, a tugboat man and so forth since 1928.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.079" offset="611662">This was his 3550th ship as a pilot on the Columbia River.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.595" offset="645726">He had also piloted the Santa Maria he testified about 11 to 12 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.922" offset="675088">He proceeded inbound from Astoria to Portland.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.798" offset="698598">This is a winding course that takes a number of hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.006" offset="715421">Some fog was experienced near the town or the inlet of Skamokawa, which is on the Washington side of the Columbia River pretty close to its mouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.368" offset="760874">The chief mate of the vessel was Mr. Aspland and he testified that you always find a little fog at Skamokawa at that time of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.157" offset="807999">The vessel proceeded on mainly on a full bell but from maneuvering speed in the river, which is about 11 to 12 knots and there was a vessel that was inbound called the Teak Wood under the command of Captain (Inaudible) who was also a Columbia River pilot.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.612" offset="889814">The pilots at that time were communicating with one another by a walkie-talkie machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.602" offset="917817">And they just converse about the traffic on the river and the conditions and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.196" offset="944149">And Captain Caples through this walkie-talkie communication was aware that there was a tug and barge bound downstream on the Columbia River from Rainier, Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.225" offset="1000260">Now this time, it was the San Jacinto.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth E. Roberts</label>
            <text syncTime="231.014" offset="1027427">Just about a knot I think, according to the -- and downstream as I recollect from the evidence, with very little current.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.931" offset="1051146">I don't think it had really any significance as far as the collision was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.498" offset="1073403">The San Jacinto was owned and operated by Star &amp; Crescent, had a completely inexperienced crew aboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.661" offset="1109974">The -- not that the man had any papers or such.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.272" offset="1128469">The master I think, it was either his first or second trip.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.219" offset="1148217">And towing and towed by the San Jacinto was this big barge called the Oliver J. Olson 3, which was fully loaded with lumber above the deck about two or three tiers high at which -- and the lumber had been loaded at Rainier.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.863" offset="1222823">Now, the tugboat was towing on a 250-foot cable.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.983" offset="1251349">The barge I think was about 300 -- 250 to 300 feet in length.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.838" offset="1278725">Now, downstream at the same time or about this time was Captain Olson, another Columbia River pilot, who was piloting a Pacific Telstar.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.820" offset="1326686">He was also in communication with Captain Caples on the Santa Maria by the walkie-talkie and he advised that he had passed the tug and barge.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.861" offset="1378826">He also advised there was a little, what they call toolie fog on the Columbia River at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.131" offset="1403904">Now this is a fog that kind of hangs down toward the water and it was mainly on the Washington side, it was patchy.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.294" offset="1440580">The pilots all had testified it hadn't impeded the traffic on the river as demonstrated by the evidence in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.456" offset="1473181">And that it was to be expected at this time of the year and the toolie fog, I think the best way to describe it, if you've got a fairly large vessel, you probably could see the top of the mast, but you couldn't see the hull and it was all -- all patchy parts of it were all over on the Washington side of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.319" offset="1544652">Now, I think it is important to visualize the scene of this particular casualty.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.137" offset="1587911">This is a narrow channel and one of the exhibits which were introduced into the evidence shows the channel itself and this is just a blowup of the coast in Geodetic Survey chart.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.082" offset="1639737">And the accident occurred right here at buoy number 70.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.575" offset="1657710">The bridge channel right at the scene of the collision is 500 feet wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.253" offset="1688430">The actual river at this point which is maneuverable at least as far as big vessels are concerned or vessels with a large draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.567" offset="1725628">And by the way, the Santa Maria was drawing 31 feet at the stern.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.550" offset="1749556">It is about 800 feet wide although going from the Oregon to the Washington shore or ever to Wallace Island is about 1500 feet but of that amount, there is over 800 feet that's ashore just to the north side there of Wallace Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.944" offset="1827192">Now, there is no doubt in my opinion that the evidence clearly demonstrates that the pilots all know about the tug and barge.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.831" offset="1862719">Captain Caples had seen her visually and he had seen her on radar.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.333" offset="1888737">The other pilots had seen the tug and barge visually and on radar.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.477" offset="1913292">Now, at or about this Cooper Point and water for the area, which are two lights on the Washington side of the river, there was some of this toolie fog and it was a patch.</text>

            <text syncTime="478.036" offset="2015483">The tugboat was navigating by following the trees on the bank of the Washington side of the river and you will note from the exhibit in the chart that I have shown that the river turns a little and the pilots navigate on range lights and on courses at this particular point in the entire length of the Columbia River.</text>

            <text syncTime="519.023" offset="2179427">It's not unusual for the Columbia River.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.895" offset="2186951">In fact, they'd had a lot of bigger vessels and a number of tankers come in on a periodic business all the time from the refineries in the California area and Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.331" offset="2224671">So it's not an unusual vessel by any means.</text>

            <text syncTime="627.975" offset="2615254">Under these circumstances, the -- I think to be perfectly honest and frank about it, the record would indicate that at this draft at 31 feet and fully loaded, the vessel would be what they call smelling the bottom and it's pretty hard for it to steer at a low rate of speed.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.842" offset="2690696">And so my position is that seven to eight under these circumstances was more than justified and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.664" offset="2718072">Now, there is evidence in the record to the effect that once you're on slow speed and are continuing for any length of time, you do maintain steerageway but I don't think it was in relation to a vessel in these inland borders and secondly, I do not believe that that took into consideration the fact that -- that pilot was changing courses all the time coming up the Columbia River.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.719" offset="2818278">And therefore, when he was changing course, it was necessary that he'd be on half ahead rather than slow ahead.</text>

            <text syncTime="765.151" offset="3163930">I will clear up the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.556" offset="3169573">The publications indicate that dredge depth for the channel was from 35 to 40 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.330" offset="3188694">The army engineers like to maintain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.908" offset="3203009">The issues before this Court arise out of the fact that the trial judge found the tug and barge solely at fault for this collision and said that the evidence was overwhelming to support such as a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.543" offset="3253582">The case was appealed by the tug and barge to the Ninth Circuit on one ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.306" offset="3272600">And that was that at the time the barge going -- probably, the Santa Maria going at about seven knots constituted a violation of the speed in fog rule which is Rule 16 which requires a vessel to go at a moderate speed when travelling in fog, or rain and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.303" offset="3368626">The Ninth Circuit under the ruling in the Silver Palm, a Ninth Circuit decision, interprets the word moderate speed in fog to mean that a vessel apparently must stop within a half the distance that you can see ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.086" offset="3435708">And in this case, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that the distance was probably about 900 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.768" offset="3462457">Although, I don't think there is any evidence in the record to substantiate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.821" offset="3478653">And therefore, the tugboat -- the barge, pardon me, the Santa Maria should have stopped within 450 feet and of course this is impossible at the speed of seven knots that it was travelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.307" offset="3528600">We take the position on this appeal that this is in conflict with other Circuit decisions, the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth and in particular, where the Fifth Circuit's decision in the Hess Voyager where that rule, Article 16, moderate speed was interpreted to mean, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the location of the collision and the circumstances leading to the collision itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.662" offset="3658062">In this case, we feel that the evidence justifies an adoption of the rule of the majority of the Circuits that moderate speed cannot be interpreted to mean half the distance ahead but that the trier of the facts must determine based on all of the circumstances then prevailing as to whether a vessel was or was not going at moderate speed so to come within Rule 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.310" offset="3772583">In this case, we feel the evidence very clearly showed that in determining that the vessel was going at moderate speed, the trial judge in effect found that there was no probability at all of the tug and barge crossing this narrow channel and making a U-turn in the channel itself and that the Santa Maria was on her own extreme side of the channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.699" offset="3866206">The fog was patchy, it was a toolie type fog, it wasn't fog all the time on the voyage and other vessels were navigating the Columbia River at that particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.998" offset="3911346">The vessel was in charge of a very, very experienced Columbia River pilot who had knowledge of the river, intimate knowledge of the river and other pilots had indicated at the time that the fog conditions were such that it didn't prevent the vessels navigating the Columbia River.</text>

            <text syncTime="1089.762" offset="4462425">And I really believe that the decisions of the other circuits where they take into consideration all of the circumstances in determining a -- a reasonable or moderate speed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.583" offset="4513729">Judge Wright in the Ninth Circuit just went on speed alone in reversing and holding mutual fault in this case and the -- the history of the Rule 16 and the -- why it has been interpreted by other circuits is to the effect that you cannot just say such and such a speed is not moderate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.981" offset="4595336">You've got to take into consideration all of the circumstances prevailing at or at the -- at or at the time of the collision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1145.474" offset="4685302">Did they run from the edge of the fog bank or from immediately ahead of the vessel?</text>

            <text syncTime="1152.115" offset="4711842">I feel and under these circumstances the master is put into a straightjacket.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.007" offset="4731382">The pilot under these circumstances he'd have no alternative.</text>

            <text syncTime="1164.577" offset="4761684">As soon as he sees anything like fog or reduced visibility, he must anchor the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.919" offset="4783000">And I don't think that this is a reasonable inference to be taken from that particular language in Rule 16.</text>

            <text syncTime="2808.467" offset="11337226">I'm not an expert on ballistics but her momentum, but it seems to me there's something about weight times speed and so forth and I think it goes up pretty rapidly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.409" offset="11381008">I think at five knots, you can come to a slower speed or a reduced speed a lot quicker than you can at seven or eight knots.</text>

            <text syncTime="2883.512" offset="11637426">Yes, Mr. Justice Powell, I think that's perhaps another way of stating the Pennsylvania Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.735" offset="11662294">When she violates the rule of sight, she is considered to have committed the statutory violation which puts on her the burden of proving not only that this violation didn't cause the accident but couldn't have caused it and therefore, if she fails to prove that, she's held condemned on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.041" offset="11731571">I think it's just another way of stating the Pennsylvania Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.460" offset="11741184">In other words, it's a presumption that she has caused the -- contributed to the collision and in this case, she didn't put on any evidence to it that the collision still would have occurred and really couldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.674" offset="11806072">I think this -- I just merely want to say that we have no conflict here with the fact that you consider the circumstances because of course when you're determining whether your speed is -- you can stop in half a distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.305" offset="11876603">All of the circumstances come into play whether you're fully loaded and have more momentum because of your weight or whether you're light, whether you have a headwind, whether you've got quick reversing engines or slower reversing engines, whether you've got a headwind or a tailwind, everything -- all those circumstances come into play and it doesn't take any slide rule of calculation as my Brother would say anymore than when you're driving a car down a highway in a thick fog, it's probably a pretty prudent thing to do to not go at such speed that you can't stop within the rule of sight because there might be a broken down automobile in the middle of road ahead on you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.577" offset="12033651">Now when you're driving down the highway in a dense fog is probably a pretty good thing to not exceed the speed that you can see ahead in the fog, at least I normally, if I'm not to go or in that at least to which I can see lights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.329" offset="12088717">So, I think it's a rule of common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.671" offset="12102092">I think the Court of Appeals' decision on this point when read carefully is probably the best brief that one could write for upholding the rule of sight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.220" offset="12140231">This brings me the point of damages and division of damages and I would less likely -- I'll very briefly sketch the history on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.592" offset="12177742">Some 120 years ago, of course this Court announced that in mutual fault cases damages are divided equally and that is continued to be the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.096" offset="12215777">The same rule was applied in England for years and years and years and then it was actually made statutory, this I do not have all this in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.037" offset="12259558">I didn't put in the brief but the English -- I can't say it -- act of some 1873, the 50/50 rule is made statutory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.134" offset="12311907">Then in 1910, we had the Brussels Convention which adapted proportional fault but also did a lot of other things and governed the relations with cargo, the obligations toward cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.323" offset="12356629">Now, we come with the legislative history in the United States and Brussels Convention was submitted to the Senate in 1937 and it sat here for 10 years and there wasn't much action during the war but it remained here after the war but after a 10-year period when no action was taken -- taken on it, it was withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.407" offset="12445027">Then in 1962 in the 87th Congress, they put in a Senate Bill 2313 and H.R. in the House 7911 and those finally died on the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.899" offset="12514931">They were reported on a committee but they died on the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.307" offset="12532590">Then the next year in 1963, I do not include this in my brief unfortunately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.863" offset="12562787">I didn't have all the legislative history research facilities in Portland and I check this out with the Congressional Library here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.697" offset="12594134">But in the 88th Congress, again two bills were introduced, S.555 and H.R. 1070 but those bills again were to provide for proportional fault and to really enact the substance of Brussels and they never got out of committee, never got out of subcommittee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.514" offset="12689429">Now, so much for the past history, this Court although was a personal injury case that reiterated in Halcyon, the rule that the collision cases that's 50/50 and as recently as 1963 in Weyerhaeuser versus United States, a unanimous decision opinion written by Mr. Justice Potter again, referred to the rule that we have here a rule which is work with the -- I don't want to miss quote it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.201" offset="12828191">It's in my brief but anyway, recondition was paid to the rule in 1963 that in collision case, it's always 50/50.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.304" offset="12856613">Now, briefly on the merits of this rule versus proportional fault, it -- contrary to what my colleague says, I'm sure that it promotes settlements.</text>

            <text syncTime="3211.361" offset="12948773">I think experienced lawyers sitting across the table will recognize -- well, there were some fault here and there are some fault there and we settle 50/50.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.580" offset="13001644">In my own experience of 30 years, I have never tried a major -- you know a big half million, million or two million dollar collision case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.284" offset="13036544">I settled many of them and I don't know one in which I didn't say, “Your ship was a lot more at fault than ours,” and the other fellow was saying, “Your ship was a lot more at fault.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.115" offset="13075832">But when you get all through arguing, you have to admit that there was some fault on both sides and you settle at 50/50.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.795" offset="13098506">Now, the Andrea Doria, Stockholm which was probably one of the major collisions with most money involved never -- I don't believe it was ever tried in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.623" offset="13145840">It was an ultimate settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.166" offset="13152005">These cases have uniformly been settled and it's a pretty practical rule because as my colleague's brief points out, you've got mostly whole insurance companies on both sides of these things and maybe they lose a little here but they evens up with the next case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.917" offset="13207071">Maybe in one case, they thought they should have come two thirds, one-third but next case is the other way and they're all settled 50/50.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.985" offset="13235284">Now, for just for a moment on the burden that this might place on the courts, not only do I think that if you have a proportional fault rule, each side is going to say, “Your ship is more at fault.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.200" offset="13284185">“No, yours is more at fault,” that you're going to litigate but you're going make the trials much longer because it's going to get to be a game of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.490" offset="13321383">Now, if I can just prove that you violated the rule of sight, you were going too fast in fog, that's all I have to prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.408" offset="13353044">But if we get to proportional fault, I want to prove that he was not keeping a proper look out on the bow, that he wasn't lowering his danger signals, he wasn't lowering his fog signals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.433" offset="13397138">They turn port when it should have gone starboard.</text>

            <text syncTime="3371.979" offset="13591280">Remember that Brussels Convention also regulates the obligations toward cargo, and this is very important to this case to understand the ship owner's obligations toward cargo because every major collision case or almost everyone, you have inextricably involved with the cross liabilities between two ship owners.</text>

            <text syncTime="3459.224" offset="13940276">I believe not, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.022" offset="13951457">The first that I have found that it was presented was 1937 which all it was originally adapted 1910 but I think it -- we have to allow 25 years in order to be adapted by a lot of the other maritime nations and then when they got to be pretty uniformly adapted by the other maritime nations, they made to push to have it done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.857" offset="14030764">They never took hold of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.074" offset="14039646">Now, I want to explain this matter of cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.332" offset="14052707">You see the cargo on the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.996" offset="14079352">It's important to distinguish between the carrying vessel which carries the cargo and a non-carrying vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.948" offset="14111117">For many years under Acts of Congress, the Harter Act, Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, we call it COGSA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.920" offset="14139016">Cargo has not right to recover against its own ship, the carrying ship, for negligent navigation which is involved in collisions but cargo has always had the right to recover a 100% against the non-carrying vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.624" offset="14201919">Now -- so that's what happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.891" offset="14214980">Cargo gets 100% of its recovery against the non-carrying vessel and under the 50/50 rule a non-carrying vessel then includes its payment to cargo in its damages and gets them back from the -- and gets 50% back from the carrying vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.448" offset="14273181">So indirectly, the carrying vessel ends up paying 50% of the damage to its own cargo but no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.938" offset="14315081">They used to try to devise bill of lading clauses to get around that but in the United States against the Atlantic Mutual, this Court held those bill of lading clauses void as against public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.398" offset="14368998">So the law is well settled that the innocent cargo recovers a 100% against the non-carrying vessel which in turn gets 50% back from the carrying vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.872" offset="14410898">But now, if you were to adapt piecemeal, an extract out of Brussels Convention, a rule of proportional fault, look at the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.536" offset="14461471">He would create innocent cargo on the carrying vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.075" offset="14483623">And let's assume the carrying vessel is 90% to blame and non-carrying vessel is 10%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.857" offset="14506820">The innocent cargo gets a 100% of its damages against that 10% to blame non-carrying ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.532" offset="14537540">That ship in turn, under proportional fault, we get 90% of the damages back from the carrying vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.963" offset="14571186">So you have the carrying vessel which Congress under Harter Act in COGSA says it's not responsible for damage to the cargo due to negligent navigation as being indirectly held for 90% of the damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.148" offset="14635969">Now this does two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.018" offset="14643493">Number one, it pushes us a lot further away from the law of other nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.378" offset="14668884">If is -- If we're trying to achieve uniformity, let's try to get some uniformity on maritime law with England and Japan and Italy and Germany.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.980" offset="14707336">But here, we'd be pushing to think further from uniformity because here you create situations where cargo would end up with a 90% recovery from its own vessel and under the law of all other maritime nations, cargo cannot recover from its own vessel and its recovery against the non-carrying ship is not a 100% but it is such percentage is that non-carrying vessel is at fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.863" offset="14834813">Not only the -- create habit with uniformity but you open the door at least you create an atmosphere where -- which is an invitation to collision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.698" offset="14882147">A ship carrying a valuable cargo, we say a million dollars of cargo damage and maybe there's only 100,000 scattered damage to the wholes of the two ships, like she is going to come, if she is pretty much to blame, she is going to come in and try to admit sole blame and say, “I'm 100% at fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.689" offset="14966157">That other ship was free and clear,” and shape a witness's testimony that way because if she is a 100% to blame, she doesn't have to pay any cargo damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.758" offset="15002415">The cargo can't recover against the other ship -- excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.720" offset="15022268">Yeah, if she is a 100 -- if a carrying vessel is a 100% to blame that presupposes that the non-carrying vessel has no fault so cargo gets nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.785" offset="15062497">And so, with the million dollar cargo damage and ships, maybe 100,000 whole of damage, why -- the ship is going to throw the case if it can do so gracefully and escape that million dollar liability even though it might pick up the $100,000 tab.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.164" offset="15143999">I think it opens the door to collision that leads to ridiculous results as far as the forum shopping.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.583" offset="15173674">I'd never seen any great -- amount of forum shopping on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.286" offset="15188511">I don't think it exists and when the collisions are on -- in the waters, of course they're controlled by the law of the place and forum shopping doesn't do you any good.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.744" offset="15226337">I submit that the rule shouldn't conclude by saying that the rule is a workable rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.644" offset="15257997">We've had it for 100 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.877" offset="15266879">We don't have the reason for change here that you had in (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.853" offset="15282761">In (Inaudible), that involving death on inland waters, we had utter chaos in the maritime field and substantive right of recovery for death because you relegated the suitor to the state death statute which varied from state to state, in some places there was a bar in other places which proportionately -- in all kinds of nonuniform results.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.458" offset="15385161">We don't have the reason for trying to make new law or changing the law that you had in (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.640" offset="15413896">And in view of the legislative history, I think this thing should be straightened up by Congress and I agree with -- I believe it was Mr. Justice Rehnquist's absence of briefs amicus here and the absence of any recent efforts in Congress shows that everybody is pretty well satisfied with this 50/50 rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3845.707" offset="15486203">It's a good work for a rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3854.500" offset="15521416">I just have a couple of remarks, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.128" offset="15531865">Under the comparative fault doctrine, Mr. Wood has already said that under the mutual fault doctrine, the non-carrying vessel puts up if it's 10% of fault now it still gets 50% back from the carrying vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3873.002" offset="15595395">It seems to me that if it gets 90% back from the carrying vessel based on comparative fault that is more equitable and just under all of the circumstances and I can't see any difference or validity to his argument between the 50% which he gets back now and the 90% which he'd get back on if this Court has decided to -- to adapt the comparative fault rule.</text>
