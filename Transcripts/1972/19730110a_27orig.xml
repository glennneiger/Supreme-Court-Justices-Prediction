            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We’ll hear arguments next in number 27 original, the State of Ohio against the State of Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.611" offset="213765">Mr. Howard, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph M. Howard</label>
            <text syncTime="30.533" offset="225468">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.711" offset="250232">This is an action by the State of Ohio requesting a determination of the location of its boundary with Kentucky in the Ohio River.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.861" offset="310836">The only question presently before the Court is whether or not Ohio shall be permitted to amend its original complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.695" offset="358170">That original complaint was filed back in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.425" offset="385024">At that time, Ohio claimed that the boundary existed at the low water mark on the north side of the river, that is on the Ohio side, as it stood in 1792, which was the day at which Kentucky became a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.764" offset="486379">Kentucky filed an answer and it claimed that the boundary lay at the present low water mark on the north side of the river on the Ohio side.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.763" offset="546461">That, of course, was much farther up on the Ohio shore than the old 1792 line, because of the new dams which have been put in on the Ohio River beginning in back in 1890, the planning began.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.107" offset="631829">The dams were erected.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.314" offset="652622">I think the first set of them were completed in 1925, and then in the 50’s a new set of high level dams began to be erected by the Army Corps of Engineers, and that caused a much higher level of the water and further inundation on the Ohio side.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.884" offset="762859">Well, the issues were joined on the original complaint in the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.961" offset="787205">And this Court appointed the Master and there were quite a number of conferences between the Master and counsel as to how the case should be conducted and the evidence presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.769" offset="850422">There were a great number of conferences apparently between counsels on both sides determining just what the evidence would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.781" offset="894516">And in July 1970, Ohio made an offer of settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.541" offset="929520">As I recall, it was 250 feet up into the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.327" offset="952717">I may be mistaken on the exact figures on that but that was --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="216.358" offset="968808">That was somewhere between the 1792 line and the present line on the north shore?</text>

            <text syncTime="223.233" offset="996289">I would guess it would have been above the 1792 line.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.251" offset="1016351">That’s my guess.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="229.111" offset="1019800">The issue originally in this lawsuit was whether or not the low water mark on the north shore was that of 1792 or that of today.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_m_howard" startTime="238.348" stopTime="240.186">
            <label>Mr. Joseph M. Howard</label>
            <text syncTime="238.348" offset="1056789">That’s right; that's right.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="240.186" offset="1064103">And I suppose therefore, I would guess, I will assume that a settlement would fix the line somewhere in between those two?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_m_howard" startTime="246.010" stopTime="681.052">
            <label>Mr. Joseph M. Howard</label>
            <text syncTime="246.010" offset="1087404">Well, I have not gotten into that part of it yet at all, and I can’t say; I’m guessing that it was closer to what Ohio wanted than what Kentucky felt Ohio should get.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.523" offset="1157413">Apparently, from what I can gather from the Master’s comments and from what I’ve seen in the file, counsel on both sides felt that there were some chance that this would be accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.801" offset="1218539">At least they were content.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.191" offset="1232123">Nobody could tell of course what the Legislatures or the Executive part on either of the States would have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.928" offset="1267127">So, it had gone just that far that the offer was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.772" offset="1294503">Unfortunately, the counsel for State of Kentucky, John Browning, who had been handling the case since the very outset was killed in an automobile accident about two weeks after the offer was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.728" offset="1374333">Ultimately, in November 1970, Kentucky simply rejected the offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.363" offset="1420831">That was in November.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.807" offset="1434624">A little over a month later, the administration in Ohio changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.915" offset="1459075">A new Attorney General came in and he asked -- well, nobody in was left on the staff who had worked on this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.363" offset="1508812">So he asked that a complete reexamination of the file and everything connected with it be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.843" offset="1546742">That was done and after about four or five months study, recommendation was made to the Attorney General that an effort be made to ask this Court to permit an Amendment of the complaint in order to permit Ohio to make an argument that it was entitled to a line in the middle of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.888" offset="1678921">We didn’t want to go off the deep end on this without checking and we called the Attorney General’s office in Kentucky and asked him to look through Mr. Browning’s files and see whether there was anything that would make it clear that we were in error, that we couldn’t possibly prevail on that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.227" offset="1796263">Well, we got no answer from that call.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.554" offset="1821550">And eventually we filed the motion to amend the complaint which is pending before the Court at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.087" offset="1859688">That was done in August 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.942" offset="1879124">And what we did was to add the first count of the complaint that is alleging that the real boundary between the two states lies in the middle of the river, and then there were some minor alterations in the further parts of the original complaint that is, if the Court disagrees with us on the -- permitting us to amend the or to -- or if the Master were to find against us on the middle of the river, then we would still argue for the 1792 line.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.352" offset="2068773">And the third question involved is the question of concurrent jurisdiction, which is I think irrelevant as far as the present proceeding is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.623" offset="2129899">The Court referred our motion to the Master, and that was argued before the Master in December 1971, and in April he filed his report making a recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.911" offset="2210983">That recommendation was that our motion to amend be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.550" offset="2237524">The Master’s grounds for that were that the new allegations as to the middle of the river failed to state a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.632" offset="2293948">He also said that even if we did state a cause of action, our -- any relief for Ohio would be barred by this Court’s opinions in the series of cases discussing the Indiana-Kentucky borderline.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.737" offset="2398333">And finally, he said that there were three separate cases in the Supreme Court of Ohio in which it -- which indicated that the State of Ohio acquiesced in those Indiana-Kentucky cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.862" offset="2482866">Our position is that the new allegations that we had made alleging that the boundary line does lie in the middle of the river clearly state a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.665" offset="2550053">We also contend that we are in no way barred by this Court’s decisions and the Indiana-Kentucky boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.658" offset="2589968">We were not parties to that, those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.554" offset="2605537">And finally that we -- the three particular cases that the Master picked up from the Supreme Court and found to be acquiescence in the Indiana-Kentucky line of cases, do not so hold, and that we are -- that’s the only thing in the case so far that goes to the point of acquiescence, and that outside of that, that point should not be further considered at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.098" offset="2771780">Now, I really have nothing much to add to the arguments that have been made in the brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1216.843" offset="4970768">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.694" offset="4986128">Mr. Howard has fairly stated the facts and history of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.947" offset="5003160">However, we wish to emphasize two points at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.131" offset="5019878">First, we wish to point out that Kentucky did challenge the sufficiency of the allegations to state a cause of action, but that we did not do this in the form of an affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.570" offset="5069615">We rather raised it as a point of law, much as in common law demurrer, and that point was that the allegations of the State of Ohio are immaterial, that is, if they are true, they in no way change the boundary which was established by Congress long ago based upon the session of Virginia and the acts of Congress thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.531" offset="5165537">Secondly, we wish to point out that in the original complaint of 1966, the State of Ohio conceded that the boundary between the states of Kentucky and Ohio was the low water mark on the northern shore as that mark existed in 1792.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.458" offset="5241187">They further conceded that the states involved in the Handly Lessee versus Anthony case, that is, Indiana and Kentucky, should control as between Ohio and Kentucky based upon the identical title relationship of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.678" offset="5318092">Thus, they recognized that Handly was controlling and should control as between Ohio and Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.733" offset="5342333">And they have recognized this for more than 150 years since the decision in Handly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.792" offset="5362500">At least it has been recognized to the extent that they were judicially aware of Handly, and yet have set by inactively for a period of at least 150 years until the amendment is now sought attempting to establish the boundary in the middle of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.420" offset="5441076">We submit that the recommendation of the Special Master was correct for two basic reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.744" offset="5466363">The first reason is what we refer to as the immateriality of any alleged defect in the title of Virginia where the boundary was clearly fixed by Congress based upon the session of Virginia and the acts of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.161" offset="5524041">Secondly, we submit that the Special Master’s recommendation was correct due to the judicial admissions found in the 1966 pleadings and the judicial and historical acquiescence upon the part of Ohio which is undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.418" offset="5593004">Let us briefly deal with the first allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.148" offset="5607946">Ohio claims that the boundary is in the middle of the river now, based upon and alleged defect in Virginia’s title due to various pre-revolutionary war documents and actions by the British Crown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.344" offset="5668760">We submit that after the Revolutionary War, all of the territories situate within the United States was a part of the United States and any claim are derivative claim of the British Crown was clearly extinguished by the results of the Revolutionary War.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.401" offset="5740962">Once Virginia ceded the land, situate lying and being to the north of the River Ohio for the sole purpose of creating new states and once the Sovereign United States accepted this session and the terms thereof and recognize the sovereignty of Virginia over the entire river, any defect in that title to the land north of the river is clearly immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.659" offset="5854020">The only two parties involved, the Sovereign State of Virginia and the Sovereign United States based upon the negotiations involved, recognized that the boundary was to be on the northern shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.339" offset="5900727">Certainly, they had the authority to act and did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.876" offset="5914833">And the boundary was clearly established as residing within Virginia on the northern shore and all the land south of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.245" offset="5952345">This was determined long before the State of Ohio was ever created.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.292" offset="5968541">And Ohio was in no position now to vindicate the rights of the province of Quebec or to vindicate the rights of the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.760" offset="6002395">It can only vindicate any rights that they’ve acquired since they became a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.213" offset="6020263">And we submit that clearly the boundary was determined based upon the acceptance of Congress of the Virginia session.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.041" offset="6051506">It is that law that is the law of the Sovereign United States which must govern this boundary dispute and not the law of any foreign political entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.353" offset="6100825">The Special Master has not rejected this as Ohio claims and if indeed it -- Judge Foreman did, this Court can certainly hold otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.649" offset="6145964">We submit that the session of Virginia and the legislative enactments did indeed become the subject of judicial interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.617" offset="6185880">In Handly’s Lessee versus Anthony, the Supreme Court judicially recognized and accepted the legislative enactments involved and resolved the boundary dispute reasoning to the language of that session of Virginia itself and also to the acts of Congress involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="2871.655" offset="11589987">May I say just -- make just a couple of points on the estoppel and acquiescence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.098" offset="11623737">That question was raised in the United States versus California, the first Tidelands Oil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.671" offset="11658010">California claimed that the United States was stopped from claiming title to that three-mile belt of the California coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.154" offset="11707956">It claimed that the United States have acquiesced in California’s claims of title for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.096" offset="11747767">Nevertheless, the Court’s opinion written by Mr. Justice Black, refused to accept that argument and discussed it at some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.011" offset="11795414">I think that is -- seems to me to be controlling in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.147" offset="11823940">The other point is, recently there have been a number of bridges constructed between Ohio and Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.303" offset="11864586">They were the subject of contracts between the two states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.840" offset="11890709">The contracts provided that Kentucky would pay for the bridge up to the low water mark on the north side of the river and Ohio would pay for the rest of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.057" offset="11935640">That’s on the Ohio side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.250" offset="11944417">But, the contracts also provided that nothing said therein should be determinative of where the boundary line lay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.157" offset="11987989">That shows that Ohio was still maintaining its position that the boundary line was not at the low water mark.</text>
