            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll hear argument next in 71-564, District of Columbia against Carter.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard W. Barton</label>
            <text syncTime="32.342" offset="232782">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.562" offset="249605">The question which is before the Court in this case is whether or not the District of Columbia, a congressionally created municipal corporation is a person within the meaning of the 1871 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.880" offset="346885">The court below answered the question in the affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.053" offset="363604">It is our contention that it should be answered in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.293" offset="384502">In this respect, we rely upon the decision of this Court in Monroe versus Pape in a host of circuit court decisions elsewhere throughout the country and upon the legislative history of the 1871 Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.153" offset="471960">We start with the proposition that is undisputed and that is, that if the District of Columbia and other municipal corporations are persons within the meaning of the 1871 Act, it is because and only because the Congress so intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.316" offset="560671">Now, this Court in 1961 in Monroe versus Pape in a unanimous opinion on this point, an opinion authored by Mr. Justice Douglas, expressly held as we read the opinion that Congress did not intend municipalities to be included within the word person as used in the 1871 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.377" offset="684910">The court below held that notwithstanding Monroe versus Pape, the District of Columbia was a person within the meaning of that Act and it did so on two independent grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.084" offset="759724">First, that Monroe versus Pape did not hold that municipalities were not persons within the meaning of the Act but rather held that they were persons within the meaning of the Act, but that municipalities could not be held liable in damages under the Civil Rights Act to the extent that they were immune under local law.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.415" offset="885008">Now, the court did not phrase it in quite that way, but that is the necessary effect of the court’s holding because it held that the Civil Rights Act, the word person as used in that the Act did encompass the District of Columbia which is indisputable a municipal corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.672" offset="994095">In reaching the decision that it did, the court relied upon the legislative history of the 1871 Civil Rights Act which was thoroughly explored by this Court in its opinion in Monroe.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.852" offset="1070791">It pointed out that one of the reasons, one of the principal reasons which led to the so-called Sherman Amendment or amendments, there were two of them, the second one is slightly watered-down version, indicated that many of the members of the Congress were then concerned with whether or not the Congress could consistent with the constitution imposed liability upon municipal corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.827" offset="1210702">That issue was very hotly argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.161" offset="1223973">Some took the position that it could, others took the position that it could not, but when the Congress rejected that amendment, the Sherman Amendment, now the Sherman Amendment would have made municipalities liable for actions within their borders by persons riotously and tumultuously assembled together which was a clear reference to the Ku Klux Klan and similar organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.761" offset="1374438">That amendment was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.216" offset="1392201">Some I think projected it because they were convinced that it was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.404" offset="1416965">Others perhaps rejected it because they thought it was unwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.123" offset="1435878">Perhaps still others because they thought it was both unwise and unconstitutional, but the amendment was clearly rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.836" offset="1478719">And as this Court unanimously concluded in Monroe versus Pape, that legislative history is so forceful as a reflection of the intent of Congress that it would just be impossible to conclude that the Congress intended to include municipalities within the meaning of the term person as it used it in that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.082" offset="1591672">Now, one of the things that the court below relied upon was the argument which had been advanced to this Court in Monroe versus Pape but which is not referred to in its opinion and that is that, in light of the concern of Congress as to whether or not it could impose liabilities on municipalities when they were immune under local law, the court should limit the -- its holding, the one that it eventually made in Monroe versus Pape to a holding that municipalities are liable under the Civil Rights Act only to the extent that they are liable under local law.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.822" offset="1826670">Now, the second basis for the lower court’s decision was a utilization of 1988 of Title 42.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.690" offset="1874108">Now, that is the statute which permits federal courts when they are administering federal laws and this would include 1983 to borrow provisions of state laws to assist the federal court in implementing a right which is given by a federal statute or the federal constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.579" offset="1989674">But what the court below has done here is not utilized Section 1988 to implement a right, but rather to create a right which under this Court’s decision in Monroe versus Pape does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.511" offset="2069400">This Court said in Monroe versus Pape that there is no right to bring an action for damages against a municipality under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.881" offset="2118928">So the court made an end-run so to speak around that and said, “But you can borrow local law and if local law provides for liability then you can adopt that liability and use that to implement the nonexistent remedy that you have against the municipality under 1983.”</text>
            <text syncTime="535.744" offset="2246301">We submit that that is just not sound reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.980" offset="2263333">It has been rejected by several circuit court decisions, two in the Seventh Circuit, one in the Ninth Circuit, since the decision in this case came down.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.943" offset="2355179">Those decisions are -- the latest of those decisions is Moor versus Madigan the Ninth Circuit decision which discusses the two slightly earlier Seventh Circuit decisions that is -- it was decided on April the 12th of this year and was reported in 458 Federal 2nd at 1217.</text>

            <text syncTime="627.097" offset="2611806">There are two Second Circuit Court -- Seventh Circuit court decisions and those are both cited and referred to in the Moor versus Madigan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.382" offset="2656946">Those were decided in October and November of 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.929" offset="2707101">The second independent ground that the court used for finding the District of Columbia amenable to suit under the Civil Rights Act was that the legislative history of the act indicated again that the Congress was primarily concerned with the constitutionality of imposing liability upon municipalities and that that reluctance to do so which the Congress gave into could not have applied to the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.428" offset="2873135">That Congress under the constitution has plenary jurisdiction over the District of Columbia and it could not have been concerned with whether or not it could, had it chose to do so impose liability upon the municipal corporation of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.550" offset="2953592">That of course is quite true as far as it goes, clearly the Congress could have done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.635" offset="2973863">There is nothing in the legislative history that we have been able to find that even mentions the District of Columbia or indicates that Congress was in anyway concerned about the District of Columbia or the applicability of the Act to the district.</text>

            <text syncTime="733.003" offset="3035408">Well, what you have just said leads me to inquire whether or not it is settled that Section 1983 applies to the District of Columbia at all quite apart from this now a question about liability of a municipality certainly by its legislative history with which I am reasonably familiar having written a couple of opinions in the area, indicates concern by Congress of what was being done in the individual states, particularly the states which had recently been -- involved in the war between the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.912" offset="3203009">The statute talks about under the color of any statute of any state or territory I would suppose a legislative history would indicate certainly that Congress wasn't concerned with the District of Columbia over which it had exclusive legislative and other control.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.280" offset="3288482">Is it settled?</text>

            <text syncTime="1264.955" offset="5163238">It is of course limited as to what it can be elsewhere with the interior operation of municipalities or states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.045" offset="5215587">The other side contends here that Monroe versus Pape should be well in effect overruled by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.079" offset="5251636">And its argument in support of that is that a number of other lower federal courts have notwithstanding Monroe versus Pape applied it in cases seeking injunctive relief and that is true there are four circuits which I have held that notwithstanding Monroe versus Pape, you can seek injunctive relief against a state municipality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.807" offset="5386637">There are a number of other cases that hold to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.868" offset="5406804">Those states that have done so have relied upon footnote 50 in this Court’s opinion in Monroe versus Pape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.866" offset="5446823">Several commentators have suggested that they have completely rewritten or misunderstood that footnote 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.832" offset="5490709">That it does not hold as several of the circuit courts concluded hold that they were limiting, the court was limiting its holding in Monroe versus Pape only the actions for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.368" offset="5544835">And that you could still bring an action for injunctive relief under 1983 notwithstanding Monroe versus Pape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.105" offset="5583809">That would appear to be completely inconsistent with the reasoning on Monroe versus Pape because if a municipality is not a person within the meaning of the Act as this Court held, then it would not be a person either for injunctive relief or court damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.239" offset="5664371">But as a recent District Court in Delaware pointed out perhaps all this is de minimis because in none of the cases in which the courts have granted injunctive relief under 1983 has the municipality been the only entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.985" offset="5747336">In every other case, in every case there has been governmental officials, members of the school board, the city council, the mayor, the police department or what not are members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.785" offset="5802506">If they are amenable to injunctive action under the Act, it does not really add very much to say -- to add the municipality too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.768" offset="5846392">Because the municipality of course can act only through its agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.770" offset="5862484">If you enjoin its agents the members of the school board, the city council, the Chief of Police, you are not really adding anything else if you enjoin the municipality on top of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.378" offset="5916923">So those cases while we submit are not soundly decided, they do not militate against the soundness of Monroe versus Pape as we see it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1483.773" offset="6038444">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.147" offset="6051924">Several years ago in a law review article written on the subject of Police External Review Boards, a then judge of the circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia made mention of the omnipresent of review mechanisms at every level of our complex form of government, even at the level of judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.862" offset="6150771">He said, “Given the Supreme Court is not fully immune for in common with all judges they are at the mercy of the most cold blooded external review ever devised by man.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.409" offset="6205001">I refer to the law professors who spent six months doing an autopsy on an appellate opinion often written under pressure in four or five days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.271" offset="6244498">Mr. Chief Justice I do not know what case, if any, you had in mind when you wrote those words but it is certainly applicable to Monroe versus Pape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.015" offset="6279398">For under 12 years that have elapse since that decisions of Printers Inc. and particularly in the two or three years, there has been a continuing barrage of criticism in the law reviews aimed at that portion of the decision which held that a city is not a person within the meaning of Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.736" offset="6370304">The latest addition to that volume of criticism appeared too recently bring conclusion in our brief and I would like to cite the court to it at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.590" offset="6405726">It is a comment in the University of Virginia law review, volume 58 commencing at page 143 which takes as it's text the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case and which is entitled perhaps somewhat over enthusiastically Carter versus Carlson the Monroe Doctrine at Bay.</text>

            <text syncTime="1599.462" offset="6501230">Now the essence of these several law review articles which are cited in our brief is essentially three-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.026" offset="6547519">In the first place, it has been pointed out that the historical analysis which underlay this Court's decision in Monroe, misconstrued the significance of the legislative history of the Sherman Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.944" offset="6619199">Secondly, it has been pointed out that in the subsequent cases of the lower courts and indeed of this Court, the Monroe holding has been departed from, has been eroded by the many cases which have granted equitable relief against municipalities and finally it has been pointed out and we concur in this suggestion that if it is open for the Court to reexamine its holding in Monroe, then all of the relevant policy considerations militate toward a different finding and that is, that a city is a person within the meaning of 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.154" offset="6776038">Now if the Court -- I should come back to those points in just a moment, if this Court notwithstanding these considerations should decline to reexamine its holding in Monroe at this time then we say that nevertheless decision of the court below should be affirmed because Monroe is distinguishable for the various reasons that were set forth in the opinion of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.265" offset="6868407">That is the rational of Monroe is inapplicable to municipalities which are not immune under local law and secondly that the District of Columbia is a unique entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.341" offset="6908740">But those arguments I would prefer to leave for my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.208" offset="6920234">They have been dealt with extensively there and in the opinion of the court below and I would like to discuss at this time the reasons for reexamining Monroe as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.450" offset="6961194">Let me respond first to the question raised by Mr. Justice Stewart a few moments ago as to whether the District of Columbia is in fact involved in Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.581" offset="7013648">I think that this Court disposed of that question in Hurd versus Hodge which was a 1947 decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.808" offset="7042591">It was a companion case to Shelley versus Kraemer, and it held that the district was a state of territory within the meaning of Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.093" offset="7079790">I don’t believe that there has been any question about that in any case since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.486" offset="7101315">There had been a couple of lower court cases which have repeated that statement since then one is Sewell versus Pegelow a Forth Circuit case found a 291 F.2d, page 196.</text>

            <text syncTime="1830.247" offset="7424397">Finally I turn briefly to the legislative history which I think is very important in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.686" offset="7454072">This Court predicated its holding in Monroe virtually exclusively on the legislative history of 1983 and the Sherman Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.214" offset="7504227">Subsequent research has indicated that historical analysis misconstrued the significance of the Sherman Amendment and of the matters that were put forth in debate in the Sherman Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.357" offset="7572773">Now if one reads the legislative, the Congressional Globe of 1971 and the measure which is here onto discussion that is 1983 and its amendments takes up virtually the entire first session of the 42nd Congress more than some 500 pages of 6 point, type 3 columns to the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.083" offset="7687711">If one reached through that considerable literature, one comes to two rather significant conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.262" offset="7712371">The first is that when the Congress was debating what is now Section 1983 itself, it never mentioned municipal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.533" offset="7749465">And the second is that when it discussed the Sherman Amendment in which context it did discussed municipal liability it was talking about something very different from what was involved into 1983 and the principal objections to the Sherman Amendment are not applicable to the consideration of municipal liability under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.195" offset="7844133">Now 1983 was first discussed on March 25, 1871 and I must take a moment to go into this history in some detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.369" offset="7880808">This was pursuant to a message from President Grant that was received on March 23 of that year urging the Congress to enact some effectual legislation to vindicate Fourteenth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.297" offset="7936606">From March 25 for a period of several days, approximately 10 days from March 25, 1983 itself was discussed a great length in the house and it was finally passed in the house with no mention whatever of municipal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.263" offset="7996374">It then went to the senate t here it was again discussed for several days with no mention of municipal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.460" offset="8021243">On April 15, just before the vote came in the senate, the so-called Sherman Amendment which would have imposed riot damage liability on municipalities without fault, that amendment was added just before the vote came there was no debate root came there was no debate and the amendment -- the Sherman Amendment and 1983 itself was passed by the senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.912" offset="8114970">So that on April 15, after nearly 20 days of debate, 1983 without the Sherman Amendment in the house, with the Sherman Amendment in the senate had been passed by both branches without any debate whatever on municipal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.555" offset="8177560">It was only after that point when it went back to the house that there ensued the vigorous debate over the Sherman Amendment and the essence of the opposition to the Sherman Amendment was not any hostility to the idea of municipal liability per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.055" offset="8243597">Rather it was hostility to the idea of municipal liability without fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.361" offset="8268779">Representative Kerr one of the most articulate opponents of the Sherman Amendment made it very clear on April 19 at page 788 of the Congressional Globe when he said of course in effect, that of course there would be no objection to the this Bill if it merely imposed liability for a breach of a duty which a municipality had and he pointed to examples which existed at the time of municipal liability for failure to repair streets or bridges, whether it was a duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.954" offset="8383195">In fact, he even said there would be no objection to municipal liability for riot damage if there were some fault involved, if it were required and he -- and there were other statutes in existence at this time, of this nature in New York, Maryland and Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.101" offset="8443800">If they were fault on the part of the municipal officials, the Maryland Statute at the time I believe provided that there will be liability for riot damage if the municipal authorities had noticed that the riot was going to occur and had it within their power to prevent it and did nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.279" offset="8512449">In that situation, municipal liability would have been alright and in fact on April 20 when 1983 was finally passed in the house it was with a substitution for the Sherman Amendment which was consistent with Representative Kerr's feelings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.322" offset="8588622">That substitution is now Section 1986, the so called “Passive Accomplice Provision” which provides that if anyone is aware that a deprivation of Civil Rights is going to take place and takes no steps to prevent it, but has it in its power to prevent it or aid in preventing it then he too is liable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2514.589" offset="10161716">I do not that know that there has been any action on the part of Congress to do that, but of course as this Court has pointed out on various occasions --</text>

            <label>Mr. Warren K. Kaplan</label>
            <text syncTime="2528.488" offset="10217305">I am not aware of any, Your Honor, but since the exemption of municipalities came about as a result of a judicial decision by this Court I would think that the reinstatement of municipalities as proper defendants could come about by the same route.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.936" offset="10295150">Although legislation would certainly be welcome I do not think that in this case it would be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.049" offset="10331617">Well, I would like to come back just for a moment to the legislative history and what is now Section 1986 which was the substitution for the Sherman Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.973" offset="10403297">We have a statute which imposes liability where there is fault, where there is knowledge that a deprivation is going to occur and the defendant is in a position where he could aid or he could prevent or aid in preventing the deprivation and there is their liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.969" offset="10471215">That meets the objection to the Sherman Amendment that Representative Kerr felt was so important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.805" offset="10498591">So that the -- that substitution is I think consistent with the notion that there should be liability where there is fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.675" offset="10542059">It is consistent with the notion that in municipality maybe a person within the meaning of Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.842" offset="10582706">Since this Court's decision in Monroe as counsel has pointed out, there have been several circuits, the Fourth, the Fifth, the Seventh, the Tenth which have notwithstanding the very clear mandate of this Court in footnote 50 to Monroe which has stated that “a municipality may nevertheless be a person for 1983 purposes where equitable relief is sought.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.771" offset="10682493">This Court has in fact indicated its approval of that distinction in the subsequent cases of Turner versus City of Memphis, Tinker versus Des Moines that McNeese versus Board of Education in which without discussing the point, the Court implicitly approved the granting of equitable relief against the state subdivisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.474" offset="10777266">I think that the attempts made by some commentators to rationalize this distinction between the granting of equitable relief and the granting of damages cannot withstand close analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.686" offset="10830137">Now the rationalization that is most often put forth is that equitable relief involves a lesser threat to the municipal treasury, and therefore, a municipality maybe a person for equitable purposes where it would not be if the claim were for damages, but the problem with that distinction, the problems are three-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.825" offset="10930657">First of all, it is inconsistent with 1983 itself which expressly says that “Where there is -- where you have a person who is depriving another person of his Fourteenth Amendment Rights, he shall be liable in an action for damages or equitable relief or any other proper proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.794" offset="11010591">Secondly, it is inconsistent with the facts of the matter, the fact of the matter being, an equitable relief may frequently involve the expenditure of very large sums of money, much more than are ought to be involved in an action for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.189" offset="11088123">For example, in the case of Harkless versus Sweeney Independent School, which came before this term -- before this Court last term in which the Court denied certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.071" offset="11127620">That -- there was an action by ten black school teachers for reinstatement and back pay under Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.730" offset="11158340">They have been out of work for some five years and the Fifth Circuit granted reinstatement and back pay under the guise of granting equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.658" offset="11198046">Although the payment of some -- several hundred thousand dollars was potentially involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.902" offset="11226990">In the case of Griffin versus Prince Edward County, I don’t believe that came up under 1983, but it was an example of the granting of equitable relief at enormous cost to the state subdivision where this Court ordered the Prince Edward County Schools to be reopened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.730" offset="11306297">Finally, this distinction between equitable relief and legal relief is inconsistent with the statements of this Court in the Bevins case decided last term in which the Court indicated that where there is jurisdiction to grant equitable relief there ought also to be jurisdiction to grant legal relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.105" offset="11403786">I think that the proposition that we are contending for that is that the court upon reexamining its holding in Monroe should conclude that a municipality is or maybe a person within the meaning of 1983 is consistent not only with the legislative history and not only with the subsequent post Monroe cases granting equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.185" offset="11504097">It is also consistent with the overall purpose of 1983 as expressed by President Grant and with contemporary notions of social justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.380" offset="11548923">We no longer believe as people did 200 years ago in the case of Russell versus Men of Devon that it is better for an individual to suffer an injury than for the public to suffer something inconvenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.616" offset="11601795">Contemporary notions of risk spreading are so well entrenched that just within the last dozen years, since Monroe, in some 27 jurisdictions, the doctrine of sovereign immunity has been partially or wholly abrogated either judicially or through legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.163" offset="11675982">And in some nine other jurisdictions, municipalities maybe liable in action to damages where they have insurance and all that has occurred just almost entirely since this Court's decision in Monroe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.478" offset="11733243">Finally, municipal liability is essential if we are to achieve the two-fold objectives of deterrence of police misconduct and compensation for that misconduct when it occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.539" offset="11793533">Police misconduct as was pointed out by the US Commission on Civil Rights in 1961 has been and continues to be a very serious problem in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.028" offset="11835434">In fact just a few weeks ago there came across my desk in American Bar Association Report, the tentative draft of standards relating to the urban police function which says, “The continuing failure to devise and implement necessary procedures and sanctions to deal with police abuses is one of the most critical problems now confronting our society.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.693" offset="11938147">And that is not the American Civil Liberties Union talking or the US Commission on Civil Rights, that is the American Bar Association.</text>

            <text syncTime="2992.042" offset="12071581">Well I believe they are concerned with that too, but I think it is clear that they are also concerned with Tort liability to third persons because they go on to urge that sovereign immunity should be abrogated by judicial decision where it still remains.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.965" offset="12151202">I think they are concerned with all of those purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.578" offset="12173667">Of course as far as compensation is concerned there can be no meaningful compensation for victims of police brutality without municipal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.515" offset="12213478">This Court in Mapp versus Ohio and the Fourth Circuit in Lankford versus Gelstonin and other courts in other cases have taken judicial notice of the fact that policeman are notoriously unsatisfactory defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.804" offset="12266559">That they are habitually and incorrigibly judgment proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.241" offset="12288293">When they can be found and this case presents to another example of why they are unsatisfactory defendants, for in this case, the defendant John Carlson who on August 19th put on a pair of brass knuckles and beat the plaintiff's face into a bloody pulp has not even been found for service of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.833" offset="12358719">So that there frequently can be no compensation for victims of police brutality without municipal liability and that has been pointed out by a vast number of commentators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.237" offset="12416293">Well, I would say finally that another reason for imposing the municipal liability is that which is put forth by Judge Nickels in his concurring opinion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.317" offset="12484629">And that is to give some protection to the policeman so that the policeman will know that he does not any longer stand alone, that he has a municipality on his side to provide a defense for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.024" offset="12555473">I believe that all of these relevant -- all of the relevant policy considerations point unequivocally to the imposition of municipal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.425" offset="12605106">I see that my time has all but expired and I would like to leave the court with one further thought and that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.612" offset="12641782">In the -- for more than a century now the paper promises of the Fourteenth Amendment have for very many of our citizens in many parts of this country and in many aspects of your lives, particularly where police misconduct is concerned, have remained essentially that, that is paper promises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.579" offset="12725687">In this case at this time this Court has a rare opportunity, the first such opportunity since Monroe v. Pape was argued 12 years ago this week, to transform those paper promises into meaningful reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.672" offset="12786082">Now I know that Mr. Carter, the respondent in this case who sits in the back of this room today has not fully understood all of the dialog that has just transpired filled as it unavoidably was will legal, with complex abstractions and jargon of our profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.506" offset="12861419">But he and the hundreds of Melvin Caters across this land will understand the impact of this Court's decision and it is on his and their behalf that I most earnestly and respectfully urge this Court not to let this opportunity putting teeth into the Fourteenth Amendment pass, to pass un-exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.870" offset="12938846">Thank you very much.</text>
