            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="38.506" offset="257442">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.293" offset="268518">This case is here on appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia which entered a judgment for the State of New York against the United States to which the United States consented and the judgment did two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.592" offset="329749">First, it exempted the State of New York from certain requirements of the Voting Rights Act of 1970, which I shall describe in more detail shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.902" offset="371022">Briefly, the requirements from which the state was exempted were of two sorts.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.940" offset="387114">One, it was exempted from the necessity of pre-clearance of voting Law changes as required by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act and secondly, it was allowed to restore its literacy tests earlier than otherwise would have been permitted under the Voting Rights Act of 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.592" offset="461720">The judgment below also denied intervention to the appellants here when they attempted to enter the litigation to urge upon the Court that New York should remain subject to the provisions of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.089" offset="519711">In January and March 1970, New York redistricted its assembly, state senate and congressional districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.784" offset="554506">Appellants who are black and Puerto Rican citizens of New York City and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People view the 1970 redistricting changes as an illegal racial gerrymander.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.086" offset="623679">They claim that the redistricting took most of the black and Puerto Rican population in Brooklyn for one thing and carved it up to distribute it in little pieces among contiguous white districts making the black population smaller parts of the larger white population in the white districts as part of a racial gerrymander which would dilute, what otherwise would be considerable political strength held together by a bond of common factors related to race.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.568" offset="733602">I want to make clear that the validity of those charges of racial gerrymander are not before the Court in this case, but the question of whether appellants can have a day in Court, so to speak, to establish the validity of those claims, now what sort of a day that would be is of the essence of this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.050" offset="815522">The day in Court which appellants sought were the days in Court or before a forum, proper forum which they sought were of three different kinds, all interrelated and again only one of which is here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.872" offset="870902">The adverse judgment in the District of Columbia disallowing intervention washed out all possibility of the other two.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.950" offset="903189">The first forum would have been before the Attorney General of the United States under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.295" offset="928580">When we learned that these voting changes were in process and their implementation were in process --</text>

            <text syncTime="210.182" offset="944149">The time, Mr. Greenberg, last week I think it was, we had a case argued here Georgia versus United States and there was a question of whether Section 5 reached the reapportionments?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="222.092" offset="991692">Yes that is involved here and so far as that is the concerned, the Government takes the same position as we do, but more than that is involved, Mr. Justice Brennan, because also there is the question of whether New York can resume its literacy tests when the 1975 ban expires.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.684" offset="1046131">So even if the Georgia case would decide that adversely, this case would still be here with regard to the literacy test.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="245.238" offset="1084374">The first forum in which we sought to appear was before the Attorney General of the United States under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.590" offset="1113736">The appellants communicated with the Attorney General concerning the January and March voting changes and said that when New York submitted its applications for clearance of these voting changes, the appellants wanted to appear as prescribed by the regulations and make representation of these changes were made with the purpose and the effect of racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.685" offset="1218121">In fact, the State of New York did submit one set of changes to the Attorney General, but they were sent back as incomplete.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.245" offset="1244348">They never sent them back again.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.714" offset="1254275">Second, the second forum in which we sought to appear and this opportunity also was washed out by the District of Columbia judgment was in the Southern District of New York, we filed what for the purposes of brevity, I would describe as an Allen type lawsuit, a lawsuit seeking an injunction to compel the State of New York to submit its Voting Rights Act changes to the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.161" offset="1348002">And of course, when the District of Columbia judgment was entered, that exempted New York from the requirements of Voting Rights Act so that Allen type lawsuit essentially is wiped out also.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.487" offset="1389275">Thirdly, on the day that we filed the lawsuit in New York, we sought to intervene in the pending litigation between New York and the United States in the District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.770" offset="1446431">Now the United States did not oppose intervention although the State of New York did.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.989" offset="1467329">The District Court denied intervention without opinion and granted summary judgment for New York without opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.537" offset="1493556">Now appellants have had no hearing before the Attorney General, the appellants have had no hearing in the District Court of New York and appellants have had no hearing from the District Courts of the District of Columbia.</text>

            <text syncTime="356.643" offset="1529919">Mr. Greenberg, you filed an independent action up in New York challenging the redistricting as such?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="361.996" offset="1551339">No, we did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.981" offset="1555310">We merely filed an Allen type action in New York urging that the changes should be submitted to the Attorney General of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.736" offset="1594284">The United States, as I read its brief and what it said in this case, does not claim that intervention in cases of this sort never can be allowed and indeed it maybe of some relevance if the United States did not oppose or intervention in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.703" offset="1650186">Rather as I understand the position of the government, it is two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.038" offset="1667532">One, that there was no showing of inadequate representation by the United States in the court below and second that the application of the appellants was untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.440" offset="1709119">We submit that the record makes clear; one, that representation of the claims of the interveners or the appellants by the United States was indeed inadequate and that it is the timeliness not only where we nearly timely, but the application was filed at the optimum, the best possible time that it could have in the interest of the litigation, in the interest of efficient operation of the Courts, in the interest of the appellant and all the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.891" offset="1818937">And finally we claim in the words of Rule 24 that the disposition below quite clearly impaired and impeded the appellant's opportunity to protect their interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.049" offset="1859584">To demonstrate that there was inadequate representation of our claim below, it is first necessary to describe what that claim is and what adequate representation would have consisted of and how existing representations failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.628" offset="1917889">We'll first discuss this, then the issue of timeliness and then the issue of how it was --</text>

            <text syncTime="498.677" offset="2098030">Yes and we might take that as a protective position Mr. Justice White, but I think we're so clearly right as to intervention as of right, we have not argued that except to mention it in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.780" offset="2146513">Now as to inadequacy of representation, the claims of the intervenors arose in the Voting Rights Act of 1970 which specifically granted its protection to the black and Puerto Rican voters of Bronx, Kings and New York counties in the State of New York because the amendment specifically and the legislative history demonstrate exhaustively carried out the design of Congress and the administration to present it to vote of Congress, to cover the north as well as the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.160" offset="2256018">The 1965 law had covered the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.681" offset="2266049">When time came to extend the law, it was quite clear that the general sentiment of the administration and of Congress was that it would be extended only if were made nationwide and that is what was done and the legislative history is replete with references to the fact that Bronx, Kings and New York county would be covered designed for that very purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.109" offset="2351835">Numerous senators and the Attorney Generals so testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.643" offset="2369912">The formula that covers these counties is that in 1968, they had to view the literacy test and few than 50% of the persons of voting age registered for voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.608" offset="2413798">That coverage meant two things, when a covered jurisdiction may not use a literacy test while covered by Section 4 and 5 and no changes in the voting laws may be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.063" offset="2459669">The keywords in the statute and they are in Section 4 which appears in the statutory appendix of our brief is that no such test or devise has been used during the ten years preceding the filing of the action for the purpose or with the effect and I would like to underscore the word effect of denying or bridging the right to vote on account of race and color.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.152" offset="2563950">Now the meaning of the words purpose and effect can be found extensively throughout the legislative history and in numerous reported decisions, many of which from this court which was set forth in the brief but for purposes of brevity I am just focusing on one thing about which I think there is no disagreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.720" offset="2626226">I’d like to talk about this Court’s opinion in Gaston County against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.217" offset="2648273">Meaning of purpose and effect is elucidated in that opinion in several ways that's directly pertinent to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.999" offset="2679411">Gaston County case decided under the 1965 version of the Voting Rights Act and the 65 version differs from the 70 version only in that, no longer is Gaston County included and southern counties, but that the Congress intended to cover Bronx, Kings and New York counties quite explicitly.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.796" offset="2766555">Now the Gaston County case held that the 1965 Act applied to a jurisdiction where non- whites were more illiterate than whites because they had received an inferior education in the county and Justice Harlan’s opinion says that he assumes that they were residents of the county at the time they received their education, but there is a footnote which says “the result would be no different if they had migrated from other counties elsewhere where they had received an education which had caused them to be illiterate.”</text>
            <text syncTime="695.074" offset="2883688">And Attorney General Mitchell and numerous senators testified extensively as we have set forth in our brief that that same principle of an inferior education leading to illiteracy or an inferior education in another jurisdiction causing someone to become literate, who then moved to a northern jurisdiction, brings that northern jurisdiction under coverage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.697" offset="2982118">Now if we just talk briefly about this quite clear aspect of what constitutes effect of racial discrimination, one would think that for there to be adequate representation of the interest of the claimants in the District Court, that should have been brought to the attention of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.538" offset="3057560">That legal explication of the statute should have been at least presented to the District Court if not urged upon it and such evidence as might be available should have been also presented to the District Court, so that the Court could make a judgment as to whether or not Bronx, Kings and New York county came under the Gaston County decision but that was not done at all and we just say with, one can elaborate under a great deal that if the key legal principle and the available facts, many of which have appeared in our motion to alter judgment when after we were denied intervention, we came back again and said, “look, if you are taking the position that we haven't presented the evidence, we don’t have to present the evidence on a motion to intervene but nevertheless here is at least such of it as we can gather in this brief period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.060" offset="3247626">If that available evidence was not also presented to the District Court, then we say that it is inadequate representation, per se, and as a matter of law and as a matter of common sense we just don't see how it can be claimed that there was such a thing as an inadequate --</text>

            <text syncTime="1273.340" offset="5196779">More of which we pointed out that to the extent if there is any inconvenience, we have to look at the fact that New York waited 18 months after the Voting Act was passed and nine months after the Attorney General said that it was covered to even file its action, then he gave the United States 90 days.</text>

            <text syncTime="1419.786" offset="5782549">We believe that was the primary reason why the District Court denied intervention at the time that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.251" offset="5804387">The second thing is that the 4A judgment is now outstanding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1437.489" offset="5853288">So that since the 4A judgment is now outstanding, that is exempting New York, there won’t be a disruption of elections in the future while the appellants' motion is determined and the timeliness problem which we consider from the point of view of not only how long has this action been pending but what effect would allowing intervention at this time have on the State of New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="1463.600" offset="5957778">Now I can’t say what position the United States would take if they renew their motion to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.839" offset="5978676">We didn’t object before but I think that in line with Mr. Greenberg’s suggestion that what the Court should do in this case is just send it back to the District Court and allow the 72 elections to remain in effect while the same result can be accomplished simply by the provisions of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.338" offset="6052760">The other point I would like to make is that although appellants have said in their brief, “if we can’t intervene here, under what conceivable circumstances can anyone,” I think really misstates and misconceives the problem here because what they are contending for is intervention as of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.698" offset="6118170">There is always permissive intervention and that is a much a easier process to urge upon the Court because the only requirement is the claim that they have is as in common with a question of fact or law in the main action and that’s even if they have no right to intervene which is not our position in this case, it still leaves them the opportunity to seek permissive intervention.</text>
