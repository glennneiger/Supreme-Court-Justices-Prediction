            <text syncTime="27.940" offset="215124">Plaintiff’s appellants are black school-age children residing in Tunica County, Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.476" offset="245321">They filed this lawsuit in October of 1970 and they alleged and subsequently proved that they are attending public schools in Mississippi which were under Court order to desegregate under Alexander and under Green and that despite injunctive orders of the Northern District of Mississippi, the schools remained segregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.798" offset="354513">They alleged further that the school -- their schools are segregated because there exists the Tunica County Institute of Learning which is a private segregated and segregationist academy located in Tunica County.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.529" offset="425462">They alleged further and proved that this segregated Tunica Institute of Learning was under the laws of the State of Mississippi receiving free textbooks.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.091" offset="483767">And that this textbook aid to the Private Academy of Tunica County represented unlawful support of racial discrimination and assisted in undermining public school desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.814" offset="562657">They challenged the constitutionality of the Mississippi statute which required the distribution of such textbooks to the private academies of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.701" offset="610200">Essentially, our complaint is that the State has a duty to avoid aligning itself with racial discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="186.410" offset="849063">However, along that line, there was a significant change in regulations promulgated in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.996" offset="883336">As pointed out in the Government’s brief amicus curiae, the textbook purchasing board in 1970 in effect, adopted a regulation which made it possible for private segregated academies of Mississippi to receive textbooks directly from the State agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.627" offset="957837">Prior to 1970, a private academy depended upon a local school district to receive textbooks and under the Emergency School Assistance Act, such public school districts would lose federal money as they continue to provide textbooks to private academies and as a result, the State agency adopted a regulation which permitted, which indeed required that the private academies deal directly with the State textbook agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="621.122" offset="2587878">Whether the standard for reviewing state support of parochial schools is comparable to the standard for reviewing state support of racially segregated schools and we submit, of course, that the two amendments are substantially different and we can get to that immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.608" offset="2673768">The Chief Justice in Walz versus Tax Commission and I quote stated that, “an effort to interpret and understand the establishment or religion clauses of the First Amendment requires that we apply constitutional principles so as to serve,” and I quote, “ultimate constitutional objectives as illuminated by history.”</text>
            <text syncTime="668.166" offset="2776064">In Walz versus Tax Commission, the Court went on to quote Mr. Justice Douglas and said, “When the state encourages religious instruction, it follows the best of our traditions or then respects the religious nature of our people and accommodates the public service to their spiritual needs.”</text>
            <text syncTime="689.770" offset="2862477">In other words, under the First Amendment when we look at the history of the religion clauses, we find that their objective was not to eliminate any form of State aid for religious instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.098" offset="2931754">Instead, we find an internal tension or instead as the Court has observed, we walk a tight rope and we balance the establishment clause against the free exercise clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.986" offset="2983267">Recognize that in terms of our history, religion has served an important function and in terms of the religion clauses, we must strike the balance and protect the individual in his right, his First Amendment right to pursue his religious beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.285" offset="3056515">When we turn to the Fourteenth Amendment, Your Honor, we find instead a history marked by a commitment to the elimination of State support for racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.019" offset="3095489">This is the fundamental difference between any approach to aid in the context of the religion clauses and aid in the context of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.169" offset="3140002">We are as a people committed to recognizing the value of religion in American life.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.529" offset="3165497">At the same time, we are as a people and as a matter of constitutional principle, committed to the elimination of racial discrimination and the support of racial discrimination by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.474" offset="3213249">So, it is of no help to us in this case to refer as the District Court did to our First Amendment standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.357" offset="3240835">There are again in the words of the Chief Justice, in the Walz versus Tax Commission, ultimate constitutional objective as illuminated by history in the First Amendment which are diametrically opposed to objective as illuminated by history in the context of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.655" offset="3313977">The failure of the District Court to recognize this represents the basic fundamental error which we bring to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.693" offset="3354102">Again, along the same lines, we have since the enactment, the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.829" offset="3390673">In our very recent history have civil rights laws enacted by the Congress in 1957, in 1961, in 1964, in 1968 and 1965 and 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.832" offset="3438738">All of these legislations, all of the decisions of the Court since Cooper versus Aaron, since Brown versus Board of Education stand for the proposition that the constitutional objective as illuminated by history in the Fourteenth Amendment context is the elimination of any state support for racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.785" offset="3514493">When the State of Mississippi aligns itself by the provision of a half a million dollars to direct subsidy to private academies which discriminate on the basis of race, it has violated this historical -- the Fourteenth Amendment as illuminated by history.</text>

            <text syncTime="897.844" offset="3694738">In fact, when the statute was passed, we had an absolute dual school system in Mississippi, so the issue could never have arisen in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.196" offset="3732146">If anything we know that the legislature of Mississippi in 1942 provided textbook aid for segregated academies or for segregated schools, at that time they were public.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.605" offset="3773837">This was reminiscent of the problem faced in Brown versus Board of Education where we had no legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment which revealed the intention of Congress with regard to public education.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.066" offset="3831620">In fact, there was no public education, said the Court in Brown, at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.354" offset="3856802">And given that fact, the Court had to move to other considerations to determine whether there was a violation of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.780" offset="3882506">So, we have a statute passed in 1942 before the problem arose and the question of purpose cannot be pursued in the same way that we would pursue purpose with the specific facts available.</text>

            <text syncTime="976.184" offset="4008103">In 19 -- well, in 1942, we had a dual school system which was lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.453" offset="4033181">In 1972, we have a dual school system that is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.518" offset="4053452">Now, what is true, Your Honor, in terms of the statute and in terms of the black children of Mississippi and this reminiscent of a woman -- reminiscent of woman in power, It is of no consolation to the black children of Mississippi or the black population of Mississippi that the legislature in 1942 did not intend to promote segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.328" offset="4148642">The fact is, the effect of the statute is to promote segregation and that promotion of segregation is the gravamen of our complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.179" offset="4184064">It is of no consolation to the black children that the State does not intend to do something when the evil is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.679" offset="4218128">Now, again on this First Amendment or this religion issue versus the Fourteenth Amendment issue, in Green versus Kennedy, another three-judge District Court was faced with the problem of federal tax exemption benefits to the private academies of Mississippi, the same private academies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.219" offset="4320214">I remind the Court that a tax exemption was an indirect benefit to these private academies, there was significantly less support for racial discrimination in Mississippi’s textbook statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.198" offset="4376116">Here we have a direct grant of at least a half a million dollars, or a quarter of a million dollars annually and yet, the three judge District Court affirmed by this Court held that tax exemption is only minimal and remote involvement when compared to the kind of identification in support of religion prohibited by the establishment clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.347" offset="4460753">But the governmental and constitutional interest of avoiding racial discrimination in educational institutions embraces the interest to be -- or precludes even indirect economic benefit to racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.982" offset="4523342">Again, it’s juxtaposition of the requirements of the religion clauses versus the requirement of the equal protection clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.012" offset="4587395">We are of the clear view that the proper standard for reviewing State support for racially discriminatory educational institutions can be found in Cooper versus Aaron.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.100" offset="4647790">There, this Court held that State support for racial discrimination through any arrangement, through any management or any fund is violative of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.484" offset="4705259">When the State of Mississippi provides textbook aid and places itself behind the racial discrimination, and in effect or in fact incurred this racial discrimination, it violates Cooper versus Aaron.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.603" offset="4757817">And our second basic theory is that under the principles of Green versus New Kent County, Virginia, the State has an affirmative duty to promote racially integrated education, that given its support for racial discrimination in the dual school system in the past, it is duty bound today to remove itself entirely from racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.629" offset="4845902">Indeed, it has a duty to quarantine racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.451" offset="4865128">Anything less than that would be violative of Green versus New Kent County, Virginia.</text>
