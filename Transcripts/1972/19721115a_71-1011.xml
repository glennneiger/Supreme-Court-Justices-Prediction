            <text syncTime="15.778" offset="166536">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.940" offset="199137">Petitioner was convicted on one count of perjury under the federal perjury statute, 18 USC 1621.</text>

            <text syncTime="45.311" offset="284609">The conviction was affirmed in a split decision of the Circuit, two-to-one.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.153" offset="315956">Now, the facts are quite simple and I will put them briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.843" offset="350751">The perjury arose out of interrogation in a hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="73.452" offset="397145">The hearing was in a Bankruptcy Court before a referee in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.312" offset="424626">The questioning was done by an attorney for one of the creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.108" offset="447822">The examination was under Section 21 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="92.066" offset="471646">Now, the petitioner had a company.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.353" offset="480737">He was the sole stockholder and the president.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.340" offset="496724">The company had filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.755" offset="530369">The purpose of the 21 (a) examination was to inquire into assets of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.594" offset="557746">Because of the petitioner’s relation to the company as president and sole stockholder, creditors and their counsel were entitled, if they so chose, to ask about his personal assets, and there is no dispute on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.557" offset="637576">Late in the afternoon of the examination, four questions were asked which are the subject of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.405" offset="672998">They are set forth at page 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.048" offset="691597">Two commercial questions were: Question: “do you have any bank accounts in Swiss Banks, Mr. Brontson?</text>
            <text syncTime="156.722" offset="730258">Answer: “No, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="159.348" offset="740812">Question: “have you ever?”</text>
            <text syncTime="162.176" offset="752097">Answer: “the company had an account there for about six months in Zurich.”</text>
            <text syncTime="169.474" offset="781249">The last two questions related to nominee accounts and they’re of no further consequence here.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.509" offset="817403">The government did not dispute the truthfulness of either of these answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.620" offset="845824">Mr. Bronston had had a personal bank account in Geneva, and the prosecution proceeded on the theory that he committed perjury by not saying so in answer to the second question, “have you ever?”</text>
            <text syncTime="205.963" offset="927222">Now, it was undisputed that the account had been closed some-two years before the questioning took place and that it had been dormant for some-four years before the questioning took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.790" offset="998484">There were no assets in the account and there had not been any assets beyond an insignificant amount since 1962, some-four years before the questioning, some-two years before the company filed its petition for an arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.379" offset="1088867">Although the accounts asked about-- the account asked about were in Switzerland, these were not numbered-- this was not a numbered account.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.536" offset="1133484">It was in Mr. Bronston’s name.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.535" offset="1145501">It was opened in an ordinary commercial transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.429" offset="1161070">His company did business in Switzerland.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.060" offset="1171623">It was an international company that did business all over the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.580" offset="1189700">He had a child in a school in Switzerland.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.066" offset="1207672">He drew checks on this account and he signed them with his name.</text>

            <text syncTime="534.238" offset="2240345">Either the question “have you ever?” was ambiguous, in which case there should’ve been questioning to spell the ambiguity but there was not perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.869" offset="2298859">It was ambiguous because if a company executive is asked “how many cars did you manufactured in June, Mr. Ford?”</text>
            <text syncTime="558.209" offset="2336162">The word “you” applies to a company, “how long have you been driving?” applies to an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.146" offset="2367927">“Do you have any bank accounts in Switzerland or have you had any bank accounts in Switzerland?” could apply to either, and this is particularly true in a context of an American bankruptcy of an international company because the assets in Switzerland or other foreign jurisdictions would not be under the jurisdiction in the American Bankruptcy Court, and creditors may very well have chosen to inquire into company accounts abroad so that they might seek some form of ansulary of bankruptcy.</text>

            <text syncTime="601.486" offset="2509302">A creditor may have chosen to go into Switzerland, and that’s another reason, Mr. Chief Justice, when I say it’s not all that clear that this was an evasive answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.769" offset="2550471">Judge Lumbard proceeded on the assumption that he must have been talking about a personal account, but when you reflect upon the problems of international bankruptcies of companies with assets all over the world, it’s not unreasonable to believe that the witness thought he was being asked about the company’s accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.612" offset="2625808">He asked- he answered about the company’s accounts and if the question meant personal, he could’ve said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.417" offset="2657050">But, if we assume, as Judge Lumbard said, that it was not ambiguous but was directed to a personal account, then the questioner could not have been put off.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.579" offset="2709713">It was patently unresponsive.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.667" offset="2718072">It was about a company account, and that raises then the second question of whether a truthful and clearly unresponsive answer should be the basis for a criminal conviction of perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.653" offset="2789961">Now, there’s that second question which, I think, raises the most intriguing conceptual problems and which the Court may very well wish to ask more questions about, but I have chosen to argue first the question of ambiguity for the purpose of the clarity of the argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="1865.972" offset="7567235">The central issue in this case is whether a witness who knowingly, willfully, and with the intent to deceive and conceal give sworn testimony which, considered in the context in which it was given, constitutes a falsehood by implication can escape punishment for perjury on the ground that the words that he uttered were literally or technically truthful when considered in isolation.</text>

Judge Taney’s charge to the jury was, we believe, a model of clarity and of precision, and we have set forth the relevant portions of it in appendix B to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.485" offset="7749360">Judge Taney made it quite clear to the jury that they had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the petitioner understood the question, that his response to the question was not inaccurate as a result of haste, inadvertence, misunderstanding, confusion, negligence, or any honest error on his part.</text>

            <text syncTime="1978.867" offset="8018840">That’s what the jury found, because the judge instructed them apart from the question of understanding that they must find that he made a statement which, when considered in the entire context, was a false statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2043.065" offset="8275675">Basically, petitioner’s arguments fall into two categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.315" offset="8288632">The one group of arguments for those that say the case should never have gone to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.231" offset="8308276">The second group are those that say all of these may be true, what the jury found may be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.764" offset="8330428">It may be true that this was a lie by negative implication, but that’s not enough as a matter of law, and the judge was in error when he charged that technical truthfulness is not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.518" offset="8373478">I’d like to take up first the ambiguity point that Mr. Elsen discussed, which is basically a question of whether it was proper to submit this issue to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.538" offset="8421543">Now, I point out that, in addition to the jury, none of the judges below had the least difficulty with this contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.074" offset="8451636">They were all satisfied that the word “you,” as used in the context of these questions, at least called for information about petitioner’s personal accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.008" offset="8499388">Now in our view, looking at the context of the proceeding, it was logical to assume that it called for information about both personal and corporate accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.472" offset="8541288">But, in any event, we do not believe that it can be construed as calling for information only about his corporate accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.307" offset="8568560">I think, perhaps I can illustrate that point for you by hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.340" offset="8584756">Suppose the company had had no accounts in Switzerland at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.641" offset="8601893">There had been only petitioner’s personal account, and he had been asked these very questions that he was asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.024" offset="8627493">And, in response to the question “have you ever had a Swiss Bank account?” he had simply answered no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.331" offset="8656645">Now, I don’t think it could seriously be contended that that response would’ve been non-perjurious in view of the existence of his personal Geneva account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.627" offset="8697919">Yet, if the ambiguity argument, as a matter of law, holds water then that response-- the question was still unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.796" offset="8730520">You couldn’t go to the jury even if he had said no in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.874" offset="8750895">And, I think if you look at the context of this proceeding and of the questions, there was evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer that the word “you” referred to petitioner’s personal accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.821" offset="8818604">First of all, there’s the word in even the question itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.227" offset="8828322">In normal meaning of those questions, it seems to me, is that “you” is “you, Mr. Bronston.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.216" offset="8860191">Now, petitioner says “well, but this was a bankruptcy arrangement proceeding for Mr. Bronston’s onus corporation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.518" offset="8893419">That’s true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.489" offset="8901360">However, the nature of this proceeding is one in which the creditors are trying to discover in marshal the assets of the company in order to be sure that the creditors’ claims are going to be satisfied that there’s been no improper diversion of company assets into friends or into the personal hands of the whole-- sole owner of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.012" offset="8999372">So, it’s highly material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.270" offset="9004492">It’s not just material as a technical matter, but it’s highly material to the bankruptcy inquiry to determine petitioner’s individual finances to see whether there is money that is in his personal possession which properly belongs to the corporation and should be reachable by the creditors as part of the arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.990" offset="9087352">Now, the evidence-- in this case, the account had been closed and it has never been established that there was bankruptcy fraud by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.911" offset="9143045">However, on the--in the setting of this situation, I think it’s quite clear that the questions were addressed to his personal account.</text>

            <text syncTime="2351.535" offset="9509491">There was some evidence that the government sought to introduce regarding an unexplained series of transactions involving a $25-payment from the company to Lichtenstein Corporation or the Dorchester Establishment which, five weeks after, paid $20,000 into this personal Geneva account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.963" offset="9583261">Now, that evidence was introduced and was before the jury when Mr. Elsen sought to rebut that evidence by putting an explanatory evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.074" offset="9619623">There was a conference at the bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.082" offset="9631744">As a result of which, the matter was dropped and the government did not argue to the jury, and I can’t say to you that there was any impropriety in this transaction, but what I can say is that it’s very possible that Mr. Bronston thought there was something about that account that he didn’t want these people snooping into.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.690" offset="9706141">There was a substantial account, $180,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="2411.542" offset="9749504">Now, we will agree that there are circumstances in which a question can be so ambiguous that, as a matter of law, you can’t ask the jury to find whether the defendant understood the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3011.191" offset="12148172">I think that one can readily see that literal truthfulness should not be a total defense to a perjury charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.759" offset="12186415">From the example of the question “who was at the meeting of June 1?” and the response “Smith and Brown,” when in fact, Jones and Robinson were also at the meeting, now, the response “Smith and Brown” is literally truthful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.921" offset="12239078">You could’ve of course asked another question, “anyone else?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.892" offset="12254960">But, the response “Smith and Brown” in the context can suggest that that’s a total answer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3052.659" offset="12313997">That’s right, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and I think that I will concede that the inquiry here was not the most skillful that one can imagine, but the question is whether the witness who has spoken falsely should be relieved of the onus of his offense by virtue of the inaptitude of counsel asking the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.757" offset="12414412">This witness understood what the question called for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.017" offset="12427473">He gave an answer which was designed to and which did convey false information, denying the existence of a Swiss Bank account.</text>

            <text syncTime="3116.925" offset="12571042">I mean, that would’ve been a completely satisfactory and non-perjurious answer and would’ve put the ball back in the court of the person asking the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.890" offset="12606882">Instead, he chose to answer in a manner which applied the non-existence of this personal Geneva account.</text>

            <text syncTime="3210.880" offset="12946892">This was information that Mr. Bronston knew of, and Mr. Bronston was, therefore, in a position where he could much more easily mislead the inquiry than you would be at a trial where of course, in many cases, the lawyers already know the information and their problem is to bring it, develop it for the fact-finder.</text>

            <text syncTime="3297.192" offset="13292126">In my example with the persons at the meeting where the answer “Smith and Brown,” which I believe petitioner concedes as perjurious in that context, although I think Judge Lumbard would not find it to be, you would agree that all you have to do is ask anyone else and you could’ve bring out the rest of that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.968" offset="13379271">Yet, the answer suggests no one else, and if the answer stands, no one else is the answer to which the witness is held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.065" offset="13407587">Now, the difference in the example the petitioner has used in his reply brief is, he says that if the answer had been “Smith and Jones were the Blacks at the meeting,” that would not be perjurious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.437" offset="13461086">We agree that will not be perjurious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.139" offset="13471953">The example is inapt, however, for the reason that the statement “Smith and Jones were the Blacks at the meeting” carries with it no implication denying presence of other persons at the meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.847" offset="13518764">On the contrary, it implies that there were other people at the meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.051" offset="13539558">Now, if this answer had implied that there were other bank accounts, we wouldn’t be here today because we would agree that there would be no perjury charge to submit to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.999" offset="13579368">If this answer had been completely unresponsive like the daughter going to school in Switzerland, there would be no negative implication, no false statement contained.</text>

            <text syncTime="3390.537" offset="13665468">The opinion of the Second Circuit speaks about the whole truth principle of the oath and, in a footnote, they stated “it may be the duce from these orders and forms in the purposes of the Act that an oath given in a bankruptcy proceeding basically takes the same form and has the same legal consequences as an oath composed of the traditional words of “truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3422.681" offset="13794095">I have been advised by Referee Ryan that the form of oath that he uses is an oath as follows: “do you swear that the evidence that you shall give in this proceeding shall be the truth, so help you God?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.766" offset="13846444">Now, therefore, the Court was wrong in surmising that the-- in form, the oath contained an explicit reference to the whole truth principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.728" offset="13886255">In our view, however, this makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.675" offset="13894092">When a witness takes his oath to take the truth, he’s bound to tell the truth, and we say Mr. Bronston didn’t do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.756" offset="13930350">On closing, it’s our contention that petitioner’s position would constitute an open invitation to the clever witness seeking to conceal the truth, to engage in half-true evasive and deceptive answers, in short, to subvert the integrity of the fact-finding process within impunity so long as he can be literally or technically truthful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.558" offset="14017599">The principle that the Court lays down in this case will not apply solely to bankruptcy proceedings because we’re engaged in an interpretation of federal perjury statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.743" offset="14058350">A reversal of petitioner’s conviction would suggest that the same source of deceit and falsehood by negative implication that would go unpunished here could be resorted to by a witness in a criminal case where a man’s liberty may be at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.192" offset="14112162">We don’t believe it’s too much for the sake of the integrity of the federal fact-finding process to require witnesses to be truthful not just in the narrow technical sense, but the literal meaning of their words, but in the broader sense of the true meaning of the words and in the true context in which they are uttered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.786" offset="14174542">Accordingly, we submit the conviction should be affirmed.</text>
