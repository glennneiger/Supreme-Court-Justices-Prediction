            <label>Mr. Stanley Fleishman</label>
            <text syncTime="39.718" offset="262248">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.186" offset="284087">Petitioner, Murry Kaplan, a bookseller, has been branded by the State of California as a criminal for selling a book, a sexy book, to an adult who asked for a good sexy book.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.494" offset="373321">For doing so Mr. Kaplan has been placed under probation for three years on condition that he’d spend 30 days in jail and that he pay a fine of $1,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.886" offset="438941">Initially, I would like to point out what is not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.501" offset="461406">We do not have, in this case, any issue of sale to or exhibition to minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.989" offset="491290">We do not have, in this case, any upfront to the sensibilities of adults or anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.062" offset="527653">We have no shock.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.862" offset="534862">We have no fighting words.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.738" offset="546356">We have, to put it simply, pure communication, a sale of a book to an adult.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.125" offset="591914">The facts are not in dispute at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.470" offset="605288">On May 14, 1969, Mr. Donald Schidel, a police officer with 16.5 years of experience, came to petitioner’s bookshop.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.118" offset="659832">It’s an adult bookshop.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.054" offset="667564">There were some-250 of them in the City of Los Angeles at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.587" offset="689716">Mr. Schidel was browsing around for about 30 or 40 minutes when the petitioner said “this is not a library.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.966" offset="723257">Can I help you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="156.978" offset="731303">It was at that point where Mr. Schidel said “Do you have any good sexy books?” and petitioner said “all our books are sexy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="167.348" offset="772786">Then he said “I want a good paperback book, something really good.”</text>
            <text syncTime="172.861" offset="794833">Petitioner said, “hey, I’m reading one now, Suite 69” and he read him a portion of pages 84 and 85 which I may say, parenthetically, are pale.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.519" offset="841435">The words are pale by comparison to Henry Miller’s “Topic of Cancer” found not obscene by this Court a long time ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.980" offset="879261">After reading the passages to the officer, he parted for $1.69-- $1.95, and that’s the entire transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.814" offset="918653">Now, from the beginning, the petitioner here urged that his conduct could not be punished constitutionally, that he didn’t do anything that offended the state in any fashion by selling this book to this adult under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.654" offset="1009977">Our basic claim here, Your Honors, is one that has, not to my knowledge, been posed quite this way before although, certainly, we have posed it differently on other occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.999" offset="1071417">Our claim here is that an adult in America has an absolute right, and I know that absolute rights are not many but I believe that this is one of the few absolute rights that we have, an absolute right to read anything he wants to read even if it has no social value, even if it appeals to the prurient interest of the average person, and even if it may be thought to be patently offensive by others.</text>

            <text syncTime="283.685" offset="1238079">My client claims a derivative right.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.140" offset="1247901">We say that if in fact an adult has this absolute right to read, then the bookseller has the right to assert the right to read in exactly the same fashion that Mr. Baird was given standing to assert the right of the unmarried woman who wanted to obtain a contraceptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.448" offset="1337135">We do not claim that petitioner or bookseller has the right to sell an obscene book.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.670" offset="1366079">That fact is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.194" offset="1372139">We do say, however, that the right to read would be meaningless unless the bookseller, when he is charged criminally, can come before the Court and say “this, you cannot do because you are interfering with the right of an adult to read if you punish me, the bookseller, for selling to an adult.”</text>

            <text syncTime="363.352" offset="1556773">I mean, in other words, your client was not convicted for reading anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="377.297" offset="1612570">I have thought further, I believe, in the sense that I have struck this case, at least my argument, differently than we did in Reidel.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.345" offset="1656769">In Reidel, we asserted the right of Mr. Reidel to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.217" offset="1676204">He had the constitutional right to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.581" offset="1685713">I come here now and say I know that Mr. Kaplan does not have a constitutional right to sell an obscene book, but I do say that the book seller has standing to assert the right of the reader.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.092" offset="1747780">There is nothing in Reidel at all that is in conflict with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.107" offset="1763767">As a matter of fact, I believe that on a close reading, Justice White, of Reidel, you told us that we didn’t pose it at our argument correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.200" offset="1804204">As I read it, you did state that there was an independent right there, but we haven’t claimed the correct right in Reidel.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.598" offset="1845791">At least that’s my reading of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.791" offset="1854568">I do not believe there is anything in Reidel that stands in the way of our prevailing in this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.099" offset="1887796">The result may be very close to the same, but we certainly are walking in a different door and that is what I am talking about at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.606" offset="1925831">I don’t think there is any way of avoiding the result that we claim here once we agree as to a proposition that there can be no disagreement about it, and that is that an adult simply has this absolute right to read.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.565" offset="2005661">It’s not only in our constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.021" offset="2015483">It’s not only in the cases that this Court has decided on enumerable occasions but it is, if you will, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which has been with us now for some-25 years, passed in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.272" offset="2096462">Article XIX of that Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.871" offset="2138885">This right includes freedom to uphold opinions without interference and to seek, receive information and ideas through any medium.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.210" offset="2184234">Now--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>

            <text syncTime="537.377" offset="2252884">Well, California is simply saying in this case that the medium, that is the store and I’m not now speaking of the book, the store operating as it was operating violates California’s laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.995" offset="2307323">Is that correct?</text>

          <turn speaker="stanley_fleishman" startTime="559.273" stopTime="675.308">
            <label>Mr. Stanley Fleishman</label>
            <text syncTime="559.273" offset="2340446">This-- it would violate the statute if the statute would give in the broad reach that the state has claimed for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.676" offset="2366046">What we say here, though, is that that broad reach is simply impermissible because it does not trench upon any state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.109" offset="2403767">The only state interest that have ever been articulated by this Court with regard to the suppression of obscenity are really two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.524" offset="2445458">One is the legitimate concern with minors, and the other is the legitimate with concern with the privacy of the general public so that the general public is not shocked or affronted by obscenity because it is the fact that this kind of communication of very explicit sexual material can cause shock in very much the same way as the words in Chaplinsky were thought to be fighting words, or in very much the same way that the words in Boe Harneigh were thought to be offensive to the sensitivities of the persons who heard them but, once we leave that, there simply is no state interest in telling a person that he cannot read an obscene book.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.298" offset="2640541">That’s my understanding of what Your Honor said in Reidel, Mr. Justice White, where, as I read it, there was the statement that Stanley recognized an independent constitutional right, independent of the First Amendment, a constitutional right to read what one wanted, whether one talks of this in terms of the numbers that come from the first, the fourth, and the ninth, or however one wants to articulate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.857" offset="2762794">We do state that the California just simple does not have constitutional power to interfere as far as it has in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="675.308" offset="2804590">Mr. Fleishman, if we said in Roth that obscenity as such as not protected by the First Amendment, why need the state to show what you call a state interest in order-- if it’s dealing with what is arguably obscene.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stanley Fleishman</label>
            <text syncTime="691.006" offset="2867388">Well-- because, Your Honor, and this really is the heart of my argument that even though obscenity is not speech and, therefore, is not protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, even so, an adult has the right to read obscenity and this right to read, even obscenity, is a fundamental personal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.286" offset="2956518">Therefore, if the state wants to interfere with the fundamental personal right to read even an obscene book, then the state must show a compelling reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="725.352" offset="3004792">Well, then you’re saying that what we said in Roth isn’t entirely correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.772" offset="3030497">If a person has a right to read an obscene book, presumably that right stems from the First Amendment as incorporating by the Fourteenth.</text>

            <text syncTime="741.488" offset="3069367">I think that’s what Mr. Justice White was teaching, me at least, in Reidel, that there is a right to read but it is not a First Amendment right to read and, therefore, it’s an independently safe right.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.031" offset="3127463">There are certain things, for example, I suppose I have the right, a fundamental constitutional right, to go out and enjoy a sunset, to enjoy that.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.564" offset="3177618">That’s a fundamental right that I have.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.080" offset="3183679">Now, that’s not a First Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.457" offset="3189217">It’s a personal right that comes to me as a human being in terms of the importance of liberty, and the state simply cannot interfere with that right without showing some legitimate state interest, an the legitimate state interest must be a compelling interest where you have fundamental rights at stake.</text>

            <text syncTime="815.100" offset="3363819">It’s a distinction that was drawn in Baird.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.586" offset="3373746">It’s the distinction that is present in Stanley and it’s the distinction that we claim here, that there are personal fundamental rights that simply stand on a higher footing than merely economic rights or social rights which do not come on into this same level.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.925" offset="3443022">When you said in Griswold that there is a right of privacy, marital privacy, which is fundamental and the state can only intrude in that in limited area and upon the showing of a compelling interest, it was because there was a finding that that situation was of great importance in a free society, and I’m saying the right to think and all that’s embodied in that is fundamental to a free society.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.164" offset="3564022">You cannot-- you simply cannot have a democratic society without giving and recognizing the importance of the right to read anything that an adult wants to read.</text>

            <text syncTime="927.485" offset="3813334">Now, in that case, the right belonged to the unmarried woman, but the person who asserted the right was Mr. Baird who had given it to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.504" offset="3845413">Now, in this case, the right that I claim, the constitutional right that is inherent here in this case is the adult person’s right to read.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.147" offset="3879999">But, the bookseller, the person who makes that right meaningful is in a position to assert that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.734" offset="3906330">He has standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.326" offset="3912704">He has standing for better reasons than Baird was given standing in the Baird case because, in Baird, the Court said unless Mr. Baird could assert the right that was involved, the right would fall into this too.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.381" offset="3972890">It would wither away.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.389" offset="3980936">Now, in our case in California there is no crime of reading an obscene book.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.517" offset="4005491">Therefore, there would never be a situation where the adult could assert.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.919" offset="4027016">He would have no form in which to assert his right and, under those circumstances, this Court has said that you—the third party rule, the rule of asserting third party rights can be relaxed and should be relaxed, and that is exactly what we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.437" offset="4101099">We do not say, and I want to repeat it, we do not say that the bookseller has an independent right to distribute an obscene book.</text>

            <text syncTime="1042.690" offset="4274134">I would-- before leaving this, if the Court please, I would like to point out that as I understand it, every member of the Court really has accepted the right of the adult to read obscenity privately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.989" offset="4351352">If I understand Rosenfelt correctly, Mr. Justice Powell there stated that our free society had to be flexible enough to permit adults to engage their tastes which would include obscene talk privately, but the condition was that that obscene talk not be such as to intrude upon those who are unwilling to engage in this kind of talk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.025" offset="4463470">Inherent in and explicitly stated in Rosenfelt was that there was the right of an individual to exercise their own taste in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.518" offset="4513416">It’s something we all know, this distinction between the public and the private, a joke which is perfectly proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.532" offset="4545494">It may be an obscene joke, perfectly proper in a fraternity house or in a locker room is perfectly improper when its either public or perhaps in this quadroon because it becomes an offense, but if you had the situation which we have in this case, whether it simply is no offense to anyone, then so far as this aspect of the case is concerned there is the absolute right to read which then does depend on standing as Your Honor did state before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.668" offset="4674017">But, there are other aspects to the case which do not depend on standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.810" offset="4690631">First of all, once we leave the first point, we believe that the book is not obscene under the variable obscenity test even if it meets the three-pronged tests set forth by this Court in memoires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.440" offset="4769102">That is to say a book which is sold to a consenting adult under controlled circumstances, such as we have here, simply is not patently offensive because it’s one thing if you have a mass mailing, such as was involved in Roth in the first instance or again in Ginsberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.304" offset="4852590">There, because it goes out indiscriminately, it’s going to be offensive to large numbers of persons, and then you do have to ask the question “is it patently offensive to this large group of people who are exposed to it?” but it’s irrelevant, it seems to me, when you have a situation where if I choose to buy the book and read the book and it doesn’t offend me, then it doesn’t matter that that same book would offend most other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.617" offset="4965857">The other people don’t buy it, don’t read it and, therefore, whether it does or does not offend them is simply irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.953" offset="4995218">The same thing is true with regard to the appeal to the current interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.971" offset="5011205">Now, the appeal to the prurient interest of the average person makes sense when you have, again, a widespread distribution to a large number of persons so you have to then strike the group that is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.021" offset="5067421">But, when you have a private transaction such as you have here, it simply doesn’t matter that it may appeal to the prurient interest of the average person if it does not appeal to the prurient interest of the person who reads it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.194" offset="5116113">This is only the other side really of Mishkin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.211" offset="5128234">In Mishkin, Your Honor stated that it was proper to adjust the test depending upon the audience for whom it is prepared and the primarily distributed to and, there, material which would have been perhaps not obscene if it was to the average person was found to be obscene because it was geared for a particular group where we’d have a particular impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.308" offset="5220603">Now, I’m looking at the other side of that coin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.171" offset="5232097">If all we have are consenting adults, people who are not offended, people who do not have their prurient interest appealed to by the reading of this, people for whom it does have value even if it would not have value generally, then that book to that person under those circumstances simply is not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.916" offset="5319032">For that argument, Mr. Justice Blackmun, of course, we do not require to go on a standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.916" offset="5343065">That’s an independent right because the bookseller has an independent right to sell the book now because, on this argument, the book is not obscene under a variable obscenity test, and--</text>

            <text syncTime="1340.701" offset="5466154">The third part of the argument, insofar as this is concerned, is that aside from everything else, if we forget the variable obscenity test, if we forget the right o read, this book is simply not obscene under cases already decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.369" offset="5544835">The book, after all, is words alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.744" offset="5562389">It has no pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.153" offset="5575973">In terms of the words used, they surely are no stronger, no starker than the words that are Henry Miller’s book and in noise complaint and all around us, as far as that’s concerned, and in terms of the descriptions that are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.548" offset="5645563">There comes a time, I would respectfully submit, that there’s nothing new that you can say about the subject, and that time has simply come and gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.528" offset="5689448">So that, in every aspect of the case, the book, it seems to me, cannot be the basis of a criminal conviction such as was involved here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1432.286" offset="5832495">It seems to me that all petitioner wants in this case is that this Court should scuttle Roth and 15 years of cases following Roth including Reidel, including 37 photographs which are less than a year-and-a half since they were decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.619" offset="5897801">Now, petitioner perceived something in Stanley versus Georgia which this Court has held already does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.558" offset="5933641">His arguments already been presented to the California Supreme Court in People versus Burrows, and they considered his argument to be highly concatenated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.766" offset="5974392">If I understand him correctly, he is saying, number one, it’s alright to sell obscenity to a consenting adult and, number two, if you sell it to a consenting adult, it’s not obscene and, number three, he asserts that Roth is still the law of the land and obscenity is still not protected and he says he doesn’t challenge Roth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.769" offset="6066448">To me, this is somewhat confusing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.345" offset="6076792">Now, there are some facts in this case which Mr. Fleishman didn’t stress which I feel should be stressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.979" offset="6103333">I think the conversation in the bookstore between the officer and petitioner was a little more involved than what Mr. Fleishman has stated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.348" offset="6140740">It’s all covered in detail in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.871" offset="6158817">I think this case is unusual in the sense that commercial exploitation exists in this case to a much greater degree, at least in the record, than it has in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.941" offset="6211166">I think it’s invalid for Mr. Fleishman to argue to this Court that obscenity today in the United States is not being thrust on an unwilling public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.155" offset="6247946">The fact of the matter is that the public is complaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.324" offset="6260694">The public did complain, according to the record, about Mr. Kaplan and that’s why the police went there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.333" offset="6288697">At the time this case arose, there was some-250, I call them dirty bookstores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.523" offset="6313462">If Mr. Fleishman wants to call them adult bookstores, okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.331" offset="6328717">There are 250 in the City of Los Angeles alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.473" offset="6345226">There just are not enough policemen assigned to the bike squad to cover the dirty bookstores in all the other parts of their assignment for them to go around aggressively enforcing the laws against pornography, and the record shows that the only reason they went to Mr. Kaplan’s bookstore was because they have received complaints from the public and complaints from governmental people to whom the public had complained.</text>

            <text syncTime="1921.696" offset="7790111">It says the purpose was to investigate citizens’ complaints regarding obscene matter being sold at that location and, later on, either board or cross examination was brought out that the complaints came to him via a City Councilman’s Office and the people had apparently complained to the City Councilman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.978" offset="7871300">Going on with this point, I think it’s interesting to note in the Los Angeles Times Sunday past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.306" offset="7896586">There was an article.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.193" offset="7900139">Apparently, the people are sorry that they’ve gone ahead and allowed the public distribution of pornography there because it has become a nuisance that there’s a danger of it becoming here in the United States and in California, in Los Angeles in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.604" offset="7973804">Now, Mr. Fleishman’s theory on its face, I think, has some sort of validity, that is, it would seem reasonable that one could control sales to minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.593" offset="8025736">There is a possibility of the chilling effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.935" offset="8039111">There’s a possibility of the prior restraint though if the state attempts to license bookstores and place them in the same manner that it does with alcohol.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.846" offset="8078712">Of course, with alcohol, you can never have a problem with prior restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.245" offset="8096371">The reason the theory doesn’t work is, very simply, if an adult goes into a liquor store and buys a bottle of bourbon, he certainly is not going to give it away to children and, most times, he’s not even going to give it away to other adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.062" offset="8139630">He’s buying it to consume it himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.705" offset="8150183">Once he has drunk it all up, it’s gone and he throws away an empty bottle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.281" offset="8164498">It’s not the same thing with pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.987" offset="8175365">It doesn’t self-destruct in five seconds and it’s not biodegradable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.089" offset="8191770">It simply sits there until he throws it in his trash and then you have the problem of redistribution because there is control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.149" offset="8223953">There are controls now in the area of pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.594" offset="8237746">You don’t have much of a redistribution problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.610" offset="8249762">I anticipate Mr. Fleishman will mention Butler versus Michigan, and I don’t want anybody to think that I’m implying that that’s bad law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.648" offset="8277974">I think it’s good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.445" offset="8285184">But, still in all, it goes to the validity of his argument that it should be okay if petitioner does not sell it to children because the fact of the matter is that if you have wider distribution, it means wider distribution everywhere eventually.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.610" offset="8353834">The other factual area in this case that was important to me was that petitioner was exploiting his materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.868" offset="8386853">He sold to the police on two different occasions three different types of material: film, photo magazine, and a book.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.786" offset="8422484">Petitioner was charged with all three-in-one complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.315" offset="8432619">He was tried in one case and the jury was shown what Mr. Fleishman calls comparables.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.283" offset="8460518">In the case of Suite 69, an entire book called “Adam and Eve,” held not obscene by this Court in White versus Minnesota was read to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.260" offset="8496462">The jury was instructed that they should consider the fact that this Court held Adam and Eve to be not obscene in considering whether or not Suite 69 was obscene and the jury, considering all the different comparables and all the factors in the case, acquitted petitioner of selling an obscene movie, of selling an obscene photo magazine and yet held, based on what they had heard, that the book is obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.194" offset="8616103">The manner in which petitioner and other pornography peddlers in this country are selling their materials these days, I think, speaks volumes for its social value and I would question whether a jury trial has any validity in an obscenity case if the petitioner can eventually come to this Court and say “well, the jury while having all the benefit of all that testimony and evidence should now be overruled because of some different standard.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.435" offset="8737102">If Stanley versus Georgia has any meaning, if Reidel and 37 Photographs have any meaning, and if they mean what Mr. Fleishman says they mean, then I am truly confounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.717" offset="8790288">I think the basic rule of Roth is still good.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.614" offset="8805857">I’m frankly surprised that a case such as Stanley versus Georgia ever had to come to this Court, it would seem to me that any Sixth Grade child would’ve told the police in Georgia that you can’t control a man as such and he wouldn’t have had to base it on the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.737" offset="8878268">I don’t think and I submit that this Court should not think so either, that because there is any right to think and an absolute right to read what you want in the privacy of your own home that that means there’s a right to sell pornography, and there isn’t any logical connection between Stanley’s right to read and petitioner’s right, on the other hand, to conduct a public merchandising of the material that Stanley might want to read.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.903" offset="9003029">Roth and Reidel simply do not agree with Stanley.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.666" offset="9018075">I do not believe that birth control cases are controlling in this case either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.544" offset="9037511">In the birth control cases, in Griswold and Eisenstadt, the Court was dealing with dissemination of ideas and information which the public at large clearly attaches great social value too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.981" offset="9095293">Pornography simply is not a matter that so fundamentally affects the people in this country as decisions of whether or not they should keep their children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.649" offset="9157987">What petitioner is saying in this case essentially is that the Court should throw out Roth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.382" offset="9180871">He is saying that there-- that Roth was wrong when it said there was no need for the state to show a clear and present danger based on any compelling state interest, and he says that this Court has limited the state only to interest in Stanley versus Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.817" offset="9258611">Now, the Court gave two examples in Stanley versus Georgia, but didn’t place any limit on what this compelling state interest may be, if any, and I think it’s up to the legislature and not the Courts to determine if the interest exists and, if so, what they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.667" offset="9334053">I would point out that acceptance of petitioners here in this case would put a place on the burden on the prosecution the same as it is now, and yet they’d be involved with the issues of where pornography was being sold to children or to consenting adults, and I suggest that this lies in the face of Ginsberg versus New York and Butler versus Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.564" offset="9441677">Some other issues that were raised in petitioner’s brief I would like to address very briefly, number one is the question of the national standards versus state standards or other local standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.065" offset="9483682">I see no compelling reason why the states should be denied local control over all aspects of obscenity, and I see no compelling reason why a national standard of contemporary community standard should apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="3003.311" offset="12116616">That’s right, but just briefly, if I may, I think that the obscenity of Suite 69 is clear from reading it and the jury’s judgment here was based on comparable evidence which this Court had considered previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.702" offset="12186206">It’s obviously different from other books.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.642" offset="12193938">There is no way that the community standards could not be violated because nothing can go further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.243" offset="12216299">To say the book is not obscene is to say that no book without pictures, in other words a written novel type book, could be obscene and that there are no community standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.464" offset="12261230">It would be nice for Mr. Fleishman and myself if this Court could decide whether social importance is an element that the prosecution has to prove as part of its case or whether or not it’s just part of the definition that’s stated in Roth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.364" offset="12340851">It seems to me that Roth created somewhat of a presumption that if the other elements of obscenity were met and social value is presumed not to exist, the California Court, the Court below, interpreted that not to be the law and followed the minority opinion in Memoirs in a Book versus Attorney General as it also followed the so-called pondering aspects of that book.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.149" offset="12451924">I submit that if this Court could say that a book such as Fanny held might be considered obscene under certain circumstances of sale then, certainly, that book being very tamed compared to Suite 69, certainly Suite 69 and the circumstances under which it was sold does have to be considered obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.055" offset="12543561">I think that there would-- that this really isn’t a question of pondering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.048" offset="12559548">The Court below did not talk about Ginsberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.417" offset="12569057">It talked about a Book versus Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.668" offset="12586088">Ginsberg couldn’t have been convicted under California law because you can’t prove the other elements of obscenity by the statements of the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.723" offset="12618271">You can only prove social value that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.892" offset="12638960">I think that the opinion of the Court below shows they didn’t rely on the California statute, but if this Court thinks they did, I would point out that its appearance is, to me at least, is that of a rule of evidence that codifies the law that was set forth in opinions coming from this Court long before petitioner was arrested, and it did become effective as a statute in Los Angeles quite a long time before he was actually tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.767" offset="12750451">It didn’t change any prior law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.954" offset="12763199">Therefore, I would submit under the facts of this case that the judgment should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3193.239" offset="12876361">Yes, sir, I would.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.240" offset="12880332">I think that stand on exactly the same footing, the right to get information whether one gets it by words or by picture stands on the same point, Mr. Justice Powell, in my opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.862" offset="12934771">I think that the colloquy that Justice Marshall had with Mr. McConnell points the direction, as I see it, to the solution in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.948" offset="12979179">Mr. McConnell said that as he walked down Washington somebody tried to hustle him into a bookstore and there was no such similar hustling that appeared in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.518" offset="13033409">There’s nothing in the record at all along those lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.911" offset="13046993">What we have suggested on our papers, and I think it is wise and I think it follows the opinions mostly of you, Mr. Justice White, as I understand them and, that is, that a statute can be good or bad depending upon the record that it’s made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.568" offset="13113657">That is my understanding of Baird that, in that case, it wasn’t the statute that Your Honor was focusing on so much as proof in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.977" offset="13159320">Since the state was claiming that there was a health hazard, then Your Honor quite properly said whether there is any record that this phone was relevant to the health hazard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.155" offset="13211982">Now, there are again only two things that the state talked about in this case or any obscenity cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.985" offset="13243329">Mr. McConnell talks about minors and he talks about an obtrusive kind of distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.263" offset="13268407">Now, minors simply cannot be the basis of the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.609" offset="13297768">It is true-- I suppose it’s true that if there are books that are on the market generally, that some of these books will ultimately find their way to minors in the same way that if you have automobiles on the road, I suppose that minors are from time to time going to drive those automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.166" offset="13400064">And, in the same way, if you have cigarettes being sold, that minors are going to smoke cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.592" offset="13433710">But, Butler told us it was reinforced in Roth and it has been restated every opportunity this Court has had an opportunity to talk about the subject, that you cannot limit what adults are going to read because we are saying that it’s inappropriate for minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.244" offset="13504345">So that, in this case, for Mr. McConnell to argue that to follow the argument that we have suggested would mean that there is a greater likelihood that minors will get books simply does not meet the constitutional issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3407.289" offset="13732551">Now, it’s true that that was a bookseller who was convicted, but the Court did talk about the right of a minor in that situation and he didn’t have-- the minor did not have the same right.</text>

            <text syncTime="3472.251" offset="13992417">That is correct, Your Honor, but this Court, on a number of occasions, has already taken the step in terms of saying that the right of a minor is not as great as the right of adult.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.033" offset="14059499">Your Honors did that, of course, in the Prince case in the beginning, came back again in Ginsberg, and. it came up in a fashion, I suppose, in the case-- the Yoder case, Wisconsin versus Yoder.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="3502.345" offset="14112789">Are you saying that states have a certain amount of latitude in determining this that California might say age 17 and New Hampshire might say age 20 just as they can on contract liability?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stanley_fleishman" startTime="3516.546" stopTime="3728.463">
            <label>Mr. Stanley Fleishman</label>
            <text syncTime="3516.546" offset="14169527">There is certainly some latitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.232" offset="14176319">I don’t think that I would accept 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.457" offset="14189171">Since a person could vote at 18, I think that whenever you go above 18 you’re going to get into a question of rationality but, certainly, the state does have the right to have a different test for minors and, I might add that, in California, we do have a minor’s statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.899" offset="14246954">In California, if in fact there was a sale to minors, there is a specific statute which would control that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.589" offset="14277778">Now, the other aspect of the case that Mr. McConnell rise-- raises is, one, is I say is minors and that certainly won’t do it and the other is that if you have a rule such as we’re arguing for that they may be, it may end up in, an obtrusive thrusting upon an unwilling audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.837" offset="14358758">The simple answer to that is, when that time comes, the State of California is absolutely free to charge a person, put on proof of that, and to convict him for thrusting it upon an unwilling audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.785" offset="14414555">We do not ask, in this case, that the statute be touched at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.545" offset="14429602">All we say is and all we argue for is that the state has simply gone too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.277" offset="14452485">It has infringed upon a constitutional right when it has punished Mr. Kaplan for doing no more than selling the book under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.567" offset="14497625">Now, there is one or two other things that I would like to touch on if I may in the brief time still remaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.426" offset="14525106">Mr. McConnell says, of course, Griswold and Baird stand on the high ground that the discussion about birth control is very important, very fundamental, and of course the state cannot interfere with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.233" offset="14588322">And then he says in a way that I don’t quite understand that sex somehow is not important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.668" offset="14610056">People somehow are not interested in sex, as I hear Mr. McConnell’s argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.000" offset="14631372">The simple fact is that people are enormously interested in the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.133" offset="14651956">If there’s one thing that we know, it is that the people buy books dealing with sex, very explicit books.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.320" offset="14684662">They look at films of this kind and they derive a great deal of value from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.438" offset="14709112">The Commission of Upsetting Pornography spent some-two years engaged in an enormous amount of original research.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.392" offset="14740982">It engaged in a great deal of scientific survey taking in terms of whom reads sexy books, why do they read them, what do they get out of them, and they have concluded that the people who read them, for the most part, are middle-aged, middle-class, White people who read them and derive a great deal of pleasure, information, and satisfactions from reading this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.565" offset="14849651">Now, it therefore seems to me to be inappropriate and wrong to make an argument that Griswold and Baird will correctly decided it because the discussion was about contraceptives and how to get-- whether or not one would have children but, at the same time, that a book or magazine which deals with sex, explicit sexual material is somehow without social value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.006" offset="14955395">It’s not the fact, and I believe that the commission studies and our whole history has taught us that there is, in fact, value in books such as Suite 69 even if the values do not seem to include all of us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.344" offset="15012760">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
