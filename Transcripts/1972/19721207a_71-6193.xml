            <text syncTime="20.066" offset="183672">This case, I think factually, if I may state it briefly, presents a simple question of fact in that, the crime charged in this case involved a situation where two men were arrested in Cincinnati, Ohio with some alleged stolen goods which was to be shipped in interstate commerce, and taken across the Ohio River into Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.109" offset="295790">The next day, in Manchester, Kentucky, a City Police Judge in Manchester issued a search warrant for state and local officers to go into a store which belonged to Mr. Knuckles and search for stolen property.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.472" offset="393279">The search warrant was signed in blank by the judge, the affidavit was signed in blank by the judge and the District Court held that the search warrant was not worth the paper that it was written on, and he quashed the search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.710" offset="478229">However, the officers, I think being unaware of that or whether they were aware or not, they went ahead and searched for two days in this man’s store and --</text>

            <text syncTime="171.265" offset="788459">After the goods were brought in Cincinnati, word was gotten down to Manchester, Kentucky and all the employees of the store of the merchandising company from which the goods were taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.024" offset="843421">He came back to Manchester the next day, as I understand it and he got the warrant from the City Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.077" offset="867662">Now, these men were indicted together with Clinton Knuckles who is also not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.827" offset="902666">And the first count charged on them was a conspiracy to move these goods in interstate commerce; charge on the second count was simply transporting goods in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.328" offset="956688">The third count involved the other defendant who is not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.396" offset="972988">Now, the case was appealed in the Sixth Circuit and the Sixth Circuit held, among other things that a harmless error had been committed because the rulings of this Court in Bruton had been violated, and they upheld the District Court’s ruling that these men did not have standing to suppress this evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.798" offset="1074552">Now, factually that’s the case that we're concerned with here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.146" offset="1103914">Now, if I may, I would like to address myself to the question of these men's standing to suppress this evidence first.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.627" offset="1137873">Now, the Court will, of course, is aware of the fact, they were indicted on a conspiracy charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.795" offset="1178520">Now, the goods that were seized in Kentucky to prove the conspiracy could be used to further conspiracy against these petitioners Smith and Brown, but it could not be used to prove the same conspiracy against the co-conspirator and defendant Clinton Knuckles.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.312" offset="1276635">You have here one conspiracy which is charged against three men and under the Law of Conspiracy certainly any statement racked down by any co-conspirator during the time of the conspiracy or during the life of the conspiracy is chargeable to all the conspirators.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.289" offset="1352495">Any deed, any act or any words spoken by a co-conspirator, it’s charged to the other men.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.319" offset="1384678">It’s his act too; it’s his statement too.</text>

            <text syncTime="325.197" offset="1404113">Well, if the Sixth Circuit sought that some of these errors were harmless because these men were caught with truck and possession of the large amount of stolen goods, nothing could have altered the result, is that not right?</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="346.525" stopTime="349.773">

            <label>Mr. Lowell W. Lundy</label>
            <text syncTime="349.773" offset="1502438">They had a pretty strong case against them, stealing out of a warehouse in Cincinnati.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.840" offset="1522709">If all the stuff was taken out of the store was not used against them, I think they could not have proven a federal case against them, nor could they have proven a conspiracy against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.733" offset="1574327">Now, I say that for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.662" offset="1586030">At the trial of the case, the court instructed the jury that they must have found these defendants guilty of having committed the third overt act charged in the indictment in order to get the case into Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.353" offset="1656769">One overt act according to trial had to have been committed in Kentucky, otherwise the Eastern District in Kentucky would have had no venue over the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.778" offset="1698461">It would have been improper venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.010" offset="1707447">Now, that overt act charged that these men delivered stolen merchandise, which they had stolen Cincinnati and taken into Manchester, Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.966" offset="1763244">Now, the Court instructed the jury to that effect that they must -- if they did find them guilty of committing that one overt act, then there wouldn't have been any business of being in United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.817" offset="1818624">Now, without all these merchandise that was gotten -- stolen in Manchester, Kentucky, they couldn’t have proven that and they wouldn’t have had the venue and they wouldn’t have proven any interstate transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.507" offset="1861360">They may have gotten for stealing in the State of Ohio, but they wouldn't have had any interstate violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.946" offset="1887169">So, from that point of view, I don’t think it was a harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.803" offset="1906604">I think that if, if they -- I look at a harmless error in this manner, if you take the evidence, if you suppress the evidence and take it out of it, we wouldn’t have a chance to beat the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="464.471" offset="1961253">We wouldn’t have a chance to win the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="467.534" offset="1973478">Now, if you are living in there would you have any chance to win or wouldn't you?</text>
            <text syncTime="470.585" offset="1985703">You're living in there, and certainly you wouldn't have, but if you take it out, then they don't have much of a case.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="477.977" offset="2015274">Does the exclusionary rule apply when if the government attempted to prove venue as opposed to proving the elements of the offense itself?</text>

            <text syncTime="489.785" offset="2062503">I wouldn't think it would make any difference really.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.082" offset="2087685">If it’s suppressed, its evidence is excluded, it is excluded out, say probably for all the purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.505" offset="2121435">If you couldn't admit the evidence within the trial except which the government would have to do, then they wouldn’t have proven the venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.062" offset="2155604">So, I don’t think you would really -- if you suppress it, you suppress it for all purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.715" offset="2182248">Now, I am sure this Court is aware that you had -- this Court has rendered decisions in cases which touch up well on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.093" offset="2255705">Certainly in the case of Jones versus United States and Simmons versus United States, Alderman versus United States in which a rule has been established that, that man didn't have to come in plain possession or something, rather to have the standing to suppress it.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.213" offset="2340237">These either were lots on the premises or there was some possessory interest in it, while he has standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.992" offset="2367300">Now, I think that in the case which was almost precisely important to the facts of this case, is the decision that was rendered, in July 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.059" offset="2431561">It came out of the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.881" offset="2438875">It's United States versus Price.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.975" offset="2455280">The facts of the case -- the facts in that case were very similar to the ones in this case and there was a situation where some fellow stole a bunch of TV sets and he took them and hid them in a warehouses at some place.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.443" offset="2521109">The warehouse was not in the possession or nor was the defendant present when the search was made in the warehouse and the Second Circuit came to the conclusion that the man had standing to suppress the evidence and they ordered in their opinion they remanded the case for a hearing on that point, knowing that he may establish it.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.127" offset="2635839">Now the Sixth Circuit of course in this very case here, and as even in the Price case it involved the conspiracy also.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.451" offset="2669171">Now the Sixth Circuit of course has taken the contrary position.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.513" offset="2685471">They say that my men had no standing to suppress this evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.559" offset="2705638">Carlos worked there and it wasn't a possessory crime and they had no standing to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.780" offset="2746493">Now certainly the law was not complied within this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.077" offset="2807724">The Judge of the Police Court in Manchester, Kentucky just signed his name to a piece of paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.501" offset="2833324">He told the County Attorney and we can assume that maybe the City Judge of a small town didn't know any better, being a lame, he told the County Attorney, he said you go and just fill it in, I have got to take my wife to the hospital and I think the man signed another piece of paper for the affidavit, told the county attorney to go and fill it in.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.666" offset="2918066">County attorney he filled in the affidavit for the search warrant and he talked to the effect and the purposed effect and that – they did not have enough detail in it and so they tore that up, did another one and then they give this to officers and the officer went down there and searched.</text>

            <text syncTime="869.611" offset="3581785">But it is very difficult for me to see how if you are going to prove one conspiracy you can use different quantities or qualities of evidence to prove it against different people.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.439" offset="3653151">If we three gentleman sitting conspired to commit a crime, it bothers me to think that they can use more use evidence against me then the can against these two fellows.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.491" offset="3693380">You all will be able to take same evidence to convict all three of us and you ought to let same the quality of evidence being used as far as all of us are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.884" offset="3746879">Now, this crime that they have these fellows charged with here is not, I would say a possessory crime per se, like you had in the case where the man had the narcotics in the Bird case, Bird and Jones case, but the United States could not prove this case unless it showed that sometime these men had all of this two truck loads of stuffs in its possession.</text>

            <text syncTime="1420.240" offset="5784325">Mr Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.200" offset="5796133">This case presents principally two questions relating to the application of the automatic standing rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.049" offset="5819538">First whether it applies where the possession charged is of stolen property, second whether it applies where the possession charged is possession that was at a time other than the time when the search and seizure took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.779" offset="5874500">I would argue the answer to both of these questions is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.428" offset="5889128">The case is similar in some respects to the Clums case which was here last term and which the Court disposed off without deciding the automatic standing issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.785" offset="5922461">On the day that Clums was decided, a certiorari was granted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.704" offset="5946180">Mr Lundy has detailed the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.078" offset="5959659">In essence petitioners Brown and Smith were engaged in stealing merchandise from the Central Jobbing Company in Cincinnati.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.860" offset="5998843">They transported the merchandise across state lines to Kentucky where they sold it to Clinton Knuckles, the owner of the Knuckles Dollar Store.</text>

            <text syncTime="1494.939" offset="6083166">The petitioners were charged with interstate transportation of stolen merchandise and with conspiracy to commit the substantive offense and on a motion to suppress they sought to exclude the evidence that was seized from the Knuckles store.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.930" offset="6135097">The courts below rejected these contentions on the ground that the petitioners lacked standing to make them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.364" offset="6168848">In our view, it is clear on these facts that the petitioners have no standing under the traditional standing rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.678" offset="6198105">That rule requires a showing of an interest either in the premises that were searched or in the property that was seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.041" offset="6227571">The petitioners here have no interest in the premises that was searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.765" offset="6242408">It was Knuckles stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.401" offset="6248991">They have never asserted that they had any interest in the premises and they were not present at the time when the search was conducted, in fact they were in custody in Ohio having been arrested the previous day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.496" offset="6293400">Nor did they have they have an interest in the property that was seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.043" offset="6303535">There is no proprietary interest because the property was stolen, it didn't belong to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.318" offset="6320671">There is no possessory interest because they parted with the possession two months earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.291" offset="6344495">In other words, their Fourth Amendment rights were not implicated by this search and seizure, to the extent that Mr. Lundy has on argument here attacked the traditional standing rule, I believe that as recently as Alderman it's been upheld indefinitively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.330" offset="6416697">The Fourth Amendment rights are not assertable vicariously and their personal rights and the exclusionary rule is limited to circumstances where one can allege that he has been a victim of an unlawful search rather than one who is aggrieved solely by introduction of evidence that was so seized.</text>

            <text syncTime="1972.115" offset="7991881">Because the petitioners here lacked the traditional stand -- the standing under the traditional rule they sought to invoke the automatic rule that was established by the Jones case and Jones, the automatic standing rule is a narrow exception to the traditional rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.979" offset="8059277">In Jones, narcotics were seized during a search and seizure of an apartment belonging to a friend of the defendant while the defendant was on the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.405" offset="8100968">He was charged with various narcotics offenses which because of statutory presumptions permitted conviction on showing of mere knowing possessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.326" offset="8144645">On these facts the court held first that the defendant’s lawful presence of the premises gave him a sufficient interest in the premises to justify his standing to challenge the reasonableness of the search of those premises and to move to suppress the fruits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.069" offset="8215698">Now this aspect of the Jones case is not involved here because as everybody has agreed, the petitioners have never asserted an interest in the Knuckle store.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.840" offset="8250702">The Court in Jones could have stopped there, but it went on and it considered whether independent of Jones' interest in the premises searched whether he had sufficient interest in the property that was seized to justify standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.725" offset="8310262">Now it was of course the fact that Jones possessed the narcotics, that he was accused of possessing and he possessed them at the time the seizure was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.101" offset="8351744">And it was apparent in the Court's view that had Jones been prepared to come forward and testify as to his possession at the time of the seizure he would have had standing under the traditional rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.199" offset="8404198">The problem was he was not in a position to come forward, he was not willing to come forward to testify and the reason he was not willing to come forward to testify is because at that time there was a substantial risk that his testimony as to his possession at the time of the suppression hearing could be used against in the trial and as part of the Government’s case in chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.928" offset="8491133">Because of this dilemma that the defendant was faced with, the Court ruled that he need not make the showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.019" offset="8519450">Where the government, in its indictment has already conceded in effect that he could make the showing, there was a corollary rationale that was articulated by the Court as well and that is that contrary holding, that is that Jones must come forward or in practical effect would be unable to come forward, would give the government the benefit of inconsistent positions because it would be arguing in a sense at the trial that the defendant possessed the narcotics at the time they were seized; that was the basis of the charge, while the suppression hearing by challenging his standing, they would implicitly be saying that he had no possession at the time of the seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.092" offset="8687783">This the Court viewed as not consonant with the amenities of the administration of criminal justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.630" offset="8717876">The first thing to be said about Jones in respect to the case here is that unlike Jones, the petitioners here have no standing under the traditional standing rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.278" offset="8760508">As we have discussed they have no interest in the Knuckle store and in our view, they have no interest in the property seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.217" offset="8788198">In our view, the automatic standing rule of Jones was designed solely for those, who would otherwise have had standing under the traditional rule, but were unable to assert that standing because of the situation that prevailed at that time, with respect to the use of testimony, suppression testimony at a subsequent trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2463.456" offset="9957230">Well, I think not because as I have indicated -- they gave up a possessory interest in the property some two months before the search was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.924" offset="10003101">So even if they were to come forward and make an assertion that they couldn't make, mainly that they did possess it at the time the search was made; I think that the applicable rule in those circumstances would be the Simmons rule, which resolves the dilemma in a non-Jones context, namely the testimony they gave would have not been able to be used against them, that seems to me to be the sensible resolution of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.351" offset="10156805">To summarize the discussion with respect to the dilemma aspect of Jones as applied here, we think it just does not require since there is no dilemma that remains at this point, there is no need to apply the automatic standing rule on our facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.739" offset="10226291">Nor do we think that the alternative rationale of Jones requires an application of its rule in these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.286" offset="10260564">Because in the circumstances we have here, there is no inconsistency of position that the government is forced to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.358" offset="10288776">The government must show as part of its case in this, in detail that Brown and Smith possessed the Central Jobbing Company merchandise at some point, but that possession was two months prior to the time the search was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.934" offset="10355127">The government need not deny at the suppression hearing that the petitioners were at one time in possession of the merchandise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.421" offset="10385011">It's a wholly consistent position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.168" offset="10400057">It's argument really is that at the time of the search, there was no possessory interest justifying Fourth Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.384" offset="10444884">Well alternatively, even if there was such a Fourth Amendment interest that deserved protection or even if there was a coincident or contemporaneous possession, the possession was of stolen property and possession of stolen property merits no Fourth Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.338" offset="10508727">In our view therefore, there is no reason to apply on these facts a rule that was designed to benefit only those who would have had standing under the traditional rule, but for our constitutional dilemma that has been resolved in a different way by Simmons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.335" offset="10564733">The petitioners here seek not a resolution of a dilemma that they face, but really a reaping of an unintended and unnecessary windfall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.085" offset="10603708">There is another issue in this case involving a Bruton violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.662" offset="10621994">There was testimony at the trial concerning statements made by both Brown and Smith, which were in some respects cross inculpatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.521" offset="10661491">We conceive this was error but as we detail in our brief, we believe the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and unless there are questions, I would not propose to deal with it further at this time.</text>
