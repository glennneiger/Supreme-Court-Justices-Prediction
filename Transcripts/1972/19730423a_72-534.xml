            <label>Mr. A. Raymond Randolph, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="81.867" offset="430791">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.236" offset="440299">This is an appeal from the judgment of the three judge Federal District Court in District of Columbia, holding Section 3 of the Food Stamp Act unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment insofar as it limits eligibility for food stamps to related households.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.916" offset="499022">The court enjoined the Secretary of Agriculture from denying eligibility to households containing one or more unrelated individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.327" offset="528697">The issue in this case is whether Section 3 of the Food Stamp Act is so unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.203" offset="556178">I will first give a brief description of the Food Stamp Act, then deal with the particular facts of this case and then discuss our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.157" offset="583973">The Food Stamp Program was enacted in 1964 to raise the nutritional level of low income households and to strengthen the agricultural economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.238" offset="624306">Eligibility to participate in the program is on a household basis, rather than on an individual, although an individual can comprise a household if living alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.646" offset="661922">An eligible household exchanges an amount of money for what is termed an allotment of food stamps or coupons of a higher monetary value.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.671" offset="698075">The difference between what the household actually pays for the coupons and their actual value is the federal contributions to the household's increased purchasing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.265" offset="740394">The household uses these coupons to purchase food at the prevailing price in participating retails stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.126" offset="767875">The retailer redeems the coupons through the commercial banking system.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.699" offset="786160">The amount of allotment to a household is determined by the household size.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.321" offset="804655">For example, at present, a household of four persons is alloted a $112 a month; a household of five, a $132 and so forth and new allotment levels coming to effect each year and I am told that 38 federal register, 8287; the new allotment levels effective July 1, 1973 are printed.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.017" offset="903398">The amount of money a household must exchange for it is coupon allotment depends on the household's monthly net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.131" offset="931924">For example, a household of four, with $250 monthly net income must pay $71 for this, $112 allotment of coupons.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.966" offset="975287">If the net income to the household is $330, the household pays $86 for a $112 coupons and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.624" offset="1009873">The Food Stamp Program is not a mandatory program, it is a joint federal, state and local government undertaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.041" offset="1035577">Counties and independent cities as well as states have the option whether or not to participate in the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.305" offset="1060551">At present, all but about one-third of the counties and cities in the country have Food Stamp Programs, that is 2,204 out of 3,129 have Food Stamp Programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.672" offset="1110079">Three states, Nevada, Delaware and New Hampshire have no Food Stamp Program whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.074" offset="1135679">While the Federal government pays for the increased food purchasing power of the household and sets uniform national standards of eligibility, the day-to-day administration of the program is handled largely by state agencies to certify households as eligible, investigate applications, issue the stamps and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.472" offset="1205269">A substantial percentage of the administrative costs are paid for by the state out of it is own pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.204" offset="1232227">Section 3 of the Act, the statue at issue in this case, defines the term household for eligibility purposes as “A group of related individuals or non-related individuals over age 60, who are living as one economic unit, sharing common cooking facilities and for whom home food is customarily purchased in common.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.690" offset="1318118">Appellees who live with unrelated persons claim that because Section 3(e) limits eligibility to groups of related individuals, a provision that resorted from 1971 amendments to the Act, Congress has deprived them of food stamps in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.582" offset="1385723">It brought this class action seeking a declaration that Section 3(e) is unconstitutional and an injunction -- and seeking also an injunction against its operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.870" offset="1422817">A three-judge court was convened.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.556" offset="1433579">Each of the five individual appellees or groups of appellees representing a class alleges that they were denied food stamps because they did not live in related households.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.345" offset="1476733">Appellee, Mrs. Moreno resides in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.688" offset="1490108">She lives with another woman, who has three children.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.537" offset="1501497">Both Mrs. Moreno and her co-tenant, Mrs. Sanchez are on public assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.658" offset="1521977">However, it appears from Mrs. Moreno's affidavit on the appendix, which is the brown volume, on Page 24, that Mrs. Sanchez is receiving food stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.776" offset="1570461">Appellee, Mrs. Keppler lives in Oakland, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.495" offset="1585403">She and her two children, joined with another woman to rent a house for $275 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.584" offset="1609749">Both Mrs. Kepler and her co-tenant are on public assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.443" offset="1625109">The record does not reveal their combined income.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.799" offset="1638588">Appellee Mrs. Hejny lives in North Carolina with her husband, their are three children and a young woman who is unrelated to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.118" offset="1667845">Mrs. Hejny husband is a pipe layer.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.393" offset="1676936">Weather sometimes prevents him from working during one month, February, which his income is reported for, he made $90, he brought home $90 a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.073" offset="1715702">The young women living with them, who is now 21 years old, earned about $20 a month babysitting.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.856" offset="1742764">The Hejnys have very high and very substantial medical expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.670" offset="1758020">Appellee David Durant resides in Salt Lake City, Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.499" offset="1773380">He is a student at the University of Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.879" offset="1782888">He lives with another young man.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.741" offset="1790307">He and his co-tenant earned $170 doing odd jobs in January, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.078" offset="1815698">The remaining appellees are a group of five unrelated individuals, three men and two women, who lived together in Columbia, South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.171" offset="1848090">One is a full-time student and the others are unemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.619" offset="1861883">They joined together, their affidavit states, for economic reasons and out of personal affinity for one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.370" offset="1884871">They pool all resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.871" offset="1894902">On cross motions for summary judgment, to District Court held at Section 3(e), by extending food stamp eligibility only to related households, discriminates against persons and groups containing unrelated individuals such as the appellees in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.352" offset="1964805">Court said that it was unable to perceive any rational basis for Congress' making only related households eligible and thus, not including unrelated households as well in eligibility for food stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.076" offset="2015692">In discussing this question, first of all, I would like to deal with what class exactly is it that is affected by this.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.609" offset="2045785">As we said the Bar Section 3 is definition of household as a related group for individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.878" offset="2070862">On Page 12, the appellees define the class as, Page 12 of their briefs, the white copy, as composed of persons in need of food stamps as are related household members, but who live in households that include one or more persons who are unrelated to everyone else in that household.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.827" offset="2138676">This is not an accurate description of the class that is ineligible for food stamps under Section 3(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="515.285" offset="2164485">First of all, for purposes of Section 3(e), the statute specifically provides that if unrelated persons, 60 years old or older are living in the household, in otherwise, eligible household does not disqualify.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.726" offset="2222268">Second, if there are children, by regulation second, if there are children under the age of 18, but not related to any of the adult members of the household or not even legally adopted or assigned through a Foster Home, the household does not render ineligible so long as one of the parents performs the duty or one of the adults performs the duties of a parent with respect to such children.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.739" offset="2310353">Third, even if a man and woman, this is again by regulations, are living together and not married or related, they can still comprise an eligible household so long as they are treated by the community as husband and wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.015" offset="2359463">This regulation is sort of a federal common law of marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.714" offset="2378271">Fourth and perhaps most significant, even if none of these examples apply, unrelated persons living together are not automatically ineligible for food stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.702" offset="2418186">As we noted in Pages 9 through 11 of our reply brief, the recent decision in the District Court in California Knowles versus Butz, which the department of agriculture, it's at Page 9 through 11, we discussed this case and is reprinted in the appendix to our reply brief, holds, the Knowles decision holds that even if people live in the same house or apartment and share housing expenses, they are not necessarily one household for purposes of eligibility because in under the Act in order to be considered a household, the group of persons must operate as an economic unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.200" offset="2576175">That is common living expenses must be shared in the income of all, the needs of all members have to be provided without regard to a willingness -- willingness or ability to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.325" offset="2620688">For example if two unrelated founders move in together and share only housing expenses, they could be considered two related households instead of one unrelated household.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.376" offset="2668857">Perhaps Mrs Keppler might serve as an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.664" offset="2685994">Her situation is reported on pages 26 to 27 of the Appendix and she alleges that she moved in with another woman in order to save housing expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.372" offset="2728835">There is no indication that there’s a general pooling or sharing of all resources without regard to willingness to contribute or pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.409" offset="2761017">In our brief we through the analogy that just simply because two Lawyers for example share an office, it doesn't mean that they are necessarily partners even if they both share the expenses for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.668" offset="2802082">I think there are numerous other examples of this.</text>

            <text syncTime="829.312" offset="3420662">That's right, I have wanted to give an accurate definition of what class people of were affected by this and it's not accurate to say that simply because two unrelated people are living together they are disqualified from receiving food stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.833" offset="3470712">That is not an accurate description of class, that is not necessarily so unless they are living as an economic unit pooling all resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.840" offset="3502686">Prior to 1971 both related and unrelated households were eligible for food stamp relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.832" offset="3530689">During 1969, 1970, however, before the program's organization for preparation inspired and the food stamp gets an authorization every year on a present practice since reevaluated, Congress too undertook a comprehensive reevaluation of the program's operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.707" offset="3602160">As representative Foley stated on the house floor, there was congressional concern about participation in the program by what he termed “Collections of essentially unrelated individuals who voluntarily choose to cohabit and live of food stamps.”</text>
            <text syncTime="890.401" offset="3664959">The Congress had evidence during the hearings that at lease in one food stamp jurisdiction 38.6% of the non assistance households were either groups of college students living as fraternities and 42.4% of the non assistance households were groups of unrelated individuals who joined together to adopt the communal life style.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.290" offset="3752521">The revision of Section 3(e) by the Conference Committee dealt with this problem by extending food stamp relief only to related households.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.842" offset="3786689">And we believe this is an example of what the quote spoke about in Williamson and Lee Optical and Dandridge and Williams and Jefferson and Hackney of Congress permissively selecting one face of the problem, in this case related households, and applying a remedy there.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.068" offset="3847607">We submit Congress had rational basis for doing this and therefore did not violate the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.017" offset="3871431">And allocating assistance among potential recipients, Congress could irrationally, and indeed probably must, follow some scale of priorities in determining need.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.648" offset="3913958">In following the scale of priorities we think it was quite irrational for Congress to say that communal groups such as the kind described by Congressman Foley would rank very low in the scale of priorities as opposed to people that were in need out of circumstances that were not of their control.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.993" offset="3979368">And Congress could therefore, we believe, decide not extend relief beyond related households because to do so would encompass the kinds of groups the Congressman Foley spoke about on house floor, that is communal groups and also college fraternities that were living of food stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.192" offset="4048123">This kind of allocation I think is illustrated by Dandridge and Williams where the Court said that the constitution does empower this Court to second guest officials charged with a difficult responsibility of allocating limited public welfare funds among the myriad of potential recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.186" offset="4116146">We think there was an additional reason why Congress could conclude that it was proper only aid related households.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.447" offset="4145194">Congress knew the relative instability of groups of unrelated individuals as compared with related household as this could cause administrative difficulties because household eligibilities since the allotment for month, it must be determined on a continuing basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.853" offset="4206738">The certification of the household depends on how stable the household is, if it's a very unstable household with different income coming in with different people living in it, there must be a constant certification of determine it's allotment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.224" offset="4284270">This increased administrative expenses, something that we think additionally served as rational basis for Congress' classification as it did.</text>

            <text syncTime="1110.358" offset="4544763">I think Congress knew this as well as the director of the California services and New York -- and they also knew that by having related households in the program they can increase the administrative cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.856" offset="4586768">Now for rational basis means, a basis derived from reasoning, we think this statute meets that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.475" offset="4613308">As I said before there are groups within the unrelated households group that Congress reasonably I think and certainly rationally could conclude were not deserving a food stamp on any kind of scale of priorities that Congress could follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.650" offset="4665971">And second of all by including unrelated households Congress could also conclude that it would create increased administrative expense was may in fact deter states or counties from adopting the program at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.799" offset="4718529">It's no answer to say of this as appellees do, well, there are other ways of taking care of these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.086" offset="4739741">For example, we have criminal sanctions and in 1971, Congress added a requirement that people must register and for accept employment as a condition to food stamp relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.693" offset="4786134">The very harshness of the criminal penalties for abuses suggest this use and there was testimony on the house floor that it was not an effective remedy and the work requirement which requires adult numbers of the household, the register for and accept employment had just been added to the Act simultaneously with the revision of Section 3(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.124" offset="4867845">This was thus new and untried and Congress was well aware of the administrative difficulties it had in controlling this nationwide program under the existing practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.056" offset="4903581">It surely was not required to assume that the constitution forbid it from extending relief only to related households because it just added a work provision to the Act which was yet untried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.849" offset="4946735">This is not to say that there might have been other ways for Congress to respond to these problems, but that Section 3(e) is the best approach or even a wise one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.777" offset="4982471">But as the Court is continually reminded the wisdom or I might add, the unwisdom of a particular statutory is not a proper subject subject for judicial inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.511" offset="5017370">We believe Congress had rational base for extending relief only to related households and the Fifth Amendment requires no more.</text>

            <text syncTime="1320.417" offset="5385070">I think there are two useful tools for analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.679" offset="5398131">The first tool is the traditional tool, the traditional standard, is the provision rationally related to the purposes of the Food Stamp Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.577" offset="5433657">Is it reasonably related to some legitimate Governmental purpose?</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.778" offset="5450480">The second tool that I think is applicable in this case is a compelling Governmental interest has because of provision here at issue impinges directly upon appellee's associational and privacy interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.411" offset="5501053">I would like to concentrate on the first test, however, the traditional standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="1379.525" offset="5621426">At the very most Your Honor I think in that case it only had incidental effect with relation to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.346" offset="5644727">Here there’s a very direct relationship with the associational and the privacy right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.471" offset="5669282">Here only if you associate in the confines of your home are you denied food stamps, only for that reason and it's a very direct intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.751" offset="5706376">There at most it was indirect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.777" offset="5718497">I think though under any standard whether we use a compelling governmental interest standard or whether we use a traditional standard, you cannot find a legitimate governmental interest that is reasonably related to by this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.432" offset="5777115">Now what is the real purpose between -- for the unrelated household provision was very clear, is to eliminate hippies, to eliminate hippie communes from the Food Stamp Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.737" offset="5822360">How do we glean this purpose?</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.877" offset="5830928">Well we glean this purpose from the congressional history, the legislative history of this provision and although that legislative history is very sparse because it was not the debated it was formulated for the first time by conference community and it was hurriedly passed by the house and the senate thereafter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1631.692" offset="6630170">The reason is if you look at decision in Knowles v. Butz, for determining what is going to be the group of people, to find out whether they are household three factors must be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.567" offset="6673638">First factor is that they must live as one economic unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.048" offset="6691610">Secondly they must purchase food in common and third they must share common cooking facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.529" offset="6717524">The appellants argue in essence in this case that this provision does not have harsh effect because all people have to do in order to eliminate themselves from the harshness of this provision is to separate themselves and live as separate economic units.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.298" offset="6788577">As an example, if a household was denied at food stamps because there unrelated people in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.114" offset="6815848">All they have to do is divide themselves or fractionate themselves and therefore they can then be eligible as separate households.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.181" offset="6848136">What I would suggest Your Honor is that this provision does more to make it difficult to administrator the program because what it encourages is, is it encourages the voluntary poor people to fractionate their households, ,making it much more difficult to keep track of the money, making it much more difficult to administrator the program.</text>
