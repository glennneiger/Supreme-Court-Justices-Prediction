            <label>Mr. Stanley M. Dietz</label>
            <text syncTime="32.710" offset="234245">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.418" offset="257024">This is a third act in your trilogy of obscenity cases, but I am not going to follow the line urged by Mr. Fleishman and Mr. Brown-- excuse me, by Mr. Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.024" offset="343437">And that is because, as I view the exhibits involved in my case and as all of the testimony that was produced by the Commonwealth and by the defense that our material did not involved hardcore pornography, which brings me to think about the Roth case because the Roth case involved hardcore pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.035" offset="475512">The case -- certiorari was granted on the limited point of whether hardcore pornography was protected by the First Amendment, and you ruled that it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.687" offset="534131">In the Roth case, as I understand it, the Post Office Department submitted exhibits, examples of what hardcore pornography really was.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="128.711" offset="618245">Well, Mr. Dietz, my recollection of Roth was that the concession was that the materials involved were obscene, whether hardcore or what, it wasn’t suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.708" offset="678222">We didn’t even have the exhibits here, and the concession I think is, as it appears in the footnote in Roth, simply that the materials there involved were obscene and that concession was made to present the question whether obscenity was protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.863" offset="754813">And, you keep talking about hardcore pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.005" offset="763382">I thought that was, I think, a phrase that came in much later.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stanley M. Dietz</label>
            <text syncTime="169.523" offset="781458">Well, because Your Honor wrote the opinion for the Court, I was not involved in that case so I --</text>

            <text syncTime="177.475" offset="813223">Well, you don’t find the words “hardcore pornography” anywhere in the opinion, do you?</text>

            <label>Mr. Stanley M. Dietz</label>
            <text syncTime="181.350" offset="828792">No, sir, but I understood that there were exhibits submitted of hardcore pornography.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="188.634" offset="857945">I know nothing about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.758" offset="862438">We had no exhibits here in that case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stanley M. Dietz</label>
            <text syncTime="193.166" offset="876022">I stand and correct it.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.474" offset="893262">Actually, I felt that in this pornography field it had really boiled down over the years to interpreting the Roth case to mean hardcore pornography.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="214.707" stopTime="216.242">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="214.707" offset="962226">Well, I think that’s a different argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stanley_m_dietz" startTime="216.242" stopTime="365.474">
            <label>Mr. Stanley M. Dietz</label>
            <text syncTime="216.242" offset="968391">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.430" offset="981138">Of course, in the very recent case, Reidel, you -- the Court, again, stated that hardcore pornography or that obscenity was not constitutionally protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.428" offset="1045086">Well, my argument is that the materials in this case, if you compare them with other materials with this -- which this Court has had under consideration in such matters as Weiner and Dolan (ph) versus California, which depict only simulated sexual activities, simulated sexual activities which I would define as possibly inches or possibly seconds away from the actual consummation, but leaving to the imagination the actual graphic depiction, the actual passage of the scene, and I would urge this Court to draw the line at that line at that place, differentiating between simulated sexual activities which should be constitutionally protected if you have the other elements involved for adults only and without any obtrusive advertising, which is the school of law which has mushroomed since the decision of this Court in Redrup versus New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.831" offset="1394709">Now, in this case that I have today, we have a statute in the State of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.441" offset="1429086">It’s a civil statute, although it’s part of the Criminal Code, and it provides for any person, state’s attorney or commonwealth attorney, any person, any citizen to bring an action to declare a book obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.451" offset="1497213">It specifically prohibits a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.959" offset="1523231">I, therefore, say it is unconstitutional, because in an obscenity case I feel a jury trial is mandated by the First Amendment.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="365.474" offset="1565236">What’s the First Amendment got to do with jury trials, at least on its face?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stanley_m_dietz" startTime="369.531" stopTime="396.082">
            <label>Mr. Stanley M. Dietz</label>
            <text syncTime="369.531" offset="1581537">Well, I recognize that the First Amendment does not spell out the jury trial, but if you take the Roth case definition of what is obscenity and what is not constitutionally protected under the First Amendment, then it must be decided by community standards and the community is the jury.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="396.082" stopTime="405.448">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="396.082" offset="1687698">You want not only a jury but a jury of the kind they’ve got 500 years ago where the jury brings its own knowledge to decide whether to hear the evidence.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stanley M. Dietz</label>
            <text syncTime="405.448" offset="1725210">No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.468" offset="1733256">I would follow the guidance of late Justice Frankfurter in Smith versus California when he said that it’s a jury question that you have to introduce expert testimony of these points of prurient interest and community standards to guide the jury in their deliberations.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="432.492" stopTime="434.281">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="432.492" offset="1833357">But that was a criminal case, wasn’t it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stanley_m_dietz" startTime="434.281" stopTime="700.571">
            <label>Mr. Stanley M. Dietz</label>
            <text syncTime="434.281" offset="1840462">Smith versus California was a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.473" offset="1849240">I recognize the distinction, and Roth was a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.842" offset="1862719">At the same time, this Court decided Kingsley Books case, Kingsley Books versus New York, Regents of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.282" offset="1908485">That case was a civil case and it did not raise this issue of a jury trial because, in that case, a jury was not requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.833" offset="1962715">I believe that Mr. Justice Frankfurter wrote the opinion for the Court and noted that advisory jury was available in New York but none was requested, but in my case, I have, right from the outset, requested a jury trial but this state statute specifically prohibits jury determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.809" offset="2054562">And, through my experience in defending, representing this particular company, we have many, many instances where a jury looks at obscenity exhibits differently than a judge alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.771" offset="2130422">You have pending in this Court a petition for certiorari, another case that I had, of Village Books versus Marshall where a judge viewed a book and said that was obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.586" offset="2177755">He issued an injunction against it in the State of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.436" offset="2189145">That same book tried before a jury, three different jurors, three different jurisdictions, acquitted because that was he criminal cases and I recognize there’s a different standard of proof involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.765" offset="2250480">But, I feel very strongly that First Amendment case, obscenity case, a jury trial should be allowed where prayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.570" offset="2289664">The second point that I claim this statute is unconstitutional is that it specifically provides for the community standard to be a city or a county.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.241" offset="2348387">It doesn’t even limit the community standard the way that, in the case that Mr. Fleishman argued to the State of California, it’s not the State of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.634" offset="2389870">It’s evidence of community standards in that city, in that county.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.753" offset="2410350">This is -- of course it’s very easy for the state to say “well, how else can we get experts?”</text>
            <text syncTime="584.124" offset="2439920">There are no things as an expert on national community standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.795" offset="2458520">So, what are we faced with?</text>
            <text syncTime="590.476" offset="2465311">We are faced with a so-called expert who, as we have in the record of this case, who had been part of a group that studied obscenity a year-and-a half before in that area and who had spoken with different people in various civic groups which consisted of the Navy Wives Club and who hadn’t been in an adult bookstore in a year or more, which I use the phrase “adult bookstore” to be referred to in the California case as “dirty bookstores.”</text>
            <text syncTime="629.832" offset="2622673">Well, I take issue with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.824" offset="2634689">Adult bookstores are stores that only trade with adults, who do not allow juvenile’s entrance and it’s so-stipulated in our case that we do not do business with juveniles.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.982" offset="2695293">All the states or nearly all the states have statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.859" offset="2710758">The District of Columbia does, the State of Maryland does, where they differentiate a different penalties involved if you deal with juveniles in the obscenity field, but that was not an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.212" offset="2760182">They stipulate in our case no juveniles involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.802" offset="2778572">So, it brings us back to the Community of Portsmouth and, I might say, this is not a situation where you have in Los Angeles some 250 adult bookstores.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.678" offset="2838131">This bookstore was the one and only bookstore in the City of Portsmouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.869" offset="2866866">I don’t know the exact population.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.517" offset="2877419">I think it’s about 70,000-75,000 people, but this is the only bookstore -- adult bookstore in that city.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="700.571" stopTime="705.540">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="700.571" offset="2905631">Do you think it makes a difference under the First Amendment whether they have 1 or 250?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stanley_m_dietz" startTime="705.540" stopTime="1125.037">
            <label>Mr. Stanley M. Dietz</label>
            <text syncTime="705.540" offset="2925484">No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.021" offset="2927470">I mention not, because I was discussing community standards and, earlier, I heard in argument -- statement that, are we to apply the community from some small city in Montana as a standard as compared with the entire State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.196" offset="3012106">California is covered with adult bookstores.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.919" offset="3027048">There are not quite so many in the Tidewater area.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.008" offset="3043453">There are approximately 10 that I am aware of, but only 1 in the City of Portsmouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.393" offset="3076995">Now, our community standards is -- might be argued that the majority of the people in the community don’t go into these bookstores and don’t make purchases from these bookstores.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.334" offset="3128717">Well, I would then argue to this Court that this is quite true.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.843" offset="3146794">The majority of the people are not costumers in my client’s bookstore, but the First Amendment was not made or created to protect only the majority view but I think, principally, the minority view point.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.986" offset="3211368">That’s the one where you have under the First Amendment the right to get up and say “well, I don’t agree with all you people.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.155" offset="3243969">This is my point of view.”</text>
            <text syncTime="787.803" offset="3254627">And that’s what’s being done in this bookstore in the City of Portsmouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.143" offset="3279914">Now, if I might, at this point, refer to another element of the issue of obscenity, they claim that and the judge, in his opinion, found these books to be patently offensive, patently offensive to whom?</text>
            <text syncTime="814.207" offset="3360162">Certainly not to the customers who go into that bookstore.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.240" offset="3384299">They are not forced in.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.198" offset="3392136">We don’t have sidewalks that pop them into the store as they walk by.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.952" offset="3411153">An adult bookstore, and particularly the adult bookstore in Portsmouth has the windows blocked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.489" offset="3437380">You cannot see inside and there are big signs, “Adult Bookstore, no minors allowed”.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.790" offset="3462562">And, if anyone comes into the store who might be close to the age of majority, he must demonstrate his credentials to prove that he is, in fact, adult.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.687" offset="3526092">Now, the second point that I wanted to claim as far as the statute being unconstitutional is that it affects a prior restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.498" offset="3573321">I won’t spend too much time on this point because they never, in fact, got the restraint off the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.175" offset="3612087">They, in this case, they went into the bookstore, took a list of all of the books that had anything to do with sex, issued a subpoena duces tecum to the management of the store to appear in Court with a copy of the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.677" offset="3706128">The people appeared and the books were taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.383" offset="3724936">Following which, the-- two of the judges reviewed the books and issued a show cause order and the Commonwealth attorney filed a petition asking that all of these books be declared obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.864" offset="3786794">Now, at that time, they also filed a notice to the two employees of the bookstore.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.218" offset="3824201">I think three or four days later, they were going to ask the Court for a temporary restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.722" offset="3854294">This is where we claim there would have been a prior restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.570" offset="3869654">It would have been granted had not we gone into Federal Court to ask for an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.441" offset="3893164">Then, the motion for restraining order was continued indefinitely and we never actually did have a hearing on the motion for restraining order, but this restraining order would have been in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.462" offset="3957217">There is absolutely no time limit as this Court has held constitutionally mandated in obscenity statutes of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.742" offset="4006327">There is no time limit other than the general boundary that it should be heard as soon as possible, as soon as it’s expedient.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.523" offset="4065468">As it turned out, in this case, these proceedings started in May and the hearing was held in November.</text>

            <text syncTime="1232.149" offset="5031999">Suppose the book dealer had 1,000 of the particular book that came under the ban of this statue in the view of the Commonwealth and you proceeded against one of them in the in rem proceeding, the book -- against the book itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.938" offset="5103156">Would it be a violation of the statute if this dealer gave the balance of the books away for nothing instead of selling them?</text>

            <text syncTime="1290.009" offset="5263444">I think that, probably, the criminal statute in Virginia might even prohibit the giving of these books to another person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.404" offset="5312972">Now, the question about the prior restraint, of course, as this Court knows and the record shows, there was no prior restraint in this case and, as Mr. Dietz says, advised the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.668" offset="5358007">The one thing I would like to call the Court’s attention is the fact that the record will show, it is not in the appendix but in the record, the trial record itself, it will show that Mr. Dietz agreed to continue this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.390" offset="5424880">So, this question of when the case started and when it ended is not exactly a matter of time that is really for this Court to consider in the prior restraint aspects, because, as this Court indicated in 37 Photographs, it said that no seizure or forfeiture will be invalidated for delay where the claimant is responsible for extending either the administrative action or judicial determination beyond allowable time limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.200" offset="5552149">So, I simply submit that, in this case, Mr. Dietz did not prosper any hearing in this matter and, in fact, going in and requested a continuance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1680.038" offset="6823476">As to the community standards, the First Amendment, in clear language, states that Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or press.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.496" offset="6869347">There’s no specific mention of the states in this amendment and the freedom of speech has been made applicable to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.820" offset="6910621">Therefore, what the states may constitutionally do in this area must be judged upon the language of the Fourteenth Amendment and not upon the language of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.168" offset="6951999">The question arises as how would a national standard be determined?</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.664" offset="6970075">Would each locality have to have its own set of “experts” to go around the country in order to ascertain what material is acceptable?</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.414" offset="7016991">How many people would be required to be interviewed?</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.608" offset="7029844">Would they be required to go into the rural areas as well as to the large metropolitan areas?</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.430" offset="7053040">If a national standard is required, we will be relegated to the type expert which the appellants presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.049" offset="7083551">It appears that this Dr. Hamlin, who was in the Georgia case, also appeared in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.689" offset="7114167">We get experts from out of state who come into town on the day of the trial and, in this case, the record shows that they spent no more than 10 or 15 minutes thumbing through not more than half of the books which were involved in this case and then making their opinions known to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.459" offset="7197236">We compare this to what the state experts did on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.534" offset="7213537">These people are all local people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.510" offset="7221373">They had examined each book thoroughly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.059" offset="7231613">They had knowledge of what the customs were and what the community standards were in Portsmouth, Virginia, and as Former Chief Justice Warren said in Jacobellis, he said he didn’t believe that there was a provable standard and that this Court had not been able to annunciate one, and it would be unreasonable to expect the local Courts to define one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.805" offset="7334640">As this Court said in Missouri versus Lewis, the Fourteenth Amendment does not profess to secure all persons in the United States to benefit the same laws and the same remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.833" offset="7378735">Great diversities, in this respect, may exist in two states, separated only by an imaginary line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.862" offset="7414784">When we get to the question which this Court asked counsel to brief and argue, the answer to the question of whether the display of any sexually oriented pictorial magazines for commercial sale were surrounded by notice to the public of that nature and by reasonable protection against exposure of the magazines to juveniles, the answer, I believe, to this question depends upon whether we’re talking about sexually oriented pictorial magazines which are obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.472" offset="7545292">If the magazines are, in fact, obscene, then there is not constitutional protection for the reason that in Roth this Court held that obscenity was not within the area of constitutionally protected speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.591" offset="7601716">This question was clearly answered, I believe, in the negative in United States versus Reidel decided in May of last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.845" offset="7634735">In Reidel, the jurisdictional statement was whether the government could constitutionally prohibit the distribution by the mails of obscene materials to willing recipients who state that they are adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.484" offset="7693354">To which question, this Court responded by holding that the government could prohibit discrimination of obscene material through the mails.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.717" offset="7726268">This Court expressly rejected the argument that Stanley, somehow, limited Roth and that the state and federal governments were constitutionally limited to prohibiting distribution of obscene materials to juveniles and unconsenting adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.929" offset="7791052">Stanley recognized that the states retain broad powers to regulate obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.921" offset="7815084">There’s being a espouse to proposition that since the President’s Commission on obscenity found no cause of relationship between pornography in any social conduct and sex crimes, then the states have no interest in protecting consenting adults from pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.423" offset="7881017">The position of the Commonwealth of Virginia is that this argument completely takes away from the states the right to reject the findings and conclusions of the President’s Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.110" offset="7923858">The Commission’s report has not only been rejected by the President, by the Senate, it has been criticized by the scholars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.803" offset="7954578">The Commission’s study did not explore the long range effects of frequent exposure to the obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.189" offset="7980178">At the time the Commission was concluding that public opinion did not support any legal restrictions on the right of adults to read or view explicit sexual material, the Gallup Opinion Index found 80% of the adult population bearing stricter laws on pornography and a Harris Poll, at the same time, found 76% of the population want pornography legislature -- literature outlawed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.630" offset="8085922">The Commission also reported that in Copenhagen, the rape -- a reported rape declined during the period in which pornography has been widely available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.061" offset="8123643">Therefore, the Commission concluded that there was no cause or connection between sex crimes and pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.223" offset="8152273">However, the Commission completely dismissed the fact that, in this country, adult arrest or forceful rapes increased 50% in the last decade when the availability of erotic material also increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.131" offset="8215907">The obscenity report published by Stein &amp; Day Publishers in 1970 found evidence of a demonstrable correlation between rising obscenity statistics and rising crime rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.893" offset="8266898">Within the last few weeks, a British study found that British society was threatened by the growth of pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.850" offset="8294797">Commonsense does suggest that if good literature can ennoble its readers, fowl literature can degrade them and that to depersonalize and derational -- romanticize sex may be damaging and certainly cannot be helpful to the development of happy human relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.435" offset="8377135">The people who are presently saying that a book does not corrupt are the very same ones who seemed convinced that displays of violence on television do indeed have the power to corrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.370" offset="8424887">The position of the Commonwealth is that in the question of the area of obscenity that this Court has specifically held in Roth and reiterated in Stanley and reiterated once again in Reidel and 37 Photographs that obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment and while it may true, and while it may be proven true at some time, that certain areas in this law should be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.059" offset="8543587">It’s the position of the Commonwealth that this matter rests in the hands of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.898" offset="8562918">And, we would ask this Court to affirm the judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2144.654" offset="8682036">Mr. Chief Justice Burger, I believe you asked the question regarding giving away of this material of this statute which appears on 19 (a) that deals only, in paragraph one, whenever he has reasonable cause to believe that any person is engaged in the sale or commercial distribution of any obscene book, etcetera, any citizen or the attorney for the commonwealth of any county, etcetera, may bring it to the attention of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.926" offset="8843055">Now, that is particularly interesting, because it says any citizen who has an interest and then we get to the issue of this injunction, because if you will consider the very final paragraph of the statute as it appears on 22 (a) of the petition for certiorari, paragraph 13, “It is expressly provided that the petition and proceeding, authorized under this article, relating to books alleged to be obscene, shall be intended only to establish scienter in, cases where the establishment of such scienter is thought to be useful or desirable by the petitioner.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.398" offset="9052975">“Only to establish scienter,” I cannot visualize how any common citizen who might be offended by the sale of a book would be concerned about scienter --</text>

            <text syncTime="2262.805" offset="9154644">I argued in the Supreme Court of Appeals in Virginia that this statute is vague and unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.446" offset="9181184">It contends no provision for granting an injunction, no provision for an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.189" offset="9216084">It only contends a provision for a temporary restraining order, and that is in paragraph 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.657" offset="9261955">And it does have, as its valid purpose, only to prove or establish scienter whenever it might be considered important by -- to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.110" offset="9315767">And, of course, in this case in the lower court and in this brief, I argued that the judge overstepped his balance in even granting this permanent injunction and he never granted a temporary restraining order.</text>
