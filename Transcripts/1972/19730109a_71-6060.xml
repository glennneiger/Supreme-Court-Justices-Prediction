            <label>Mr. Robert J. Hirsh</label>
            <text syncTime="44.327" offset="280639">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.687" offset="290147">If I could give the Court a brief presentation of the facts in this particular matter, Mr. Tacon was a soldier down at Fort Huachuca in 1969 and in February of that year he was arrested for unlawful sale of marihuana, he was claimed to have transferred a little of an ounce of marihuana to an undercover agent and as the result of that arrest was a charge in the Cochise County Superior Court in South Eastern Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.058" offset="395577">Mr. Tacon was given appointed counsel, he was released from his own recognizance, released back to his company commander and in the summer of the that year, he’d spent time consulting with his court-appointed attorney and if there was a continuance granted at the court-appointed attorney’s request.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.036" offset="463496">There was no time set after the motion for continuance was made, the trial judge didn’t set a time certain and in December of 1969, Mr. Tacon was discharged from the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.734" offset="502262">He called his court-appointed attorney said, “Mr. Whitney, I’ve got to go back to New York, I’m discharged from the service.”</text>
            <text syncTime="105.006" offset="523368">Mr. Whitney thereupon told Tacon, “That’s fine, give me your address back there and I’ll notify you when the trial comes up.”</text>
            <text syncTime="111.697" offset="550118">In March the 3rd --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="112.689" offset="554088">Was his release conditioned in any way on remaining within the jurisdiction of the court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_j_hirsh" startTime="117.354" stopTime="185.085">
            <label>Mr. Robert J. Hirsh</label>
            <text syncTime="117.354" offset="572792">No sir, it wasn’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.989" offset="575300">That was one of the issues that was raised in Cochise County at a hearing and the only restriction that Tacon had on was that his orders had been plugged and Tacon testified at that hearing that he didn’t know the meaning of that and all he understood was that he was to remain at Fort Huachuca as long as he was in the Army but he didn’t understand or have anyone tell him that he couldn’t go back to New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.052" offset="667564">The trial judge had a different belief as to that and the trial judge in fact had claimed that Tacon had violated his trust and violated the bail arrangement by leaving the state although, I think the record shows that Tacon did act on good faith when he went back to New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.888" offset="718973">He called the court-appointed attorney in Cochise County and also he had a federal charge that at that time was against him and he called the -- then the U.S. Commissioner in (Inaudible) and the bail restrictions and the federal charge did specify that he was not allowed to leave the State of Arizona without prior permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.566" offset="785638">Tacon called the U.S. Commissioner and got specific express permission to leave the State and then went to New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.978" offset="807267">So the state of the record indicates that at least he didn’t have any good faith plea for cause to believe that he was not allowed to leave the State of Arizona.</text>

            <text syncTime="191.407" offset="869021">I assume that he had some severance pay from the service, for the service provided wanting to get back to New York.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert J. Hirsh</label>
            <text syncTime="205.987" offset="927326">I’m almost certain that he was a New York resident.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.168" offset="935999">I just –- I don’t have a specific recollection of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.509" offset="945403">I know his family during the time he was in the service moved to Florida and that his mother was a Florida resident at the time this particular case came up for trial.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="217.588" stopTime="223.162">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="217.588" offset="973720">But did he consult his -- does the record show whether he consulted with his lawyer before he left Arizona?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_j_hirsh" startTime="223.162" stopTime="286.281">
            <label>Mr. Robert J. Hirsh</label>
            <text syncTime="223.162" offset="995976">Yes, it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.519" offset="1001409">The appendix shows that in fact, our hearing after the trial indicates that and the attorney verifies this that Tacon called the attorney on the phone and advised him that he is now being discharged from the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.154" offset="1043937">He told him he was going to New York and the attorney said, “Fine, you just give me your address in New York in order to enable me to locate you when the case is called for trial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="243.017" offset="1075388">So I think it’s clear from the record that Tacon did act in good faith when he went back to New York and fairly welcome as he didn’t violate the law based on my interpretation of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.128" offset="1115930">In any event, Tacon returns to New York and on March the 3rd, the trial judge by minute entry advised his counsel that the trial date is to be March 31, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.655" offset="1169951">The attorney, the court-appointed attorney after receiving notice of the trial date then writes a letter to Tacon and in this letter he merely states your trial is now set for March 31st, I want you to be out in Bisbee at least one week prior to the time set for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.983" offset="1227316">That was it, there was nothing about trial absentia if he wasn’t present, there is no more said.</text>

            <text syncTime="293.398" offset="1276949">Court procedures in Arizona sometimes we have long delays in Arizona and I should say, I shouldn’t make admissions like that but there’s no apparent explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.280" offset="1320521">It is common at least in my county to have delays of a year or year and a half depending on the court calendar.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.713" offset="1346226">It’s not common in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.964" offset="1351241">It is common in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.556" offset="1357615">They’re trying to resolve it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert J. Hirsh</label>
            <text syncTime="315.799" offset="1366601">Yes sir, that matter is through -- attempting to resolve these problems right now and speed up the trial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.064" offset="1395649">In any event, Tacon and I might add that the Arizona Supreme Court opinion is in error and the Attorney General is in error when they say that Tacon by that letter of March 3rd was advised that he would be tried in absentia, this is the only notice that Tacon received from his court-appointed lawyer that is the letter of March the 3rd.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.103" offset="1479764">Tacon receives as he testifies around the 8th or 9th of March and he now has -- finds himself with a short time to get up to Arizona and he has no funds, at least this is what he testifies to. On the 28th it is of March, he attempts to call the court-appointed attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.256" offset="1560430">This is on a Saturday and he calls the attorney in Wilcox, Arizona in his home and he is unable to reach him.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.725" offset="1590314">He again calls on Monday, that’s the first business day after the weekend and tells him, “I simply don’t have the funds to get to Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.504" offset="1621347">I don’t know what to do.”</text>
            <text syncTime="380.614" offset="1625840">And the court-appointed attorney, and I might add on the 24th the county-attorney of Cochise County gets wind off the fact that Tacon might not be available on Arizona for trial and the State is bringing a witness from El Reno, Oklahoma to testify and the county is anticipating spending some $1,000 in order to see this witness get to Cochise county.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.244" offset="1704312">The county attorney then advised of the Judge that there’s some question about Tacon appearing at trial and the judge says, well-- we submitted an entry on this part of the appendix in this case, the judge says that if he’s not here, we’re going to try him on absentia, there is minute entry to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.006" offset="1767424">The court-appointed attorney is advised with this and in the telephone conversation that occurs on March 30th.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.406" offset="1788949">He tells Tacon, this is the first time Tacon is advised that if he is not present in Arizona, the very next day that he will tried on absentia, and --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="430.067" offset="1823640">Do you suggest that he must be affirmatively advised to that effect?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert J. Hirsh</label>
            <text syncTime="434.175" offset="1840044">Well, this goes to the issue of waiver and I think it’s the States position that there was an a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to be present then the waiver is fortified by the claim that Tacon was specifically advised that he would be tried for absentia if he didn’t appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.641" offset="1897932">It simply isn’t the case at all and the fact of the matter is that he did -- was advised of the trial date by the letter of March the 3rd but that was the only notice he received and enough time to get to Arizona in order to be present for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.849" offset="1962820">In any event, the trial starts March 31st, the court-appointed lawyer appears before the Court and advises the court that there was a telephone conversation with the Tacon but Tacon didn’t have the funds to be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.303" offset="2024573">The judge who had apparently made up his mind from the week preview said, “You search the court area and see if this gentleman is around, and if he’s not around we’re going to try him absentia.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.036" offset="2063548">I am making a finding now pursuant to Arizona Rule of Procedure 231” that Tacon’s absence is voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.319" offset="2092596">Our rule provides that this finding is to be made at the outset of the trial and we’ll get into the distinction between Rule 43 and the Arizona Rule but in any event, the finding of voluntariness is made by the trial judge at the start of the trial prior to the commencement of trial that morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.860" offset="2166784">They go through the first day of trial; I might add parenthetically, there was a confession extracted from Tacon of a questionable voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.543" offset="2193533">This isn’t in the record but they had Tacon locked up for three hours after the sale was made and that Tacon was crying and after three hours of interrogation, he finally confessed that he in fact had sold a little marihuana to the undercover agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.760" offset="2258422">So that was an issue of that second day of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.879" offset="2266885">The first day of trial, they selected a jury and made opening statements and examined the first witness, the one from El Reno.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.352" offset="2292799">In the second day, the State had intended to present evidence of the confession for a voluntariness hearing outside the presence of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.831" offset="2326653">The court-appointed lawyer gets word after the first night of trial that Tacon’s mother now finds out that Tacon is supposed to be in Arizona and the mother is going to provide funds for Tacon to arrive in Arizona.</text>

            <text syncTime="586.428" offset="2449115">Tacon’s mother then called I believe Whitney, the court-appointed lawyer and thereafter hired a lawyer by the name Burt Levey in Miami to attempt to negotiate with Whitney to see that Tacon arrived in Arizona for trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1085.981" offset="4447274">Tacon received the sentence for five to five-and-a-half years in the Arizona State Penitentiary by this judge and short time after judgment was entered and sentence was passed, he filed a, he directed the county attorney to file an order to show cause ordering Tacon to show cause why he shouldn’t be held in contempt for failing to abide by the court’s order appearing at the time specified in the minute entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.706" offset="4546226">That was my fist appearance in the case and the result of that was that we had an evidentiary hearing on the question of whether or not Tacon willfully and intentionally absent himself from the jurisdiction and we didn’t get into the constitutional question although the hearing was akin to the issue that’s before the Court now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.645" offset="4621981">The trial judge after hearing all of the evidence took the matter under advisement and it is to this day still under advisement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1140.820" offset="4666702">He did state and I might add -- state virtuously on the record that after Tacon, at the close of the hearing, Tacon requested to make a statement to the court and at state he said, “Your Honor, I swore to you that I intended to be present at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.903" offset="4718947">I never intended to absent myself and I swore to you that what I’ve told you is the truth.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.220" offset="4740263">And the trial judge at that time said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.891" offset="4746951">“Mr. Tacon, I can assure you that I’m not in impress one bit with your stated intention at this time” and that was the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.805" offset="4774640">We took the appeal to the Arizona Supreme Court and it was on that language that the Arizona Supreme Court said that the trial judge apparently felt that this man willfully, intentionally absent himself from the jurisdiction and did not voluntarily waived his right to be present at the trial and they used that language as to, as a claim that the trial judge made a finding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2355.409" offset="9525060">That is the rule Mr. Justice White, they had recently probably under the pressure from this Court and the federal courts, been considering the federal constitutional questions when they are raised for the first time with them but that rule is of longstanding, but unless it is presented first to the trial court to give the trial court a chance to correct its own mistake, it will not consider it on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.046" offset="9623594">As I say they’ve been ignoring that tacitly in recent decisions when it has been constitutional question that is first presented and I think rightly so because otherwise they can go to the Federal District Court on a writ of habeas and there was no question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.359" offset="9684825">Alright, this case for me at least has been one that was difficult to get ahead along in the beginning and I think that was because of three particular reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.592" offset="9741772">The first reason being the claim of poverty, poverty seemed to raise the constitutional question that we have run roughshod over somebody’s rights over some poor persons right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.289" offset="9792554">I think also because of the claim that there had been no hearing on voluntariness and untimely of course when I searched the record, we found that the trial judge made no express decision after he had heard all of the testimony on his motion for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.659" offset="9857964">But really, the only issues of this case could ever present whether before this Court or before the Arizona Supreme Court would be two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.440" offset="9889102">One is the constitutionality of Arizona’s Rule 231 and the second issue would be dependent upon the resolution of the first and that would be granted that rule as constitutional was there sufficient evidence before the court to sustain the finding if only an implied finding which it did make.</text>
