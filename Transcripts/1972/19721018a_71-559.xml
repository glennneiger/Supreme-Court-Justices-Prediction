          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_r_sachse" startTime="35.740" stopTime="152.901">
            <label>Mr. Harry R. Sachse</label>
            <text syncTime="35.740" offset="246366">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.413" offset="257024">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.747" offset="282311">The issue presented by the case is the following: when the Government condemns land for public project, must it pay for the value added to the land by a permit to graze cattle on adjacent public land, and I can refine that one step further; when that permit is admittedly a revocable permit that the Government can revoke without payment of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.876" offset="406862">The factual situation in which the case arose is the following: Government determined that it was necessary to build a dam as a flood-control project on the Bill Williams River in Arizona, an area that is subject to flash floods.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.447" offset="477184">Mr. Fuller owned three tracts of land in the vicinity of this project.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.179" offset="504038">It was the total -- about 1,280 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.769" offset="526399">It was necessary for the Government to take two of those tracts that totaled 920 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.177" offset="552103">It was not necessary for the Government to take the third and third tract was not taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.667" offset="570075">In connection with his land, Mr. Fuller for a number of years had been using 30,000 acres of federal grazing land to graze his cattle in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.523" offset="613439">He used that land under permit issued under Section 5 of the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.491" offset="653354">Section 5 permit, now, I will talk about in a little more detail later, is a revocable permit that by statute does not create any right, title or interest in the public land.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="152.901" offset="715003">Mr. Sachse, does it have a term stated however even though it is revocable?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Harry R. Sachse</label>
            <text syncTime="159.364" offset="740812">The term is not stated in the statue except that it cannot exceed 10 years as an administrative regulation and practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.507" offset="781354">The permits are issued year by year.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.182" offset="792116">The permit has to be reissued each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.738" offset="806327">They are customarily reissued to the same person and had them the year before, but the permit is for one year.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="182.073" offset="831613">There isn't any formal procedure for termination, isn’t it or is there?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_r_sachse" startTime="189.944" stopTime="281.900">
            <label>Mr. Harry R. Sachse</label>
            <text syncTime="189.944" offset="863169">If -- I think there is a formal procedure for termination and to this extent that if a man applies for the permit for a second year and the Government determines not to grant the permit the second year, the Government will allow him to -- it will state its reasons why the permits not being granted and will allow him to state his reasons why he thinks the permit should be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.666" offset="986049">It's not -- the Government won’t deny a permit just out of hand, but the permits are revocable and often when the property is needed for another purpose or the property hasn’t been properly used are revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.743" offset="1054386">Now, there’s a peculiarity of this case that needs to be kept in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.686" offset="1086151">The Government did not revoke Mr. Fuller’s grazing permit when it took these two tracts of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.303" offset="1112586">The reason it didn’t do so is that it didn’t take his third tract of land and he was free to continue to use this permit in connection with the third tract of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.811" offset="1154591">In Arizona, the basis for having a grazing permit is having sufficient water for the cattle that roam on the federal land to use on the private land and he had sufficient water apparently on his third tract of land and so far as we know, Mr. Fuller is still using this permit.</text>

            <text syncTime="281.900" offset="1230973">And it’s your contention, I take it that the department -- was it, agriculture or interior?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_r_sachse" startTime="287.134" stopTime="288.250">
            <label>Mr. Harry R. Sachse</label>

            <text syncTime="288.250" offset="1256364">The Department of the Interior will not take a jaundiced view of the renewal of his permit because he has less fee land now than he did before?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_r_sachse" startTime="297.781" stopTime="493.056">
            <label>Mr. Harry R. Sachse</label>
            <text syncTime="297.781" offset="1294503">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.338" offset="1296697">It has not done so as far as I understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.748" offset="1330343">Actually, part of what brings this case here is that the Department of the Interior has been very generous with the use of this land because if the Department of Interior had revoked his use of the 30,000 acres of public land before it took the land in question, at least according to the jurisprudence in the Courts of Appeal, up to this point, there wouldn't have been no question at all that he would have had no right to ask the jury to evaluate his use of the public land along with his use of his private land and it’s our contention that it’s just nonsense to say that this revocable permit creating less than a property right and the public land that could have been revoked; gives him a right to additional compensation because the Government chose not to revoke it.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.687" offset="1542144">If the Government now took his next piece of land, the third of piece of land, under the ruling of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.459" offset="1569207">The Government would have to pay again for the same permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.173" offset="1604106">Now, in the trial of the case, Mr. Fuller relied heavily on the number of cows that could be grazed on his land plus the public land and obtained an instruction from the trial judge that the jury could take into account his use of the public land and giving him compensation for his private land so long as it also took into account the fact that the public land was held under revocable permits that those permits could be revoked without payment of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.935" offset="1751124">The jury returned a verdict of $350,000 for the 920 acres of ranch land that was taken and the Government appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.705" offset="1794173">The Ninth Circuit divided on the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.387" offset="1812877">The majority held that because the permit had not been revoked distinguishing this from the situation with permit had already been revoked, he had a right to get the value of the public land along with the value of his private land and I should say that more accurately.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.305" offset="1880586">He had a right in determining the value of his private land to have added to that any special value provided by the use of the public land.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.732" offset="1926248">The Court was at pains to distinguish this Court’s decision in United States versus Rands which in a rather similar situation had held exactly to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.300" offset="1972537">The man had private land along a river and had a special value added to that land by its possible uses of port site that the Government in taking the land would not have to pay the special port site value that was added.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.759" offset="2050382">The dissenting judge found that the decision in Rands was controlling in this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="493.056" stopTime="510.558">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="493.056" offset="2075564">Where is the -- the land has been overruled by the Congress or at least in the narrow facts of Rands, it has been pretty well run over I think.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_r_sachse" startTime="510.558" stopTime="627.897">
            <label>Mr. Harry R. Sachse</label>
            <text syncTime="510.558" offset="2145573">I don’t think so at all Your Honor and Mr. Burch argues that but I think it points out a very essential distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.184" offset="2180159">In Rands, this Court held that as a constitutional matter, Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States provides that just compensation for the taking of private property for public use does not include the value of any special use in public property and the fact situation there was the public property was the use of the water way for the port site -- the use of the property of riparian property for a port site and the court relied on the Government’s navigational servitude saying that the Government decides whether someone can or cannot use navigable waters for a port site.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.580" offset="2345671">Now Congress, after that case passed an act that said that where riparian land is taken in one situation -- that where the entirety of the riparian property is taken for harbor improvements or river improvements that any special value that it has as a port site can be included in the valuation of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.686" offset="2470118">I have two points to make here.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.869" offset="2482866">One it's not at all unusual for this Court to say what the constitutional requirement is for just compensation and if the Congress then to provide more if it thinks in a particular situation then it should do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.624" offset="2541902">And secondly, the Congressional Act doesn't go nearly as far as the Rands case went.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.777" offset="2558516">The Rands case created a broad principle that would apply to any riparian taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.560" offset="2585579">Congressional Act applied only if the entirety if a man’s land is taken which by the way was not the case here.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="627.897" stopTime="634.946">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="627.897" offset="2614941">And it’s just a statutory decision would have capability of overruling the constitutional conspiracy?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_r_sachse" startTime="634.946" stopTime="641.864">
            <label>Mr. Harry R. Sachse</label>
            <text syncTime="634.946" offset="2643153">It's a Statutory Act without capability of overruling a constitutional decision.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="641.864" stopTime="649.418">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="641.864" offset="2670843">Well nonetheless, Congress gets its way in this case because as you say Congress can grant more than the Fifth Amendment requires it to give?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_r_sachse" startTime="649.418" stopTime="804.378">
            <label>Mr. Harry R. Sachse</label>
            <text syncTime="649.418" offset="2701040">And Congress could get its way in this case if Congress did something that it has not done, and that is to declare that a Taylor Grazing Act permit, on Section 3 of Taylor Grazing Act creates a vested right of property interest in land.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.579" offset="2769690">Congress not only hasn’t done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.823" offset="2778676">It has resisted suggestions that it should do so and it particularly chose not to do so when it had both possibilities in mind and I would like to elaborate on that a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.526" offset="2837504">In the 1890s, ranchers in the west used the public land absolutely as if it were their own and it led to a bad situation of range warfares into the destruction of the range land through overgrazing.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.297" offset="2904586">In 1891, Congress had first time tried to do something about that and it passed the Forest Service Act and included some range land in the Forest’s Service Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.474" offset="2953279">But the Government under the Forest Service Act, that was the Secretary of Agriculture would not permit grazing on the public land except by permits that he would issue for a limited a period of time revocable if the land were needed for other purposes or if the land were abused.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.328" offset="3044707">Now, the ranchers in the west strenuously objected to this as taking away their vested right to use the range as they saw fit and they brought the case all the way to this Court, Light versus the United States, United States versus Light and I think its in 220 U.S., it’s cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.103" offset="3123806">In Light, this Court strongly upheld the right of the Government to treat the public domain land as a propriety and to either grant or not grant rights to private individuals to use the public domain and if it granted rights to private individuals to determine how much that right should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.969" offset="3199248">And in 1934, when Congress passed the Taylor Grazing Act, it set up two separate systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.865" offset="3230804">Set up one system under Section 13 of the act in which a rancher could get a leasehold interest in a part of the public ranch, but it only set that up small or non-contiguous tracts of land, and that would be an interest protected from expropriation without payment of its value.</text>

            <text syncTime="1712.051" offset="6951581">Counsel has indicated to the Court, I think erroneously that -- and perhaps inadvertently in response to a question that Fuller remained in business, that he was still operating around, these are the statements there as the record, they are not accurate and it simply points up the danger of applying the Rands analogy to these kind of cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1747.829" offset="7094732">Only that I think that the possibilities of less than adequate compensation are present and the indication would be with counsel saying do that the Rands is still in existence and operating is not effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.046" offset="7155545">Matter of fact, matter was that the compensation that was received wasn’t enough to cover the existing debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.292" offset="7176547">So if it’s a thing the Court, I don’t think should consider in any event that it was there and the statement was inaccurate when it was made to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.109" offset="7215835">The U.S versus Jaramillo case which has been remarked onto the Court in oral presentation and which is briefed is directly in point with Fuller as we understand it, and I think it stands for the proposition, not as counsel has stated that one must be paid or subsidized, but that it simply means you can take into consideration in determining the market value of a ranch, the availability and the accessibility of permit land, and that's really all that the Court instructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.306" offset="7360554">Judge Craig in the District Court was extremely careful not to distinguish Rands which he didn't know about at the time, but to follow Jaramillo which we consider to be the law and certainly a well reasoned conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.590" offset="7417710">He did tell the jury as we have pointed out to you that they must recognize the possibility of Government revocation of the permits and the leases and incidentally the question I believe one of the justices remarked on, there was state land involved in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.752" offset="7482389">There was 30,000 acres of federal lease land, 12,000 acres of state land which the applicant owned and approximately 1,200 acres of fee land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.549" offset="7533589">Also, there was some indication that the reason BOM did not revoke these leases was the remainder of the fee land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.019" offset="7567444">The fact of the matter is that had nothing to do with the case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.448" offset="7577161">It was isolated across the river and it couldn’t be made accessible under any set of circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1935.410" offset="7844968">But nonetheless, I think the court properly instructed and the jury was properly aware that these values, if there was any value in the permits, must not be considered and the testimony in the case was quite clear that those who testified as the value distinguished the permit land and reduced the total value of the fee land by whatever they felt was the value of the permit land.</text>

            <text syncTime="2280.754" offset="9226428">Well, we wanted to make sure that our appraisers, Justice Rehnquist, could testify as to what in fact a cow/calf operation was, and we wanted to get before the court and the jury as much information as possible about the very nature of the operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.858" offset="9290794">It was completely distinguishable from, as I have indicated to you, a steer operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.553" offset="9309602">We felt that any appraiser that got in and I simply said, I looked at 1,000 acres of land without understanding what it was, couldn't come up with an intelligent evaluation, and we felt that that kind of testimony in the light of Jaramillo was absolutely a necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.360" offset="9372818">Otherwise, they would simply have been saying, we have a 1,200 acres or whatever the case maybe which we will pretend is not the cow/calf operation which is its highest and best use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.562" offset="9425586">I might at this point digress for a moment and remark on Rands and its ultimate effect, I think upon ranchers and people with riparian fast land holdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.562" offset="9481592">As I read it, the Government's case and as I understand their position in this matter, their position basically is that if you are adjacent in the case of Rands to a navigable stream or body of water and you own fee land and it is condemned by the Government, then you cannot consider any use that that land might have relating to accessibility to the water, to the navigable stream or body of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.507" offset="9625370">And counsel says, they want a very limited interpretation of this case and that its application perhaps by assumption and would be limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.937" offset="9663091">But in all the western states, in fact all of the states in the country bordering on big rivers, Arizona, particularly where I come has the Colorado, a whole city has been built on the Colorado on fee land, secured from the state of Arizona, and they call it Havasu City.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.703" offset="9726203">They built the London Bridge there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.795" offset="9734562">That use is specifically because the Colorado River is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.831" offset="9754728">If I follow the Government's reasoning and the application of Rands, what they are saying if it is necessary for the Federal Government to go to Havasu City, take the bridge, the houses, the resorts, the restaurants, the recreation area on fee land immediately adjacent to that river, but solely related to the presence of that river, they don't have to pay the fair market value of that land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.885" offset="9842918">They have the legal fiction that because it is adjacent to a navigable stream, it has value only without the application of that stream.</text>

            <text syncTime="2548.249" offset="10296404">We would then be talking about a cow/calf operation with 12,000 state acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.605" offset="10317824">As the case was, we were talking about a cow/calf operation with 12,000 state acres and 32,000 federal acres immediately adjacent to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.271" offset="10348440">So it would only been a small matter of degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.628" offset="10361919">As our witnesses testified some years on that land that the Government saves as valuable subsidy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.416" offset="10385011">You are lucky if you can run a cow on a section that 640 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.082" offset="10399744">Sometimes maybe you get a cow to a thousand acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.688" offset="10414164">The answer if the Government feels it's being undone by the subsidy to simply raise the rental which they have every right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.452" offset="10465155">We have made comment in our brief to the Court that there is another point to be considered in this matter and that is simply the proposition that while Rands may control the compensation under a taking or did control until the amendment that which reduced its effectiveness and I think indicates a congressional change in the onerous rule of Rands that while Rands may control as to riparian fast lands, that is a situation where the Government has exercised its full authority in the law under the Commerce Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.051" offset="10623561">That in Taylor Grazing Act land, the Government has done something less than make this full exercise of its power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.948" offset="10651146">It has said to ranchers, if you go out and build and develop a ranch and that what occurred in this instance and you make improvements, we will rent to you adjacent lands for your use and in this instance, I think the analogy of the Monongahela case which we cite which said, I believe as I recall, though it held sometimes basically in the area of estoppel, that you come it at the implied or expressed invitation of the Government in making improvement, then you should be compensated for it, that is an exception to the fast land cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.884" offset="10778937">The Twin City case which we cited to the court in our brief, specifically holding against in that instance the land owner still stood for the proposition that if there is this implied consent, if there is this invitation to come in and use land, then the Government must take you as it finds you when it determines compensation for a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.352" offset="10900773">We feel that the cases cited to support the Government's position deal basically with loss of possible future opportunities or frustrated business opportunities or a destruction of a business as oppose to a taking of land or possibly the loss of a renewal expectancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.238" offset="10980289">When we are basically talking in Fuller about the taking of a thousand acres and the very heart of a cow/calf operation which could not be restored after the taking, and that this operation had incidentally to its use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.542" offset="11041520">Of course, it was lease land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.885" offset="11046954">It was there and existed, the Government leases and the state leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.059" offset="11067643">We think that the instruction of the District Court judge was a fair one and that it was calculated to make sure that the owner got just compensation, not a subsidy, but simply whatever the value of that land was and the light of its then existing use and to the light of the adjacent land to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3336.787" offset="13450533">Now here, at page 25 of the appendix is Mr. Fuller himself testifying, and he is describing his lands, he says, well, it has of course fine water and very fine climate for growing the kind of crops that we have to have.</text>
