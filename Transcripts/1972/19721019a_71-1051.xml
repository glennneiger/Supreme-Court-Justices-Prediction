            <label>Mr. Robert Eugene Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="47.097" offset="292739">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.215" offset="305277">This case originated in the City of Atlanta when the respondents filed a complaint seeking in essence a declaratory judgment and injunction to prohibit of the showing of two movies.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.981" offset="380301">This comes about because the theatre, the Paris Adult Theatre, had two separate sections to it where separate films were being shown and one would walk in to the cashier and go in one or go in the other.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="84.826" stopTime="86.375">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="84.826" offset="443726">There was a common lobby and --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_eugene_smith" startTime="86.375" stopTime="584.303">
            <label>Mr. Robert Eugene Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="86.375" offset="449891">Common lobby, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.985" offset="456370">And then the door would open to the particular film they wanted to go see.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.953" offset="480193">The complaint filed by the prosecutor, by the prosecution or the respondents in this case sought a temporary injunction to stop the showing of the film pending the hearing on the permanent injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.717" offset="539230">Fortuitously, the Judge did not sign that broad of a temporary restraining order merely to sought to stop the petitioners in this case from taking the films out of the jurisdiction or altering, or removing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.595" offset="602760">A hearing was scheduled in January and ultimately on January 13th, 1971 the films were produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.021" offset="644451">Their evidence produced before the Court indicated that this theatre had its outside was painted so that no one could see inside and there were several legends on the windows, to the extent for adults only, you must be 21 and be able to prove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.829" offset="723759">If viewing the nude body offends you, do not enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.331" offset="737761">The fore warning of the character of the material which one might expect to find therein was clearly stated on the outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.253" offset="769421">The prosecution at the time of the presentation of its case, brought in several witnesses who had viewed the movie.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.337" offset="805784">These were investigators in the office of the Solicitor, and they indicated that these films showed explicit sexual acts of cunnilingual, fellatio, and intercourse.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.107" offset="872866">The Trial Judge, after viewing the movies found they did not show these explicit acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.042" offset="904526">They were simulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.348" offset="909751">The Supreme Court of Georgia said, “Well, it doesn’t leave really much to the imagination and its close enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.071" offset="932634">And besides, we thought the acts which in essence were simulated in I Am Curious (Yellow), that this is the same kind of thing, we thought was obscene in I Am Curious (Yellow), and the Supreme Court of United States has not reversed in that case, and so as far as we are concerned, this is hardcore pornography.”</text>
            <text syncTime="224.355" offset="1001806">That was just the title they threw on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.143" offset="1009016">Even though there were no explicit sexual acts consummated in this particular film, sort of in a sense of the language of this Court in Rabe versus Washington, when it was talking about certain types of films.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.484" offset="1090309">The Court as I said issued its order and held these were not hardcore pornography, that there were no minors involved, and that as far as the Court was concerned, they were tasteless, vulgar, childish, unimaginative, boring, but as far its concern, it was protected by the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.497" offset="1170348">The State Supreme Court reversed and we are here on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.486" offset="1190306">We pointed out initially in our brief that the procedural -- there were no procedural guidelines for this taking process in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.090" offset="1236804">There is no statute that permits this, there is no authority, no judicial construction that will say, that as far as the Court will hear it on a certain day, the Court will decide within a certain number of days as to its decision in this particular matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.080" offset="1304722">We say the procedural safeguards are lacking.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.529" offset="1314544">They are not there, but yet the state has or been allowed to do it in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.815" offset="1343697">But more importantly, we’d like to direct their argument to the question suggested by this Court with regard to the display of sexually oriented films.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.110" offset="1388837">My brother in his brief would interpret the terminology, any sexually oriented films as meaning obscene films.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.188" offset="1425199">I interpret that in slightly different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.688" offset="1439096">We view this as being whatever the definition, whatever definition of the members of this Court, whatever definition is supplied by statute, whether it's something to the left of Pinocchio on up to the extremes that Mr. Moran has cited in his brief, whatever -- however will you define, whatever denominator you use to define and aside from the specific definition, is there a Constitutional right to offer this for dissemination in a commercial theatre where there are no children admitted and where there are some note of notice, some warning on the outside of the theatre as to the character of the material being offered there.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.361" offset="1601891">Now my brother would say, “Yes, but there was no sign that said cunnilingual activity depicted, no sign that said fellatio, just said if the nude body offends you, please don’t enter.”</text>
            <text syncTime="383.275" offset="1637522">But the first time we put a sign out that said, Cunnilingual activity in, fellatio in, they maybe hauling us in and charging us with pandering, which in essence what they did in other cases in that jurisdiction where that particular matter was present on the outside of the theatre.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.822" offset="1691648">So in this context, this is what we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.932" offset="1708157">Addressing ourselves to the greater point, we don’t think that Roth necessarily is inconsistent with the argument we’re making today.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.023" offset="1740445">This Court in essence did say in Roth that “Yes, obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="415.144" offset="1765000">But it went on to say that the door barring federal encroachment into this area must be kept tightly closed to prevent encroachment upon more important interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.295" offset="1809617">We suggest that the Redrup cases which in essence started a trend in which there are approximately 33 or 34 cases reversed per curiam, let us gently from a point of focusing on the expression, to focusing on conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.099" offset="1892791">It is as Mr. Fliesman pointed out with regard to the California Attorney General who was walking down the street last night, we do not have in this record any reference to anyone standing outside of the theatre and hustling them in as you might find at a night club or something like that, nothing whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.931" offset="1968128">There is absolutely no hustling or any way pandering, however, you might define those terms involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.334" offset="2005744">We suggest that the right of the disseminator to assert his position although he is not necessarily the viewer, is clear from a variety of cases held by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.682" offset="2059139">One of the key points that the Court has made with regards to First Amendment, is that if they are not the procedural safeguards, we are going to have an inducement of self censorship and when one induces the self censorship, then in essence the public is the loser.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.111" offset="2132804">The public is the loser and in prosecutions undertaken without -- in this context, sure they can be punished if there is going to be an intrusion, but we do not have it in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.467" offset="2190273">There is not in this case the problem that might be presented in a magazine or a bookstore where the book is taken out of the store and left in a trashcan, and the possibility it maybe found by children.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.346" offset="2241787">We have a film, in a commercial theatre where people can go and view it.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.698" offset="2263207">In Carr Lexus versus Burn reversed by this Court on other grounds, the lower court held that if Stanley in essence can watch a film of any kind, any sexually oriented film, sexually explicit film in the privacy of his home, why can’t a few fellows get together and watch it in a commercial setting and have just the same sense of privacy and the same sense of protection and we suggest that makes good sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.477" offset="2366339">We pointed out in our brief that approximately 600 millions of dollars are spent in a year on the sale of and or exhibition of sexually explicit material and that’s an awful lot of public support for an interest in sexually explicit material.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="596.720" offset="2491308">A lot of people will be put out of work though --[Laughter]</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_eugene_smith" startTime="601.722" stopTime="995.782">
            <label>Mr. Robert Eugene Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="601.722" offset="2511266">Well, I think Mr. Clancy, my brother who has the amicus brief in this case probably would feel they will be put out of work, but in this context, we think that the focus on action on the conduct of the disseminator would not be inconsistent with the protection of the right of the public under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.204" offset="2585245">We are not as in Reidel conceding that these films are obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.680" offset="2599142">In Reidel for the purpose of the motion to dismiss, there was a concession that for that matter assume the films are obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.871" offset="2627877">We’re saying something different.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.259" offset="2633415">We’re saying that the definition of whether the films are obscene, is not relevant until an impermissible intrusion occurs by the act of the disseminator in thrusting upon someone or by having involved with minors in that particular case, just does not exist here.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.578" offset="2698721">So we say it is not inconsistent for this to have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.931" offset="2720141">We also have argued and set forth that the film itself, regardless of the argument that we make on the right of an adult, the right of a disseminator to show films in a adult theatre, that these films are not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.061" offset="2776670">They are not unlike films for instance involved in the Hartstein case, films that were involved in a Wiener case.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.373" offset="2801852">And these points out the difficulty we suggest why this Court shouldn’t annunciate broader protection and a positive protection to eliminate the difficulty inherent in trying to fit a definition because in some states, prurient interest is defined as shameful and morbid.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.450" offset="2882205">Now there is -- it is an itching sensation, I think using the term -- some of the terminology taken from a marginal note by Mr. Justice Brennan in the Roth case using that phraseology.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.550" offset="2926613">And then prurient means so many different things to so many different people and then the question of community standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.591" offset="2946779">Are we talking about some standard to which we all should aspire?</text>
            <text syncTime="714.488" offset="2962348">Getting married for life and never having an extra marital affair and never getting divorced.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.064" offset="2984605">But is that what the community really does?</text>
            <text syncTime="721.744" offset="2991397">Sure!</text>
            <text syncTime="722.079" offset="2992755">That is something.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.572" offset="2994636">That is the ideal, that’s what we really hope aspire to but then in this context, is the community standard, that which we should aspire to, or is it that which we find ourselves in today and is there a single standard in our community?</text>
            <text syncTime="737.320" offset="3053672">We suggest there is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.480" offset="3058270">There are many -- there’s a standard of different groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.339" offset="3069764">It's clear in surveys taken whether they are political surveys, whether they’re sex research surveys, that there is a conservative element in our society, there is a liberal element in our society, and there are a lot of people who just don’t care one way or the other or at least don’t show a great deal of positive interest in responding.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.903" offset="3136010">We’ve indicated that there were community attitude surveys by the Presidential Commission on Pornography and Obscenity, where several millions of dollars were spent, taking a survey on a demographic basis throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.342" offset="3181777">And one of the conclusions were that many people felt as Mr. Justice White pointed out in Reidel that there is a developing sentiment where people and adult should be allowed to read and see what they want to see and in essence, that’s what the public said.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.972" offset="3236321">Now again, taking a definition, what is a community standard, and when we talk about candor, what is the duty of candor?</text>
            <text syncTime="790.469" offset="3266309">We may tolerate homosexuality in our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.174" offset="3277072">It’s not our bag, but it's there, it exists, it's part of it, but yet, if you discuss it, if you depict it in some ways, it maybe said, “No, it’s wrong because that’s not what a normal person does in our society.”</text>
            <text syncTime="806.549" offset="3330570">Going on to the concept of social value; some jurisdictions have eliminated or trying to eliminate by referendum, the concept of social value in an obscenity litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.465" offset="3374247">It is the fact that a material which is pruriently appealing, it is the fact that a material exceeds contemporary community standards, but if it has some slight modicum of social value, as the Memoirs decision, is this enough to protect it and communities are trying to do way with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.972" offset="3440285">Then there’s a problem of the local versus the national and how local is local, and how national is national.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.803" offset="3463586">This presents a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.176" offset="3469124">The Courts are literally flooded with obscenity cases and I know that this Court has a great many of them that have found their way up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.239" offset="3509352">There are lots of cases on appeals in Federal Courts and State Courts which are awaiting the decision of this Court in this case on these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.124" offset="3540908">There are many cases being made almost daily in the lower courts and which will ultimately find their way up to the Appellate Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.466" offset="3574241">And depending on who the judges are that you’re sitting in front of and how he views the words of this Court in context or out of context, the jury instructions and such given, make it very difficult, make it very difficult for there to be the uniformity that there should be in the application of a national constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.346" offset="3645816">And thus we get back to the point where the focus we suggest should be on conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.738" offset="3671312">If we want to go out and to talk about a political candidate, it's one thing, but if we are going to do it at 2 o’clock in the morning in a residential neighborhood, then the right of freedom of speech is ended right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.409" offset="3714048">It’s not the right of course to do it anytime, anyplace that you want.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.653" offset="3727005">You can’t block ingress and egress if you’re going to do picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.226" offset="3737349">In the same sense here, no one forces these people to go in this door.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.602" offset="3750828">It is the right of the individual to choose and if the right of the disseminator here to assert the right of the citizen who might want to see this, we’re doing this in an essence if the Court were to go to this point, then the self censorship factor would be eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.992" offset="3816344">And I think that is Mr. Justice Brennan has pointed out in the past in some of his decisions that the public would really then be in a position to choose, view, and disregard what it is and then it is the mature and free society that should be allowed to make that choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.647" offset="3895024">It should not be jurors focused in the public light where they feel they must react because there is a community pressure if they say it’s not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.665" offset="3935044">Somebody will think they are dirty old men.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.547" offset="3942567">This is the concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.334" offset="3945702">We eliminate these things by focusing on the conduct, so that if there is a public display, then this is eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.875" offset="3971929">The State of Oregon for instance now has litigated or has passed the statute and there can be no prosecution for obscenity unless there is a public display of the material by the public highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.660" offset="4023024">In an adult only bookstore, in an adult only theatre, it's okay as long as they are not juveniles involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.669" offset="4047057">The State of Hawaii has now passed the same kind of law as the State of Oregon, again holding this.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.283" offset="4073493">There is -- this is the kind of law that should exist --</text>

            <text syncTime="1274.589" offset="5202714">I filed this suit and have been involved with it since very inception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.241" offset="5225388">There existed at that time in Georgia three basic types of procedure, one was strictly civil, one was strictly criminal, and one was civil leading toward the criminal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.420" offset="5306055">Now, before I was in office in this particular case, the Solicitor traveled the criminal route.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.317" offset="5349627">He was stopped in Gable versus Jenkins and the Federal District Court says “No, you must first have a prior adversary hearing before seizing the material.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.479" offset="5406260">And therefore, we started the civil proceedings as a prior adversary proceeding leading to the seizure of the film for criminal prosecution purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.793" offset="5463521">I might add at this juncture, that this is not anyhow imposed upon us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.880" offset="5491942">The Federal Court says there they were mixing the apples and oranges, civil and criminal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.714" offset="5515243">And it complicated matters and as long as the Court would stick with the civil process on the one hand and the absolute criminal process on the other, we had a clear and defined area, that the criminal process would inherit it, grant to the person a far greater protection than any civil injunction could grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.967" offset="5600298">Nevertheless, the outline or the method of using an injunction was suggested indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.508" offset="5642407">Then we started that process, and a petition was filed alleging that the film in this case was obscene, setting out a factual description of the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.719" offset="5707295">We showed it was being exhibited to the general public on a fee basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.210" offset="5729238">We asked the Court to restrain and enjoin them from further showing the film.</text>

            <text syncTime="1579.819" offset="6423677">For you see, unlike most states since 1877, Georgia enacted a Constitutional provision which reads “Liberty of speech or of the press guarantee, no law shall ever be passed to curtail or restrain the liberty of speech or of the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.033" offset="6516569">Any person may speak right and publish his sentiments on all subjects being responsible for the abuse of that liberty.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.237" offset="6557320">Now on that statute or because of that statute, I personally filed suit in K. Gordon Murray Productions versus Floyd and challenged the censorship ordinances in the City of Atlanta, Georgia in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.926" offset="6628059">The ordinances I contended then were infected with the vice in Teitel and the Georgia Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional, as abridging this particular provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.554" offset="6686574">And said that they could show what they please but they are going to be responsible for that to show and if it amounts to criminal acts in nature they can be punished for the criminal acts in nature, just as you can have a gun legitimately on person and that’s all right or in your home, but if you use that gun for an illegal purpose that is something else again and that is a procedure that we adopted in the State of Georgia.</text>

            <text syncTime="1801.397" offset="7309960">There is a big conflict in what you see and what they say you see.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.232" offset="7353323">They would bring in expert witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.549" offset="7358548">I think remark was made here today that it does not clearly depict certain acts, that you'd have to use your imagination and some of these experts testify that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.520" offset="7410479">But in the New Orleans Bookmark case, I think it was Judge Brown who observed this in his opinion, thus one defense witness testified that a particular photograph did not depict cunnilingus, but only suggested it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.096" offset="7476830">This is a photograph of a nude female with photographic focus on the genital area, showing a male head face a few inches away, mouth open and tongue out and the witness said, “That just suggests something, it does not show anything.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.101" offset="7544748">We get down to the next issue, they make a professional witness or expert witnesses and this is where we get into an unusual area because the so called expert witnesses fall in two categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.965" offset="7624265">One, nothing is obscene and two, everything is obscene, which leaves the jurors sitting neutral again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.773" offset="7675465">So, as in this case, any witness who is a personable fellow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.052" offset="7704618">They brought in a hired gun and that’s what he is, he is a hired gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.483" offset="7722277">He comes there for purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.289" offset="7729591">He could give no concern about what happened and his hired gun is usually a non resident, he just comes riding in and he services a contract before, before he views the material, which is true in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.977" offset="7788314">This man got on the airplane, flew to Atlanta, had an agreement, how much he’s going to be paid, he’s going to testify, he didn't see anything he will testify about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.536" offset="7818512">As the matter of fact he has seen both of these films entirely, but we let that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.313" offset="7841604">This testimony is all prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.639" offset="7854979">He arrives at trial prepared to go on the stand and his testimony won’t vary between a dozen cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.894" offset="7891968">In this case, Dr. Darryl didn’t see the film until the trial was in progress and he only saw a part of Magic Mirror, but this didn’t deter his testimony one iota and he went (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.892" offset="7959991">Then he testified and he collects his bounty, and rides off in the setting sun, to prepare his testimony to any who wants to buy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.682" offset="8003145">And he candidly compares, he says no sexually oriented material is obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.700" offset="8023207">He is for sale, he is for hire and that’s all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.303" offset="8045568">In United States versus Brown, the Court made a reference to one of these hired guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.191" offset="8077124">And they said, “Referring to the photographs and the two books Dr. Hammond stated they would appeal to some homosexuals, but not necessarily anymore than Sears &amp; Roebuck catalog.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.955" offset="8128219">Likewise, Dr. Hammond indicated that these books were no more revolting than a television commercial showing a man brushing his teeth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.728" offset="8163328">The realm of psychiatry is indeed highly technical and beyond the understanding of layman, but these conclusions seem absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.935" offset="8200108">It goes without saying that the difference between a Sears &amp; Roebuck catalog or a toothpaste advertisement and these two books is almost imaginable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.429" offset="8242113">In Buckley the Court said that it might noted in passing that the defendant’s “expert witnesses” were for most part un-persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.317" offset="8281715">For example, a defense psychologist testified that 42nd Street Movies depicting sexual intercourse did not appeal to the prurient interest in sex, but that lingerie ads in the New York Times did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.039" offset="8344513">So, following the reasoning and going to the graphically obscene material, I think the Court said which then could not differ in their opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.491" offset="8414312">As are involved here, I don’t think that in this case expert opinion was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.659" offset="8447018">I don’t know how in the world one man is going to sit before a judge or a jury, or a combination of the two and tell them that they didn’t see on the screen what they just got to see and that’s exactly what he has to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.573" offset="8514727">I have tried one case that comes to mind where you cross examine these “expert witnesses” and the witness actually took to stand involving 16 magazines and never hesitated in his testimony for one moment while he was flipping through.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.354" offset="8589855">So he could testify that they were not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.954" offset="8608246">This is incredible, but this he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.635" offset="8622979">So we say that the procedural proposition is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.912" offset="8660072">The fourth question is the question the Court asked us to brief and to argue, whether a display of any sexually oriented films in the commercial theatre, when surrounded by a notice to the public of that nature and by reasonable protection against exposure of the films to juveniles is constitutionally protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.119" offset="8760905">I set out in my brief and I picked up here the commission report, the commission report don't like to use the word obscene and they had hogged the word pornographic, and they were the ones who first created in a Trial Court picked up, the use of the phrases explicit sexual material or sexually oriented materials, erotica, but they report in this preface on page three cautions that the word materials in this context, is meant to refer to the entire range of depictions or descriptions in both textural and pictorial form, primarily books, magazines, photographs, films, sound recording, statutory and sex devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.665" offset="8955047">Therefore, when faced with this question which relates to any sexual oriented materials, we must consider it to embrace all terms from cunnilingus with a female and a pig which is on the market to the Redrup inaculous materials, he expands the spectrum.</text>

            <text syncTime="2363.558" offset="9558580">I did not see see nor did the Supreme Court see where the word frolic came from.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.091" offset="9580732">After viewing the film, they held it to be hardcore pornography, I don’t think it’s in the question about it, and we ask this Court to go along.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.662" offset="9619080">We're in the fourth question, Mr. Justice and this is where we get into a very serious thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.490" offset="9654397">It was suggested for example in Mr. Fliesman's argument, that the right to sell a book is based upon the right of a person to read that book.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.901" offset="9723988">Now, Stanley limited itself and stated very clearly that nothing -- Roth is not impaired by what we hold here today, there’s no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.798" offset="9767560">It emphasizes that Roth was not impaired a second time and said it was not reversed and so did Reidel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.501" offset="9802355">But a number of the lower trial courts said, “That’s what the Supreme Court said, but that is not what they meant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.136" offset="9848957">And they extended Stanley to the right to possess, to the right to receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.202" offset="9873199">Any statute standing between that highway, was struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.063" offset="9892634">The right to receive was a right to transport.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.844" offset="9907785">So that statute went aside and to import, and that strike -- statute went aside in 37 books in the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.695" offset="9947178">And mind you again, the book is words created in the mind of an author and nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.995" offset="9992422">Perhaps they are more erotic, morphine, I don’t know, but that is important because motion picture films are live people and live animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.040" offset="10052608">Then take this extension if it can be so, that if you have a right to show sexually oriented films on an adult under controlled circumstances and hold that this is constitutionally protected, then someone has a right to sell these films to the distributor, which envisions the right to transport these films.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.544" offset="10166606">Which envisions the right to manufacture the film, and when the Court holds that a person has a constitutionally protected right, extending from a person who wants to view a film to manufacture films in the United States consisting of human being and animal, human beings and human beings, man and man, man and woman or combination of the two, then we’ve got a strange First Amendment, a very strange First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.892" offset="10304010">So you can't start extending unless you go all the way and this is a step in this Court to be taking and they don’t miss anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.324" offset="10349672">Now this question was decided I thought, frankly I thought that Reidel was a slight at the end of the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.791" offset="10387602">But Roth first held that is obscenity and this distribution was outside the reach of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.152" offset="10433055">In Reidel, on page 357, this Court observed that it is urged that there is a development sentiment that adult should have complete freedom to produce, to deal in, possess, and consume whatever commutative materials may appeal to them and that the law's involvement with obscenity should be limited to those situations where children are involved or where it is necessary to prevent imposition on unwilling recipients of whatever age.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.754" offset="10567429">The concepts involved are said to be so illusive that the laws so inherently unenforceable without extravagant expenditures of time and effort by enforcement officers, and that the Courts, the basement reassessment is not only wise, but essential and this is what this Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.943" offset="10652170">This may prove to be the desirable and eventual legislative course, but if it is, the task of restructuring the obscenity laws lies with those who pass, repeal, and amend statutes and ordinances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.577" offset="10710685">Roth and like cases pose no obstacle to such development, and this is where this question should lie, for it’s then in someway, some control could have to stop this line of communication along the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.525" offset="10786544">It is easy to look at one part of the question and say, “We can do this, and this is fine.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.545" offset="10818623">But you must look to the overall picture as to how it's going to affect everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.451" offset="10846208">And by proclaiming a constitutional privilege on one hand, may grant a constitutional license on another in a field that we did not even consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.285" offset="10909529">So we're getting now to as was urged in this Reidel to produce, to manufacture, to create and this would be indeed a tragic thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.411" offset="10973999">The same holding was held in Mugler versus Cane just back in 1887 and it’s been that way ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.365" offset="11013810">Now, they say but most of the people want to see this stuff, it's a multi-million dollar industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.804" offset="11059576">Gambling is a multi million dollar industry, prostitution is a multi million dollar industry, narcotics is a multi million dollar industry, and other heinous crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.044" offset="11092595">So the money value we're not concerned there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.265" offset="11105447">The fact that they are concerned about this lonely police officer, and poor District Attorney who has to prosecute these cases, doesn't appeal to me very favoredly, there is no valid reason for doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.516" offset="11154453">But they say that the Congressional Commission, the Presidential Commission of Obscenity, conclusively shows that people want to see all of this stuff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.145" offset="11224984">This Commission report was immediately rejected by the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.080" offset="11252673">It has no foundation in fact or in science.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.557" offset="11270646">It was referred in the Congress as a magna carta for pornographers, ludicrous, and a fraud among the American people and it was solemnly rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.710" offset="11319233">Now of all of the hired guns that they come down, that it first relied upon the commission report and now they have some other formula about telling you what the community standards are in Texas when they’ve never been South of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.636" offset="11390913">There is one survey upon which this commission primarily bases it’s report, that they don’t like to talk about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.050" offset="11428634">And even the most (Inaudible), and most saddled soul, hired gun, admits that the question is absolutely a fraud and unscientific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.413" offset="11485999">This was, the Abelson report and its contained in the Court there and the book says in the public opinion about sexually oriented materials, in 1970, a survey involving face to face interviews with a random sample of 2,486 adults and 769 young persons aged 15 to 20 was conducted at the Commission’s request Abelson et al. (1970).</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.209" offset="11629255">One of the purposes of the survey was to determine whether Americans regard and to find the area of erotic materials as a significant or important social problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.042" offset="11668543">Adults respondents were asked in the survey were asked this question and this is the deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.937" offset="11700099">Would you please tell me what you think are the two most serious problems facing the country today?</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.356" offset="11733849">And they set out what answers they gave, but only 2% mentioned erotic material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.854" offset="11759762">Therefore, 98% could not be concerned with it, but none of them mentioned cancer, tuberculosis, I guess nobody was concerned with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.739" offset="11803335">This negative report yet on the same page where this is contained, a report did candidly say this, “Opinion survey sometimes appear to report contradictory findings and the findings of the Commission study Abelson (1970), may appear to be inconsistent with reports that 85% of the American adults favor stricter laws on pornography, that's the Gallup opinion, and that 76% want pornographic literature outlawed and 72% believe smut is taking beauty out of sex” and how you can join those two or reconcile those two I will never know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.803" offset="12019628">The opinion though and this is my idea or understanding of this entire case is an effort to have this Court make the judgment of this Commission of obscenity and pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.937" offset="12080128">The judgment of this Court which would in effect repeal every law in obscenity in United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.785" offset="12107504">We say that this can be shown in commercial theatre, any material under controlled circumstances and every law relating to pornography throughout the state will be abolished except it applies to children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.907" offset="12164033">Perhaps, may it please the Court, that we’ve dealt too long in trying to define the word obscene or pornography and it's time we begin to describe the Act rather than to define the word, while it described it and said, “Certain things were hard core pornography.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.233" offset="12269359">Evanovich (ph) describe it and said, “This is hard core pornography,” but the judge also in there said, “Emphasized in such a way as to totally depersonalize the human model into an object or thing plainly design to make possible and this non cumulative kind of ultimately effect to these material.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.965" offset="12364236">We ask the Court to affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.912" offset="12372072">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3231.211" offset="13029209">The Abelson survey in the commission’s report on pornography and obscenity as found at page 43 of the Government Printing Office version clearly sets out a national survey of American public opinions sponsored by the Commission, shows that the majority of American adults believe that adult should be allowed to read or see any sexual materials they wish.</text>

            <text syncTime="3280.506" offset="13226381">And then they went on to ask the people whether or not they thought other should be allowed to see this as long as it did not intrude on to their privacy.</text>
