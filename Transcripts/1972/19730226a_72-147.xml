            <text syncTime="1.970" offset="111261">Mr. Jaworski, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Leon Jaworski</label>
            <text syncTime="7.089" offset="131741">Mr. Chief justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.712" offset="150235">As was true in the case argued just before, that's one the Attorney General of the Texas, the honorable John L. Hill has participated in the preparation of this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.797" offset="198510">He has the staff with us, and in order to avoid the providing of arguments, he has asked that I present the argument on behalf of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.185" offset="244067">I think it perhaps a more accurate description of what this case really involves could hardly be made and the characterization given it by the Central Judge who stated that this was an instance of the majority entering fields of the purely state and local management.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.538" offset="349497">Now under the provisions of Article 3, Section 28 of the Constitution of Texas, a Legislative Redistricting Board has assembled, if the legislature fails to redistrict the state after its first regular session following the publication of each United States decennial census.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.024" offset="463496">So the legislature convened in January 1971, was under constitutional mandate, to provide this redistricting.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.146" offset="508008">Our Texas has a bicameral legislature, and because the legislature had failed to redistrict in both houses, of course, any effort at redistricting failed and as a consequence, the redistricting board was assembled and considered the matter of providing a plan of redistricting the senate, and also a plan of redistricting the lower house.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.037" offset="627545">Now, this board consists as constituted by several elected officials, state officials serving on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.393" offset="672893">There is the Lieutenant Governor, the Speaker of the House, the Attorney General, the Comptroller of Public Accounts, and the Commissioner of the General Land Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.954" offset="719182">Now three or more of these members of the redistricting board may assign whatever plan they agree upon, and it certify to the Secretary of State, and then it becomes an effective plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.745" offset="794311">Now, I might say that the house plan is the only one.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.984" offset="811342">The plan relating to the representative is the only plan that's involved on this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.100" offset="843734">Perhaps, brief reference should be made to the commencement of those litigation after they planned to file, a suit was instituted in Houston, Texas by Curtis Graves, a black state representative from Harris County that?s Huston in which he contended that there was unconstitutional apportionment of the senatorial districts because of an alleged racial gerrymandering.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.684" offset="954075">His point being that there should have been district carved out in which 80% are blacks and that because one was not carved out in that matter that it was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.636" offset="1005902">And then next came, a number of others civil suits that were filled challenging the boards plan for the house of representatives in different parts of the state with different groups, filing these suits, and interventions were also filled on behalf of a number of groups and there was a consolidation of all of these actions and they were heard before the Three-Judge Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.438" offset="1117080">Now, the court ordered first that unless the legislature of Texas on or before July of the 1, 1973, adopted a plan to reapportion the legislative districts in accordance with the constitutional guideline set out in the court's opinion that the Court will then proceed to reapportion the state itself, and then the Court further ordered that the counties of Dallas, that is where the city of Dallas is and the County of Bexar that's where San Antonio is that both of these, the reapportioned into single-member representative districts in conformance with a plan of reapportionment that the court provided.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="301.294" offset="1308505">Mr. Jaworski, was there injunctive relief granted?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leon_jaworski" startTime="304.086" stopTime="387.605">
            <label>Mr. Leon Jaworski</label>
            <text syncTime="304.086" offset="1319685">Yes sir, an injunctive relief, excuse me sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.167" offset="1340061">The injunctive relief consisted all of the state being restrained from proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.413" offset="1361063">The elections could not be held in accordance with the plan that had been filed by the redistricting Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.991" offset="1403382">A judge would say, state it very frankly that he'll wholeheartedly disagree with his colleagues in declaring the state plan unconstitutional, saying that he could think of nothing that illustrated more vividly the chaos that existed in the area of restructuring the political districts of a state as was attempted to be done and ordered by the court in this particular instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.997" offset="1503378">It'd be done by July 1, 1973 or else of course the plan had to be adopted. Of course the Mahan versus Howell case is very significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.345" offset="1556773">A number of the courts' pronouncements in that case are quite applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.239" offset="1576312">Perhaps I should point out that what the majority did in our case was relied on the Kirkpatrick versus Preisler case and repeatedly refrying to it also on Wells versus Rockefeller, both which is we know are congressional redistricting cases.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="387.605" stopTime="398.944">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="387.605" offset="1653844">Mr. Jaworski, has the court has said at least once and perhaps more often that a good deal more flexibility is permitted in state legislature then in congressional districts?</text>

          <turn speaker="leon_jaworski" startTime="398.944" stopTime="403.805">

            <text syncTime="398.944" offset="1699192">That's what this Court of course said in the Mahan and Howell case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leon Jaworski</label>
            <text syncTime="408.991" offset="1739316">Right sir, but it was quite well emphasized in a case that was decided or relevant in [Voice Overlap]</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="414.647" stopTime="418.451">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="414.647" offset="1761991">So that there was nothing new in Mahan against Howell in that respect?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leon_jaworski" startTime="418.451" stopTime="1307.462">
            <label>Mr. Leon Jaworski</label>
            <text syncTime="418.451" offset="1777142">No, I do not think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.781" offset="1786546">I think it did some reemphasizing and perhaps having come so recently or something that we might talk about little more, but let me just pass counsel, but certainly there was nothing new in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.136" offset="1839940">The interesting thing is that Judge Wood who so strongly dissented in this case from the actual majority, recognized that difference in his dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.833" offset="1882676">And he recognized the difference between congressional districts and legislative districts, pointing to the cases, pointing to Reynolds versus Sims.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.739" offset="1942340">Now what the majority did here was required, first a much stricter standard of state legislative reapportionment, permissible deviation and had been approved theretofore.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.741" offset="1990301">Actually in this case the total variation of 9.9% under the board was on question thus far as the majority opinion was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.991" offset="2051323">I notice wherein in one of the briefs some question was raised whether that might be entirely accurate, but there had been nothing before the lower court raised any question beyond that of it being assumed and considered that the total variation was only 9.9%.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.067" offset="2131675">Now, this was under the board's redistricting plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.155" offset="2159992">I should point out that actually the average variation was only 1.82%.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.186" offset="2216103">Now one of the problems in this case, a matter on which so very much stress was laid by majority the court which in our view led the court exactly to nothing as far as the end result was concerned, where the procedural (Inaudible) is simply followed by this board.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.610" offset="2297814">There were several tings that took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.269" offset="2304397">Of course these men, all of them had to depend upon staff assistance because they had other duties to perform as state officials and they did have considerable staff assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.648" offset="2345984">Perhaps the one official who participated more than any one else in this particular matter was the Attorney General himself who counseled with the redistricting board constantly on what should be done and also letting him know on the what was permissibly legal as he interpreted the decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.387" offset="2440965">But the Court has gone to considerable extent in talking about, not the end results so much as these procedures that was employed in finding fault with them, and finding fault with the particular assistance that had been rendered by members of the staff and such as that forgetting it seems to me at least for a moment that even judges need the assistance or at least utilize the assistance of law clerks at times.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.717" offset="2558203">But, also it is very clear, there was a complete misapprehension of Whitcomb versus Chavis actually said.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.309" offset="2604596">What the Court here did was not only indicated, went into the matter of redistricting the entire state also found fault with what had been specifically insofar as single and multi-member districts were concerned and the two counties that I mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.788" offset="2686516">What the court failed to do as we see it was to employ the equal protection test and that a state must make an honest and a good-faith effort to construct the districts as nearly of equal population as is practicable and there is nothing here to indicate in this record that this good-faith effort was not made.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.474" offset="2793305">And let me regress for a moment if I may, because I have noted that there were some references made in some of the briefs to some alleged evidence in this case that frankly is no evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.132" offset="2851924">What happened at the outset was that the Chief Judge of this Three-Judge Court, the presiding judge and announced that everything that was offered by anyone would be admitted in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.461" offset="2901243">He didn't want us to even make any objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.572" offset="2917648">If the matter was conjectural, if it was hearsay or whatever the proper objection may have been it went into the record anyway and the announcement being that the court would at the end consider those things that were admissible on those matters that were not admissible, but there were no rulings ever made by the court and as a consequence the floodgates were opened and everybody led into thinking that you want to bring before the court just introduced it into evidence and then proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.229" offset="3036244">We don't know actually what the court did consider and what it didn't consider speaking of the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.676" offset="3058082">But, we do know that there were some matters tendered here that were not admissible in evidence and that the record presently is cluttered with some of those matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.942" offset="3099146">I mention that simply because what should really be a relatively a easy case to discuss with the court and the issues being well defined as we see it, is complicated a little because of some of the references that have been made in some of the briefs to what the evidence purportedly showed.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.552" offset="3177618">Now, the court, the majority, apparently everywhere just placed the burden upon the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.054" offset="3219623">It may, you know to show that there was no inequality of any kind, that there was no discrimination of any kind, that there wasn't any type of dilution and had us carry the burden throughout the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.833" offset="3310738">So, far as I tell we discharged the burden although it is questionable as to whether we had the burden in all of these instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.198" offset="3344175">Now Texas is a large state as is known, we will not engage in talking about how large it is, but it's not only a large one, but it is also has a shape and it does not render it very easily susceptible to a division among districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.069" offset="3419617">So, some problem is going to be encountered, but we actually -- what was necessary here were -- well, let me say first the ideal district was about 74,000, seventy four thousand plus.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.353" offset="3480743">There were a 150 representatives to be elected to the lower house and a large number of districts had to be carved out in addition to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.801" offset="3522539">This particular board was confronted with a decision -- first with the provision of the Constitution of our state which had been interpreted in the case of Craddick versus Smith which we cite in our brief and under that county lines could not be crossed, unless it were absolutely necessary to do it in order to make up this district of 74,000, the ideal.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.879" offset="3638836">It also required that it go to a contagious county if it were necessary to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.265" offset="3664436">Now, Texas as we know and as the Court doubtless knows, not only has this large metropolitan cities, but it has rural areas that has large areas that are very sparsely settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.771" offset="3710412">Now actually there was no instance in which our constitutional requirements and the integrity that was required for this board to follow was not carefully embraced in each instance with the possible exception, well would be exception of Red River County and there we had a real problem up in the part that adjoins Arkansas with the Red River and between the two of them had a problem as to Buren County.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.008" offset="3823365">So, what was actually done is that in that one instance the county line, it was crossed.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.808" offset="3858578">Now, the total population incidentally as the Court probably has already gathered from what I had said is according to the last census about eleven million two hundred thousand.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.426" offset="3917093">The senatorial district is not involved here, but maybe of interest of the Court is of approximately 360,000 to 368,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.005" offset="3975398">Now, if we were to draw comparisons here and I do this only because a case has just been decided by this Court and to show a similarity of the situations if I may reveal those in the Virginia, there was a total variation of 16.4 under what the board that here, the total variation of 9.9 and average variation in the Mahan case of 3.89 in Texas of 1.82.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.679" offset="4106115">Within the 4% there were 35 of the districts in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.573" offset="4133700">In Texas we had 93 under this Board's plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.440" offset="4149164">Those that exceeded 6% were 9 In Virginia, there were none under this Board's plan in Texas and only two exceeded the 5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.273" offset="4208515">I indicated a few moments ago that it was our view that what Whitcomb v. Chavis had been misinterpreted and we do feel that that is definitely in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.615" offset="4257834">I want to mention one effort that was made in particular, that was injunction in the case the fact that perhaps one difference was that in Indiana particular the Marion County which was involved in the Whitcomb v. Chavis case that there was no racial history and a suggestion was made the Texas had a racial history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.707" offset="4362219">Here is no one that would deny that Texas has true what so many of the states has a racial legacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.805" offset="4390640">It is untrue that there is any showing whatever that there has been any such happenings, any sort of racial violation with respect to the electoral process in our state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.069" offset="4451662">The last one according to testimony in this case undisputed is coming from a witness who appeared on behalf of the appellees was back in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.807" offset="4502549">So that this is really not in the case despite the fact the witness was put on the stand to testify that or undertake to testify and this is one of the particular matters to which I refer that has made it somewhat difficult to briefly argue this case because the court admitted everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.939" offset="4579140">Man who opposed does an expert and undertook to say that there was a difference as far as racial history in Indianapolis and Marion County was concerned and in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.939" offset="4627101">And then it turned out when I asked them the question on cross examination that he had never even been to Indiana much less Indianapolis had not made any type of study of the matter and as I said in our brief to show what we had to contend with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.512" offset="4701393">I should say that there is a stipulation in the record in order to lay at rest completely the matter of all having been free to engage in our process of registration as well as holding, there is a stipulation that there has been and none of that in our state for a number of years and of course the evidence shows nothing of the kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.736" offset="4802330">Now, we get into another phase that I want to discuss with the court if I may and that has what happened with respect to Harris County, Houston under the boards plan being divided into single member districts and what happened and so far as Dallas -- it is Dallas County and San Antonio Bear County being multimember districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.950" offset="4923120">Now there of course is some difference one could say Huston a very large city, a million seven hundred thousand either fifth or sixth largest city of the nation at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.490" offset="4981321">Dallas, a million three, Dallas county.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.054" offset="5003577">San Antonio, even a much smaller city than that, traditionally Dallas had multi member districts same was true of Bexar County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.578" offset="5053733">And as far as Huston is concerned Harris county the legislators themselves, the delegation from their more or less favored single member districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.352" offset="5100753">So on the surface you might say why does the Harris County have single member districts and why does Dallas and Bexar County have multiple member districts?</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.734" offset="5138265">Really it was done without to being the slightest intimation on the record that in the individual group sacrificed any constitutional rights by virtue of it, it was done largely because the board had before it witnesses who thought that this was a sensible thing to do in Harris County had witnesses before that thought it was a sensible thing to do in Dallas and Bexar County what was done in those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.839" offset="5246725">Now our position is they tops in, the showing of something that shows that either voting strength is being diluted or that something has been done that has occasioned the transpiration of a constitutional right that certainly much has been made of nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1475.114" offset="6003858">Here the record shows that they were contemplating three blacks on their slate following this active redistricting, actually that they have had at different levels are just even include in the legislative level black on the slate before, that is true that it is as strong political organization it is true that a black placed on that slate probably would be elected is also true when a white placed on that slate would be elected.</text>

            <text syncTime="1590.024" offset="6463509">We -- let me open with the brief luminary we are dividing our 45 minutes between three counsel, I would attempt to open to discuss the what we consider to be the underlying irrationality of the state plan and the dilution of the Negroes voter vote in Dallas County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.881" offset="6542921">Mr. Idar will follow discussing the underlying distinctions we think on this record between Whitcomb v. Chavis and the impact of the at-large scheme on the Mexican American minority of Bexar County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.485" offset="6593285">Mr. Gee on behalf of State Republican party will follow to discuss what everything we forget including jurisdiction and I think the inordinate costs of election campaigns in the County which would suggestive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.008" offset="6647411">As a preliminary matter the order below is a first, it?s a complicated four part, four law suits consolidating with various contentions I guess the order below is of two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.794" offset="6694536">There is a declaratory judgment which does feed to the statewide apportionment plan but that was not effectuated by injunction but rather it was left to be operative only in July of this year and the event the legislature did not address themselves to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.541" offset="6749497">There was injunctive relief it was narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.093" offset="6759737">It effected only two Counties and the state of Texas those Counties of Dallas and Bexar their single member district plans were implemented by the court unanimously Judge Wood who have did descent from the other portions for the court's opinion below agreed that this was so egregious in Dallas and Bexar County that implementation of immediate single member districts was in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.036" offset="6847509">So we think the jurisdictional issue is in the case Mr. Gee will address himself to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.443" offset="6889096">The route problem that confronted the Texas legislature when it or readily redistricting board when it began to consider the reapportionment to the Texas legislature was what to do with the urban counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.561" offset="6941654">The testimony is clear that this was in words of one witness enraging controversy across state of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.352" offset="6968822">Hearings were held by the legislative redistricting board on two occasions concerning what was to be done all of the witnesses who appeared were concerned only with this single issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.908" offset="7006960">Urban counties of Dallas, Bexar and Harris whether to be divided into individual districts or something last then at large are worthy to left at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.950" offset="7047189">Now the board and what is remains and orderly unarticulated decisions decided to divide Harris county in the 23 individual member districts and to leave and Dallas and Bexar county running at large Dallas has become what we all saying recognized to be the largest legislative districts in the nations history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.192" offset="7136110">18 legislators elected from at-large of one million four hundred thousand people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.892" offset="7158888">No requirement of geographic distribution they could all come from one city block with in the city of Dallas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.531" offset="7181458">Now the peculiarity here quite granted there was a history of at-large representation in the urban cities of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.273" offset="7212492">It was true of all the cities of Texas until 1965 when the Texas legislature did for the first time a portion Harris County, Huston into something less than the County wide districts at that time in Kilgarlin V. Martin the State of Texas explained to the Federal Courts that a policy existed and that policy was at anytime a County became a one million in size, or more than 15 legislators, it became simply unworkable to run at-large and that in the future, then anytime a county became that size, that county itself would be a portion down in something less than at-large representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.999" offset="7379362">Well, then Dallas County hit a million for this year, larger than Harris was an 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.271" offset="7400469">That policy went by the board without even whisper on the part of the board members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.090" offset="7427741">Of this Legislative Redistricting Board, three of them had been defendants in the Kilgarlin case who presumably had the sparse of that explanation for the -- at that time for the apportionment of Harris County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.859" offset="7470791">At no time, although now in their reply brief, the court -- the appellant say that that really never was a policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.022" offset="7499421">They certainly never told the court that, the court's opinion it was a policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.818" offset="7514676">When the appeal papers were filed here, there's no indication of any disclaimer of that policy when the Kilgarlin v. Martin was considered here as Kilgarlin v. Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.087" offset="7559711">The only reason that appears ever for this rather curious treatment of the two counties was in the jurisdictional statement filed by the appellants and they suggested there that the reason they left Dallas County at-large was the dominant democratic organization Dallas County preferred to take when they will take all election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.950" offset="7635153">They have not sponsored that as their reason in their subsequent briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.012" offset="7655424">We talked about the board procedures in our briefs and we did deal with it, not because we want to go behind the board or not because they want to indite what they did because they did it on a sloppy manner but because it points to no rational state policy that underlies this very crucial decision in terms of how people are going to be elected in a county, the size of Dallas. 500,000 registered voters in that county to which any person who seeks to be elected to the legislature must somehow communicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.432" offset="7781125">The last general primary election in Dallas had 68 races on it, 3+ congressional seats, 3+ state senate seats and a submerged 15 member legislative delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.330" offset="7832743">Results of this rather whims or goal if you will, if not penal decision with respect to Dallas of course is to isolate the black minority of that city which has suffered a traditional isolation that this record speaks to quite strongly and just simply and intolerable bind, there is no relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.097" offset="7915708">Texas remains a one-party state, this is not a situation such as Indiana in which conceivably the explanation for the under-representation of the ghetto was winning and losing elections in November.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.505" offset="7965341">What happens in Texas is, you win or lose in a Democratic Primary, the Democratic Primary is a majority place system that means and order to obtain the nomination, you must -- if you are a black candidate, ultimately be pitted vis-a-v a white candidate, in a county in which racial segregation, discrimination has still been the order of the day, granted it diminishes, but as this record establishes, it diminishes rather slowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.970" offset="8079235">What this record further shows is that the dominant political organization of that county, the DCRG, when circumstances require and their candidates are threatened by a black candidate or by a candidate that has the support of the Negro minority, they simply try out the old game of race in order to win.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.128" offset="8183933">In 1970, two candidates made it into the run-off, Democratic Primary run-off against the DCRG candidates, the DCRG being a private sort of modern day chambered association, of course we are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.666" offset="8250075">In that run-off, the DCRG mailed to some -- the white voters of Dallas County, literature saying ?Black voting tactics will take place in the South Dallas, the Negro area of Dallas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.713" offset="8314232">If you don't get out to propose him vote,? and it said the philosophy of these candidates is best described by being close.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.906" offset="8342967">One of the candidates was white, in the previous year, he had sent out a mailing for a biracial voter registration activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.379" offset="8372851">It was this philosophy that the DCRG, which runs Dallas County politics concluded, was the most effective way to appeal to the voters of Dallas County and it was quite effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.748" offset="8414333">The other two they used, they simply used a picture of the black candidate, contrasted with his white opponent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.702" offset="8438157">It was quite effective as I say in the black precinct of Dallas, these candidates, white and black got 90% and 87% of the vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.626" offset="8481834">They were obliterated in the white precincts and were defeated very sizably.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.035" offset="8499493">Now, that's the reality, the political reality this record establishes, as we say if the black minority of Dallas County establishes -- it fostered as we see it by other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.293" offset="8572531">The massive size of the legislative district is such, there is simply no way that a candidate can address himself to that electoral without enormous finance, the record rangers estimates to run a state legislative rates from anywhere from $60,000 to a $125,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.655" offset="8649958">This means that only if a candidate has that kind of finance, could he ever even expect to receive individualized consideration in the rate as a legislative candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.210" offset="8692172">The affect of it has been to really prevent the emergence of a two-party system in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.889" offset="8714951">The record, although it maybe a little shocking, but that's what the record is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.045" offset="8727594">But the Republican Party in Dallas has been unable and unwilling to mount serious legislative races in November, simply because the financing is beyond their means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.009" offset="8775450">So, what we have is again, a one-party system, terminations being made in the Democratic Primary and a majority place system and a primary that continues to be dominated by a white alagarky that has not permitted black participation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2794.845" offset="11282787">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.602" offset="11293759">Pursuing the matter that has just been raised I think that for our part we would like to stress that we conceive the right to vote has going far beyond nearly casting a ballot, marking it in custom and this court has so held and our position here primarily as to Bexar County is that because of certain statutes in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.074" offset="11395636">Our minority in Bexar County has been totally submerged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.536" offset="11413504">Now, I would like to point out that the lower court found that race is still an important in Bexar County and because of it Mexican Americans were frozen into permanent political minorities destined for constant defeat of the hands of the controlling political majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.747" offset="11490408">Now, I will emphasize that this is a finding made by three judges who have spent their entire life in Texas, one of them being Judge Wood from San Antonio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.540" offset="11533563">Now, I would like to stress on the multimember district issue that as far as a Legislative Redistricting Board where he initiated his work on the House Redistricting Plan, it expressly had before it certain cautionary language on the part of the Texas Supreme Court in the case of Mauzy v.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.688" offset="11634082">The Legislative Redistricting Board which is the one mandamus the board to redistrict the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.454" offset="11661145">The Texas Supreme Court who presumably is familiar with the democracy of our state, of our municipalities, our metropolitan areas of the distribution and concentration of the minority groups expressly stated as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.189" offset="11716106">In exercising its discretions as to whether to create multimember districts within a single county, we must assume that the board will give careful consideration to the question of whether or not the creation of any particular multimember district would result in discrimination by minimizing the voting strength of any political or racial elements of the voting population.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.249" offset="11816417">Now, I would like to point out to this court that it is on the record that from 1880 to 1970, there were only five Mexican Americans have been elected to the Texas house, one of them in 1890, four of them since 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.089" offset="11903770">I would further stress that between 1960 and 1970 and this is part of the record and it is un-controverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.680" offset="11962075">Out of a 133 races in the Democratic Party primaries, only 22 were entered by Mexican Americans and of course as I already have stated, only four were actually elected during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.811" offset="12010663">Now, from the particular area where the Mexican Americans concentrated in San Antonio, which is on the record as 28 contiguous census track area, only four candidates win from that area between 1960 and 1970, two Mexican Americans, one Negro, one Anglo-American.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.453" offset="12093210">Now, I can not overstress what Mr. Richards touched upon and that is the size of the multimember districts that we are dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.555" offset="12149635">Bexar County 830000 and 460000 population the city of San Antonio 654000 is larger than seventeen of it a 132 countries in the United Nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.737" offset="12206268">It is larger than the combine population of four of those countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.569" offset="12225599">It is larger than 11 states but elect 22 United States senators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.904" offset="12247019">It has an land area larger than the state of Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.810" offset="12262588">Now 1246 squared miles, it is larger both in land area and population than the State of Columbia.</text>

            <text syncTime="3073.287" offset="12396544">I think we have to ? that?s where the racial history of our state counseling to play Your Honor and I would like to stress up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.681" offset="12438131">Since 1966 through 1972 we have had 6 Federal Court decisions dealing with the political, with the electoral system in Texas, five of those between 1970 and 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.250" offset="12500407">The poll tax was set aside in 1966 the excessive filing fee requirement in 1970, the six months residency requirement 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.001" offset="12543352">The over increased cities and small town in South Texas and local city charter provision requiring property ownership for election to city office was set aside by a single judge or District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.018" offset="12599463">In the case Archer V. Smith in 1971 the certain provisions in the Texas electoral court denying the right to illiterate voters to have an election judge help to mark the ballot was set aside on the grounds that that seem right was not denied to blind or physically disable olds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.902" offset="12675009">Now when I touch upon a literacy in that case, I must point out that persons may be illiterate in English or not necessarily illiterate persons because they do speak and read Spanish and they do follow Spanish radio and television and they do have the means at hand to form political judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.308" offset="12760586">We have had in addition to that, since 1971 three decisions having to do with Jury service, the denial of opportunity to serve on juries and we have seeks decisions is 1970 dealing with education, one of them is now before this court which is one involving the Rodriguez case in the Independent School District in San Antonio on school finance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.867" offset="12858807">So, in reply to that question why don't we vote, we need to assess a situation of the Mexican American actually has developed in the history of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.330" offset="12908648">A slate 1972 we cannot wipe all of this hindrances and then overnight inspect the injured group to be able to compete on an equal fooding with those people who have never been hindered and when you throw them into the type of multimember district county that we have where they have to compete in an area of over a thousand square miles or they have to appeal to an electoral that is close to a million voter where they have to raise a finances and I am not minimizing the fact that the record in our brief make some profuse references to economic, educational, in any number 4 to 5, that has be adverse to the Mexican American population.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.547" offset="13105612">We cannot equate numbers simply with the denial of right. I think in minority constitutionally those have define purely on the basis of numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.892" offset="13166947">So my position is, our position is that because of these hindrances true, we don't hold to the extent that other people (Inaudible) also incidentally I forgot to mention that I know the part of the record is that the Anglo American population in Bexar County we vote on a ration of 6:1 to 9:1 against Mexican American candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.226" offset="13272273">I might further pointing out that I said result for the single member district that were in post on the Counties where order for the county by the Trail Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="4409.090" offset="17739734">Further Texas, now unlike Virginia as I indicated by the courts opinion has not consistently fallowed the state policy of respecting county line.</text>

Craddick the Texas Supreme Court felt them strain to invalidate a legislature plan enacted by the Texas legislature or which disregard county and it has not, may it please the court done so in this case where 19 counties are could, I am confused by the reoccurring statement that only one county is divided.</text>

            <text syncTime="4495.167" offset="18084028">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4497.443" offset="18093119">On the jurisdictional question I think it perhaps the questions that have been asked by a members of the court who have brought out the basis on which we argued the matter of jurisdiction and I would merely say to the court that we have cited in our brief that the cases that are applicable, we also have undertaken to show to the court that the cases on which the appellees rely are not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4529.413" offset="18221014">Actually, what has been done here has a state wide impact.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="4532.787" offset="18234493">Does the state take the appeal from the Court of Appeals?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leon_jaworski" startTime="4538.131" stopTime="4853.389">
            <label>Mr. Leon Jaworski</label>
            <text syncTime="4538.131" offset="18255914">No sir, no sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="4540.663" offset="18266049">What happened was that a part of the appeal, you may recall, this court entered a judgment, the appeal that came from Harris County and they remembered that the court entered a judgment dismissing that part, not for lack of jurisdiction but for other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4559.073" offset="18339715">In any event, this has been fully briefed, I don?t think that I need to take the time of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4564.184" offset="18360090">Actually, I did not see because the rule first that this actually had a state wide impact but secondly, also the pendant jurisdiction rule; I had not taken the time to really argue that for the court and the original argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.215" offset="18412231">Now, passing on to something else and Mr. Justice Stewart did ask me about the history with respect to Harris County and it was that history with respect to Houston, Harris County that I undertook to say I was not fully familiar with.</text>
            <text syncTime="4594.722" offset="18482239">The history as to Dallas County has been one consistently of multimember districts but as far Harris County is concerned, I answer that they were floterial districts in 1965; there were three multimember districts in 1966, five multimember districts in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="4615.935" offset="18567084">Now, this is the history as the record shows it to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4619.544" offset="18581504">I merely pointed out because Harris County did have some history of some multimember districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4626.715" offset="18610239">But it also has a history that really shows more that there has been a division and when we speak of polls, for instance, in Dallas County in connection with the matter of polls, I think we get into some difficulty because the polls as we know, if they are going to be polls relate to how well a candidate is running, they may have some inaccuracy but I wasn?t referring to polls, I was referring to what had actually been requested to all of the representatives of the people and the record shows this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4661.407" offset="18749001">The legislators had been known the wishes with respect to what they wanted in Harris County and also what the situation was as desired in the other counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4673.829" offset="18798738">Now, with respect to the matter of policy, actually I don?t know where the idea got into the record that there had been any state policy with respect to the matter, Mr. Justice Stewart, that was raised a question you referred to where 15 district matters arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4697.358" offset="18892779">What actually happened was that the limitation was never offered in a state policy at one time, the House committee on congressional and legislative districts had felt that multimember district should be somewhat limited in size because of the voting machine problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4714.715" offset="18962265">Now these changes in the voting machines and the difficulty of getting them and the difficulty of their cost and placing so many of them did raise a question but this was largely done to accommodate a new change that had been made in the voting machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="4731.771" offset="19030497">The limitation was never offered as a state policy as this record will show and there is no indication as I read the Kilgarlin case that the court assured or was assured that the limitation would be continued in future apportionment plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="4749.145" offset="19099982">This is just simply something that we find unable to follow completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="4755.422" offset="19125060">Then when we speak of single-member and multimember districts or single-member districts throughout the state, there?s an interesting Texas Supreme Court case which we have referred to in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4772.094" offset="19191724">It?s the Mauzy case as we also referred to it and they are in the Texas Supreme Court refuge to grant the relator?s request that the board be ordered to use single-member districts throughout the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.587" offset="19237700">And you?ll also find in the Smith versus Craddick case decided by the Supreme Court of Texas that there is absolutely nothing found, and this is the Texas Supreme Court talking about multimember districts itself as they found that in any part of the state, there was an unfairness with respect to the matter of multimember districts, I think they would have said so. Consistently, there has been nothing along that line intimated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4813.373" offset="19356818">Now, on Bexar County I just want to again say this, may it please the court that what the court said in effect of the trial court is we are condemning it not because it operated to dilute or cancel the votes cast by the Mexicans-Americans which I think is the test that we all want to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.628" offset="19429857">Here what the court said in effect is we believe that this way, in the hypothesis and the reasoning of the court applied, we believe this will encourage more Mexican-Americans to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4843.438" offset="19477086">Well, of course, we cannot accept this in the test as a fact theory and then determining the constitutional issues that are before the court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4852.965" offset="19515225">Yes sir.</text>

            <text syncTime="4867.564" offset="19573635">If I saw anything in the record at all, anything that showed that it was done as a result of doing more than just seeking to comply, with what the legislators had said they thought was appropriate in those districts, then I would have some trouble with it too.</text>
            <text syncTime="4885.119" offset="19643852">But I find nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="4895.697" offset="19686170">I mean except, unless you get on some very (Inaudible) some very great refinements which very frankly I would not even suggest although you do have a difference in size.</text>
            <text syncTime="4905.582" offset="19725667">You do have some difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.003" offset="19735385">You would find it perhaps more acceptable in Houston than you would in Dallas County.</text>
            <text syncTime="4913.334" offset="19756701">There is a considerable difference in the size of the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="4916.029" offset="19767463">There is a considerable difference in the way the two metropolitan areas actually lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="4920.391" offset="19784913">One is much more compact than the other one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4922.422" offset="19793063">But all I just have to frankly say that if there were anything here that suggested that it had been done for the purpose of diluting or canceling strength of any group, I would immediately say that there was a serious question with respect to it but you just will not find that in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4941.858" offset="19870804">This is why I say that there is nothing, absent something that cast down upon it or that shows that it was done for some ulterior purpose or that there is some lack of good faith involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4953.945" offset="19919182">I would say that there is nothing to keep state from having both multimember and single-member districts and some of its localities.</text>
