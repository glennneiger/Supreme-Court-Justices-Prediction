            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="104.824" offset="522637">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.400" offset="536952">This is a group of four related cases all here on writs of certiorari to review the same decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.522" offset="597452">The questions arise out of two proceedings commenced by a separate letter of communications to the Federal Communications Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.256" offset="640397">The first letter of complaint was sent to the Commission on January 22, 1970 by an organization known as Business Executives' Move for Vietnam Peace customarily called BEM in these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.605" offset="717824">Now, this complaint appears at page 291 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.782" offset="738513">BEM sought an order from the Communications Commission to compel Washington Radio Station WTOP to run spot announcements against the Vietnam War either free of charge or for a fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.428" offset="809044">Although BEM's specific complaint related to advertising time, its arguments were not confined to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.746" offset="842376">The substance of the complaint appears near the end at page 296 of the appendix and I will read the first full paragraph at the top of page 296.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.871" offset="898905">“For the reasons stated above, the business executive move for Vietnam Peace request that the Federal Communications Commission ordered WTOP to broadcast free of charge BEM's one minute announcements or in the alternative that the Commission required WTOP to sell BEM airtime for broadcasting of these announcements.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.288" offset="1016560">The respondent in that matter Post-Newsweek Stations replied to the complaint by a letter and there were further filings by letter which appears in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.106" offset="1067760">There was no hearing or any submission of evidence or arguments other than these letters.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.875" offset="1102869">The other proceeding before the Commission began on May 19, 1970 when the Democratic National Committee wrote to the Commission requesting a declaratory ruling which would allow it to buy time in order to comment on public issues and solicit funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.651" offset="1181968">This letter begins on page 15 of the appendix and the essence of it is on the opening page of page 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.263" offset="1224391">And there, the Democratic National Committee requested the Commission to issue a declaratory ruling that under the First Amendment of the Constitution and the Communications Act, a broadcaster may not as a general policy refuse to sell time to responsible entities such as the DNC for the solicitation of funds and for comment on public issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.945" offset="1339120">DNC indicated that it wanted the time for the broadcaster's specific programs of varying durations and for spot announcements of varying durations.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.356" offset="1384782">DNC said that the primary reason for wanting this time was at it was in debt and it needed the money that television solicitation could bring in.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.208" offset="1424175">It did not limit its claim to advertising time.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.067" offset="1439640">It relied on the First Amendment but it recognize that even under the -- its First Amendment claims that broadcasters could limit the use of their facilities to, and I quote their words, “responsible spokesman” and it recognize that broadcasters could adopt procedures to ensure that the presentation was in good taste.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.727" offset="1546324">The Commission asked for comments from the three broadcasting networks.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.129" offset="1567848">The National Broadcasting Company responded that it had no policy against selling time to a political party and that it would permit solicitation of funds on such a program.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.369" offset="1616854">It added that it had offered to sell time to DNC but was advised that the Committee did not wish to proceed with the purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.227" offset="1660322">Both the American Broadcasting Companies and the Columbia Broadcasting System responded saying in substance that they were bound to comply with the Fairness Doctrine established by the Commission and upheld by this Court in the Red Lion case in 395 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.791" offset="1738585">But that it was their policy not to accept sponsored discussions of political or controversial issues or to allow solicitation funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.552" offset="1781530">The position of CBS may be summarized by referring to page 51 of the appendix, about two inches from the top of the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.830" offset="1826670">In adopting this policy we concluded that we could not provide coverage of significant issues with fairness and balance if partisans with strong financial resources could preempt our facilities to present their viewpoints on issues they select.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.722" offset="1894275">A policy of selling time to partisans within our view necessarily distort the matter in which issues were presented to the listening and viewing public.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.357" offset="1932831">CBS has concluded that as a licensee and a medium with a finite amount of time to provide news, information and entertainment, we best serve the public by presenting issues and view points within a balance programed schedule utilizing news worthiness as a sole criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.198" offset="2020185">On August 5, 1970 the Commission denied BEM's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.138" offset="2047875">Commissioner Cox made a concurring statement and Commissioner Johnson dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.395" offset="2076923">A week later on August 12th, the Commission issued a memorandum opinion and order denying the request of DNC for a declaratory ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.346" offset="2120808">Again, Commissioner Cox concurred and Commissioner Johnson dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.269" offset="2148498">The Commission in its opinions did not really focus on advertising time except in response to Commissioner Johnson's dissent in the DNC case.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.058" offset="2195623">And even there, the Commission appears to be talking about both programming and advertising time similarly in the BEM opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.402" offset="2237001">The Commission does not highlight advertising time though that was all that was involved in BEM's complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.169" offset="2280051">Now, following these decisions, BEM and DNC filed separate appeals in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.782" offset="2314533">The Federal Communications Commission and the United States were the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.891" offset="2338983">And the two cases were consolidated there, Post-Newsweek Stations, American Broadcasting Companies, and Columbia Broadcasting System intervened.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.992" offset="2395303">The Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the Commission in an opinion by Judge Wright concurred in by Judge Robinson and Judge McGowan filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.862" offset="2446817">The four cases now here were filed to review this decision according to the varying and risk of the seven parties involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.050" offset="2487568">A Post-Newsweek Stations filed a petition with BEM as respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.910" offset="2510973">Columbia Broadcasting System and American Broadcasting Companies filed a petition, separate petitions with DNC as respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.386" offset="2552874">And the United States and the Federal Communications Commission filed petitions against both complainants, BEM and DNC.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.606" offset="2601775">In many respects, the positions of the United States and the Commission on the one hand are similar to those of the broadcasters, on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.283" offset="2648482">In particular, speaking for the Commission and the United States, however, I should point out this possible difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.659" offset="2682023">In particular, I am interested in maintaining the preposition that this is an area in which the Commission is properly concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.118" offset="2719848">And were it has authority to act, if it should determine that affirmative action on its part is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.968" offset="2755271">I should let the broadcaster speak for themselves, but they would, I gather from their briefs, preferred to have it establish that the Commission cannot act at all in this area consistently with their First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.649" offset="2817964">These differences does not seem to me to be essential in the present case, as long as it can be determined that the Commission acted properly when it decided not to act in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.713" offset="2886196">Now, there's one more factual situation which I should put before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.130" offset="2911901">While this case was pending before the Court of Appeals on June 19, 1971, the Commission published a notice in the Federal Register initiating a broad study into the efficacy of the Fairness Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.744" offset="2978356">The Commissions specifically under took the study, “In the light of current demands for access to the broadcast media to consider issues of public concern.”</text>
            <text syncTime="732.781" offset="3034467">The Commission noted, however, that it could not abandon the Fairness Doctrine since that is ratified by Act of Congress or treat broadcasters as common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.734" offset="3086294">What the Commission said -- sought it said, “Was whether the policies it had developed are the most effective means of fostering uninhibited robust wide open debate on public issues.”</text>
            <text syncTime="763.563" offset="3157661">When, in January and February of this year there was a period when the mandate of the Court of Appeals in this case was not stayed, the Commission published a further notice soliciting comments on the procedures and guidelines necessary to carry out the mandate of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.331" offset="3244701">This letter notice was withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.312" offset="3256613">When this Court granted the certiorari and stayed the mandate of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.767" offset="3282422">But the Commission has continued its overall inquiry into the Fairness Doctrine and its operation, and has requested comments on what policies, if any, should be adopted with respect to access to the broadcast media.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.497" offset="3349400">It has confined its inquiry to the non-constitutional aspects of access because the First Amendment issue was pending before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.715" offset="3394226">It added that its final decision maybe delayed and made -- made in light of the Supreme Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.410" offset="3436962">I am advised that this inquiry is proceeding actively and that the problems are under current consideration by the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="859.314" offset="3540616">Before going further, it's relevant to observe that the Commission has not here ordered anyone to do anything.What it has done is simply to stay its hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.893" offset="3602996">The ultimate question then is whether there is something in the First Amendment which requires the Commission to order broadcasters to accept editorial advertising regardless of their compliance otherwise with the Fairness Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.510" offset="3677393">Obviously, there is nothing literally in the First Amendment which leads to this result.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.893" offset="3702993">It can be found only by a rather broad construction of that Amendment, a construction incidentally which if applied there's a printed press, namely that they must accept advertising offered to -- to them, at least if paid for, would surely be regarded by them as an abridgment of the freedom of the press contrary to the explicit provisions --</text>

            <text syncTime="927.512" offset="3813439">Would you suggest, Mr. Solicitor General that if the Federal Communications Commission had this obligation that's being sought that it would mean that the Commission would also have to step in and put some limits on the amount of advertising, time which could be used and at what hours?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="953.964" stopTime="1142.850">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="953.964" offset="3919182">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.319" offset="3924616">That was clearly recognized in the opinion of the Court of Appeals which did not decide that either of these complainants was entitled to have its advertising broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.691" offset="3974144">It simply decided that the Commission must establish means for working out who could broadcast, and at what times, and if there were more people applying than there was time for, how they should be selected specifically referred to it as an abridgable right to speak and the abridgable element in it rose out of the fact that there is inherently a limited amount of time available.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.872" offset="4094830">So, as I will suggest later on, this would put the Commission into deep entanglement with the operation of the -- the actual operation and the editorial judgment of the stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.437" offset="4169122">Now, Commissioner Johnson and his dissenting opinion intimated, perhaps I could use a stronger word than that, that the way to deal with this was to abolish the Fairness Doctrine and do it on a first-come-first-serve basis and when the time was up established on some basis, then nobody else could get in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.424" offset="4261073">That we think is something which it is very hard to find in the Constitution and something which is very much an administrative matter which it is in the province of Congress through its delegatee, the Commission to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.820" offset="4346650">For that reason, I say that constitutionally I think that this case involves more of the separation of powers than it does of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.597" offset="4389804">Of course, we fully agree as the Court said in Red Lion that the First Amendment is not irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.924" offset="4423032">The underlying problem here is undoubtably a subtle one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.830" offset="4442676">When dealing with a medium to which there is inherently limited access, what is the best way to protect the public's right to hear, and see, and learn?</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.447" offset="4497115">Basically, in the present state of knowledge and in the absence of any specifically applicable provision in the First Amendment or elsewhere in the Constitution, this should be, I submit, a problem to be worked out by Congress and without the rigidity which would result from an extension of the First Amendment well beyond its language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.487" offset="4593351">Congress has exercised its power in the Communications Act and has delegated oversight and rule-making to the Communications Commission which has been actively, and effectively engaged, and the complicated, and essentially experimental task for many years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1838.534" offset="7457520">Are these not issues of the sort that Congress should determine with the aid of the agency in the light of experience and without premature constitutional restraint?</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.601" offset="7525752">The Fairness Doctrine has been developing for more than 40 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.880" offset="7546859">This has been done under the watchful eye of this Court and with recognition, as this Court said in the Pottsville Broadcasting case, that the administrative process should possessed sufficient flexibility to adjust itself to the rapidly fluctuating factors, character -- characteristic of the evolution of broadcasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.106" offset="7647796">Through the Fairness Doctrine as it has developed, there is a clear duty on the broadcaster, but he is still a private businessman as a part of a deliberately adopted system of private broadcasting, and he is not only free but obligated to exercise his journalistic discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1998.091" offset="8095744">DNC will have this Court, view broadcasting as a virtually monolithic institution in which there are three network presidents who decide what the American people will hear, and when, and how.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.888" offset="8154885">But this is not the way it works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.578" offset="8165648">As the networks agreed to show, this is a caricature of how the networks handle news and information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.089" offset="8191770">But more important, some 7000 individual broadcasters are entrusted with the responsibility of fairly informing the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="2110.022" offset="8543483">Public exposure to conflicting views in partisan voices is advanced by the Fairness Doctrine and the related requirements of the Communications Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.100" offset="8587786">Each station is responsible for determining from the public on a continuing basis what it -- the public and representative groups, and organizations regard as public issues, needs, and interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.803" offset="8642539">Now, there's discretion to present these viewpoints in a variety of ways, including hard news, commentaries, special events' coverage, documentaries and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.097" offset="8691754">But very importantly for these cases where access is being argued, stations must include under the Commission's Fairness Doctrine as part of a mix representative partisan spokesman on controversial issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.403" offset="8756955">Now, subject to these trusteeship obligations, each broadcaster exercises a journalistic function in selecting and balancing subjects, formats and speakers for the very purpose of assuring that a significant variety of important issues and competing viewpoints is affectively presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.427" offset="8841070">Some sell time or commercials to partisans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.503" offset="8857370">Others do not sell time but provide access to partisan views without charge in their normal programing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.674" offset="8890075">How this system works to serve First Amendment purposes is well-demonstrated in the BEM case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.858" offset="8918810">The uncontroverted record is that the various aspects of the Vietnam issue were repeatedly covered in WTOP's news information and public affairs programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.612" offset="8965831">Moreover, numerous partisan's spokesmen had access, in fact, to WTOP without charge to express their varying views and varying ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.912" offset="9015045">Every viewpoint in the 14 different samples of BEM commercials for which BEM sought by time on WTOP was in fact expressed over that station.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.339" offset="9068753">And furthermore, several stations in the area was different policies carried BEM's commercials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.319" offset="9096652">It would thus, I submit, be incredible to suggest that WTOP deprive the public of access to the ideas which were advocated by BEM.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.254" offset="9148374">Now, this Court has repeatedly stated that the central purpose of the First Amendment is to preserve a marketplace of ideas for the American people and it has long emphasized that the First Amendment must work differently in different context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.492" offset="9221308">And when this Court defined the First Amendment interest in broadcasting in Red Lion, it was the public's right to receive suitable access to social, political, esthetic, moral and other ideas and experiences on which the Court focused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.196" offset="9292152">In Red Lion, it was the public's right to know not the individual's right to speak which control them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.311" offset="9328619">Because of broadcasting's limited capacity, Congress and the Commission may constitutionally subordinate private claims to the paramount public interest, whether those claims are advanced by broadcasters themselves as in Red Lion or in behalf of individuals who want to speak their views.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.028" offset="9411480">There are simply more individuals who want to broadcast than there are frequencies to -- to accommodate them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2617.082" offset="10571734">But this new right, if it were established, would require our broadcasters to permit a host of commercial advertisers who spend in the neighborhood of a billion and a half dollars a year on the networks and another billion dollars a year in national television advertising to use their television and radio commercials for the expression of views on controversial issues that serve their business interest and their other interests rather than to sell their products and services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.051" offset="10707571">Now, it is apparently a common policy of broadcasters not to permit advertisers to do this now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.523" offset="10745501">The court below and all of the parties recognize that it would not serve the public interest in free speech that the expression of views and editorial advertising time were dominated by those who can most afford to pay or if a newly asserted constitutional right resulted in imbalanced treatment of public issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.770" offset="10834422">And the lower court fell back as the Solicitor General said on the Fairness Doctrine for an answer, but this would exacerbate the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.618" offset="10873814">If a broadcaster balance what Judge Wright described as a one-sided flood of editorial advertisements by presenting contrary view point's, he would have to divert kind from or ignore other subjects which warranted attention.</text>

            <text syncTime="2827.635" offset="11413922">What we have here as the Solicitor General has made clear, a decision of the Court of Appeals which through the enunciation of a new constitutional doctrine has in effect resulted in a substitution of the judgment of the Court of Appeals for that of the agency on the erroneous premise that the First Amendment requires the Government to compel broadcasters to provide paid advertising on demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.195" offset="11532204">Now, I should like to make clear that contrary to the impression that the solicitor general may have had the broadcast petitioners in this case are not here asking for a ruling by this Court that would limit the powers of the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="2983.188" offset="12036159">And that this is a responsibility not only to present the varying sides of issues to present the individual views of representatives spokesman of issues and -- but not only those two but also to affirmatively see that they cover the important public issues, that with those very substantial responsibilities which as the Chief Justice has pointed out may lead to a denial of license, if you do not carried them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.914" offset="12159039">With those very substantial or responsibilities, some broadcasters, not all, some broadcasters including Columbia Broadcasting System have included that the best way to effectuate and implement, and carry out those responsibilities is not as Judge McGowan said, to scrap the existing mechanism for a system in which money alone determines what issues are to be aired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.079" offset="12263737">In other words, Columbia Broadcasting System over a long period of years has concluded and believes from its experience that it is not the best way to cover issues to simply sell time to those who desire to and are able to purchase time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.338" offset="12332701">But this does not mean that everything is filtered through a CBS point of view or that the individual views of representative spokesman are not given.</text>

            <text syncTime="3245.508" offset="13085445">I would like to emphasize again, there must not be any misunderstanding on what we are not contending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.257" offset="13112404">We are not contending on the basis of our state action argument that the lack of state action, as we see it, takes this area outside of the power of the Federal Communications Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.481" offset="13165275">We are arguing that there is not the state action that gives rise to a constitutional right on the -- in the respondents to demand a system which Judge McGowan has correctly described as a constitutional straightjacket.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.488" offset="13233298">Now, with respect to Mr. Justice Stewart's question, let me say first that I don't think that any possible shades of difference in standards would be controlling or indeed material here because I think by any standards that there is a lack of state action, but on this specific question of the Equal Protection Clause, state action standard versus the First Amendment standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.534" offset="13353462">I think that if there is a difference, it isn't the difference between the two amendments, but it is the difference perhaps between the Equal Protection Clause as applied in racial discrimination kind of cases and other cases whether they'd be a First Amendment or equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.446" offset="13433187">I think that the long history of the Equal Protection Clause and the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment to give force to the civil rights cases, civil rights acts in case they should be declared unconstitutional that the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment was designed, not only to end historic policies of state action to enforcement segregation and enforce different treatment onto the blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.426" offset="13569128">But it was also designed to assure that no private action under the color of state law should achieve that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.258" offset="13604446">So, I think that there is a special consideration that applies in the racial cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.155" offset="13627956">Now, I said before the lunch and recess that we think that the cases before Moose Lodge established the correctness of our position that Moose Lodge merely reaffirms it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.049" offset="13679574">We have briefed the question rather extensively in our opening brief and in our reply brief, and because of limitations of time, I should like simply to say why in this particular situation we don't think you have any kind of government participation encouragement, compulsion or approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.893" offset="13778944">A close reading of the Commission's very thoughtful and articulate opinion in these cases makes clear that the Commission was not saying that it didn't want broadcasters to sell time for controversial issues, to sell advertising time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.474" offset="13853236">It wasn't saying that it approved broadcasters who do that and would be more likely to renew their licenses in those who sold such time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.579" offset="13893674">The Commission wasn't telling broadcasters what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.517" offset="13905481">What the Commission was saying, and I think very correctly was, that it would be inappropriate for it to issue an order of compulsion to broadcasters because it would interfere with their ability to carry forth their trustee responsibility of achieving a Fairness Doctrine in their own way, and it might indeed impede it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.746" offset="13982386">And those who wished to sell advertising time may do so but they still have the responsibility of carrying out the Fairness Doctrine and those who wished not to may do so, but they still have the responsibility of carrying out the Fairness Doctrine including that portion of the Fairness Doctrine which requires that partisan views be given expression and that -- and not be filtered out in the presentation process.</text>

            <text syncTime="3520.243" offset="14184364">Well, of course, in Moose Lodge at least one dissent argued that the number of liquor licenses were limited in -- in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.033" offset="14219473">But it is perfectly true that you have a licensees here and that the broadcasters can only broadcast if they hold licenses, but it is also true that the Congressional and Commission regime that was upheld in Red Lion answered that scarcity and limited number of licensees by placing on the broadcasters a heavy kind of responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.152" offset="14319992">The newspapers for example, do not have and instead Fairness Doctrine responsibility, and that implementation of the public's right to know which is the First Amendment interest that was stressed in Red Lion, not the right of an individual to get on the mic, because there are a limited number of hours, limited number days, limited number of stations, but the right of the public to know and the -- this Court unanimously in Red Lion held that the regime adopted by Congress and the Commission of -- of assuring the public's right to know would be satisfied or was illegitimate on a reasonable scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.894" offset="14458964">What we're arguing here is that the decision below, as the Commission said by compelling a particular type of activity would frustrate and interfere with that responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.534" offset="14517478">And turning now to one of the principal contentions of the respondents, and the holding of the court below, there is some kind of a constitutional invidious discrimination involved in the practice that the Commission has declined to prohibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.899" offset="14582993">And whether you call this a First Amendment violation or an equal protection violation, the contention is that if you sell time for a commercial advertisement -- advertising time, you cannot refuse to the sale of time for controversial speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.512" offset="14657390">Now, we suggest that that is not a valid contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.223" offset="14672227">We suggest that commercial matter and controversial issue matter are treated very differently under the Act because of the affirmative responsibility under the Fairness Doctrine of Red Lion as I've mentioned to cover controversial issues, so that the broadcaster who won't let the controversial issue into his advertising time, also keeps the -- the -- a commercial broadcaster out of his program time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.726" offset="14786226">The Commission will not allow broadcasters to have a program like the commercials.So that what actually happens is that under the scheme of the act and the Commission's rules, a controversial speech is given a preferred position as against commercials speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.382" offset="14856861">Now, this doesn't mean that any individual has the right to come in and demand that he can put on a commercial, no individual has a right to demand that he come and -- and be given time on the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.501" offset="14909419">In both cases, the broadcaster exercises discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.450" offset="14925197">The cases which have been relied upon by the respondents in the court below, we submit, are not controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.887" offset="14950902">There are lower court cases dealing with busses where you have no system of information other than the advertising space and a state, a supporter or state partially supported newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.938" offset="15007117">And then the newspaper cases there's a conflict with the Evans and Richter's case in the Third Circuit which says, there's no right of access to a journalistic media even though it's supported by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.522" offset="15049435">We think that those cases are not in point here, what is in point here is that there's a reasonable classification, if you will, a reasonable determination was made by the -- been made by the broadcasters in which the agency charge with expertise in the field has found to be not unreasonable, if the broadcaster wants to do it that way as a message of achieving his fairness obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.353" offset="15148805">One final point Mr. Jennes emphasized at some of the -- the dangers of an unrestricted right of purchase of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.375" offset="15196871">And he pointed out that that isn't just the organizations that are registered in getting on, but we also have commercial advertisers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.443" offset="15225187">Now, there's about a billion and a half dollars of network, television, commercial advertising sales during the course of the year and if -- if you say that there's a constitutional right to put into your advertisements, controversial issue matter then presumably that billion and half dollars of commercial advertising can include as much as any given commercial advertiser desires to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.849" offset="15342738">Most broadcasters today make an effort not to include in their commercial advertising such materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.743" offset="15370324">Now you've been pointed two examples of cases where broadcasters have not complied without or cases where the line has been -- has been crossed, and what appear to be a product commercial swapped over into an advocacy of a position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.471" offset="15425285">And in that case the Fairness Doctrine applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.836" offset="15434689">But most broadcasters today make the effort to make that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.628" offset="15449840">I think it's a very important distinction because I think that the -- in agenda would indeed as the Commission said the -- as set by the affluent if we set up a constitutional principle of this kind, and I don't think that the any amount of balancing by the broadcaster could unskew what have been skewed in that fashion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3882.589" offset="15633742">As far as the Democratic National Committee is concerned, the issue before this Court, the central question, the same central question we began dealing with -- with the networks in March -- in April of 1970 and with the FCC in the late spring of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.593" offset="15713782">It is, are the public air ways which are the most powerful and forceful means of communication in our democratic society the greatest democracy in the world are these airways to be used to promote the sale of soap, deodorants, mouth washers, and brassieres, and not to promote the exchange of ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.487" offset="15809285">And the legal issue is whether Federal Communications Commission consisted with the Communications Act and the First Amendment to the Constitution can permit the three major networks, and the 7000 broadcasters of this nation to impose an absolute ban on all radio and television broadcasts paid for by the major political parties if they discussed controversial issues of public importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3957.599" offset="15933733">The rule we asked for is a very simple rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.482" offset="15957347">It simply requested the Commission and I quote “That a broadcaster may not as general policy refuse to sell time to responsible entities such as the Democratic National Committee for the solicitation of funds and for comment on public issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="4125.206" offset="16604244">In -- in response to the question whether they should go back to back with it, we have argued in the whole series of other matters with the networks and with the Communications Commission about that right, and the only time -- the only time we've ever been granted that was when Senator Muskie and President Nixon spoke back to back in 1970 on election eve.</text>
            <text syncTime="4148.279" offset="16696508">Aside from that, we've never been able to establish that as a right and I have to say that I don't think it's -- it recognizes the right by the FCC or most people in the communication.</text>

            <text syncTime="4198.170" offset="16896084">I think it's important to note that the Federal Communications Commission granted part of the DNC request.</text>
            <text syncTime="4207.440" offset="16933177">The Federal Communications Commission said, that a broadcaster could not refuse as a general policy to accept spot announcements for the solicitation of funds, it denied the rule we -- we requested insofar as that rule involved the discussion of controversial issues of public importance, and the Commission opinion below in no way attempted to tell us how make that distinction even in a 60-seconds spot soliciting funds for a political party.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.229" offset="17080299">The Court of Appeals affirmed the Federal Communications Commission insofar as it granted us the right to purchase spot announcements to solicit funds, and reversed the Federal Communications Commission holding that on absolute ban, which is what we are talking about, an absolute ban by the broadcasters and the networks violated the Communications Act and the First Amendment to the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="4298.655" offset="17297951">The broadcasters and the FCC opinion blesses their attitude in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4306.306" offset="17328567">The broadcasters in a sense and precisely are saying that they have the right to impose an absolute ban, that they can explain to the American people, what the views of the Democratic Party are or what the views of the Republican Party are or what views of any individual spokesman for them are, better than that spokesman can do it themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="5276.702" offset="21210154">That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.747" offset="21234395">There are, I might note, according to the Census Bureau, about a hundred religions in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="5288.957" offset="21259160">Two or three of them have -- have purchased time on Sunday mornings for religious shows and it hasn't destroyed television on Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="5297.032" offset="21291551">The other 95 haven't come bouncing in to acquire that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5303.810" offset="21318614">Some corporations are -- are affectively granted the right to purchase entire amounts of time, witness, as we say in our brief, some of the National Geographic and the -- and Xerox shows that have appeared on the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="5320.005" offset="21383398">The broadcasters set up in their briefs a whole chamber of horrors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5330.644" offset="21425925">The only one of which was discussed here this morning was the wealthy man, a straw man, which -- with which I have dealt briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5339.633" offset="21461870">As far as the remaining points that they raised about administrative difficulties, I would urge the Justices of this Court or their clerks to review the briefs in the Red Lion case and the arguments of the broadcasters in the Red Lion case, and they will find a neat and remarkable similarity between the arguments they made there and the arguments they make here today about administrative horror.</text>
            <text syncTime="5366.038" offset="21567509">But today, CBS in its brief before this Court and before the Commission and the Court of Appeal says, “Their public issue of broadcasting has never been better.</text>
            <text syncTime="5377.791" offset="21614529">It improves every year since Red Lion.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5381.294" offset="21628531">So, I cannot, with all due respect, give and I do not think this Court should give just as the Court of Appeals do not give, much credence to this administrative horrors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5394.112" offset="21679835">And the bottom-line on that point, I submit, Mr. Justices is this, in Red Lion, in the unanimous decision, the Court of Appeals of the -- this Court noted that it would not decide the case on the basis of extreme possibilities or extreme examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="5413.201" offset="21756217">The Solicitor General indeed, in his argument in Red Lion urged that particular point upon this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5420.890" offset="21786937">In case of doubt, this Court opted to go with the First Amendment values and the rights of free speech, noting and inviting the broadcasters to go back to the Federal Communications Commission and ultimately come back here if any of the horrors that they envision -- envisioned any of their nightmares ever came to pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="5443.216" offset="21876276">None of them ever did come to pass and the same kind of doubt, if any one has it, in this room besides the broadcasters of dangers should be treated in the same kind of way in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5458.214" offset="21936253">We believe that that opting for free speech is consistent with everything, with a whole host of decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5470.107" offset="21983796">We believe that this Court and in effect, opted for free speech and the (Inaudible) case in a situation of dangerous, explosive, dirty, and outrageous fighting between truckers and railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.559" offset="22037608">In Times v Sullivan, this Court opted for free speech in a situation where a newspaper lied.</text>
            <text syncTime="5491.645" offset="22070000">In the Pentagon Papers this Court opted for free speech even though the national security of this country might have been involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5500.172" offset="22104064">In this case, the only inhibition on opting for free speech or a host of possibles that the network's claim may come to pass and that they may hurt the system of broadcasting.</text>

            <text syncTime="5749.810" offset="23102568">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5755.891" offset="23126915">Because I -- I feel that perhaps the argument has -- has taken a path of obstruction, I would beg, leave to try to focus upon the specific facts present in the BEM case to illustrate the exact nature of the issue before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5774.537" offset="23201520">The narrowness of that issue has held by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="5779.442" offset="23221164">The issue is one of discrimination, broadcasters voluntarily determine that in order raise revenue, they're going to put a certain portion of their airtime up for sale and market it to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="5791.536" offset="23269543">And if those other persons are going to use that time to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="5795.722" offset="23286262">BEM approaches -- approached the broadcaster that did just that with 18 out of every 60 minutes is on the air, WTOP Radio Station sought to purchase time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5806.432" offset="23329102">It was turned down, not for any of the reasons suggested by the petitioners, not because the speech was obscene, indecent, defamatory or might somehow otherwise be in violation of some specific law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5821.477" offset="23389288">But solely and exclusively on the basis of a policy which is set out at page 297 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="5827.389" offset="23412903">I quote, “It is the policy of Post-Newsweek Stations, radio and television stations not to sell spot announcement time to individuals or groups in order to set forth a point of view on any controversial subject of pubic importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5844.049" offset="23479568">And that presents the clear, narrow issue that was decided by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="5848.075" offset="23495659">That's a flat ban on selling time which is regularly marketed to commercial spokesman to people who wish to speak about controversial subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="5859.315" offset="23540590">In brief, such a policy as we view the -- the ruling of the court below and as this case is presented involves no question of creating a new constitutional right -- of right of access as -- as it's phrased.</text>
            <text syncTime="5873.878" offset="23598895">Rather, it deals specifically with a question of whether or not assuming for the moment, I will address state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5880.332" offset="23624704">Assuming that the action of the broadcaster is either itself state action or because of firm and approved by the regulatory agency state action, whether or not this discrimination, barring for First Amendment protected speech, in and of itself, is violative of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5899.315" offset="23700668">It doesn't mean that every person has a right to speak, but rather a right not to be excluded on such a discriminatory ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="5907.680" offset="23734105">We would suggest primarily that -- that reading cases like Valentine against Chrestensen, and Breard versus Alexandria, the -- the approach taken by the broadcasters in terms of their marketing of time turns constitutional values on their head because this Court has time and again in those cases held that the First Amendment protects political speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="5929.341" offset="23820727">It does not protect commercial speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="5931.490" offset="23829295">It somehow rather the commercial speaker when he wishes to -- to address particular issue or the merits of his product or otherwise in his own words, may come and buy time on the nation's most power communications medium, and when -- when editorial speakers be they political parties or voluntary groups like BEM or civil rights organizations as in the case of New York Times against Sullivan wished to pay same rate, to buy the same time, to address what they regard is the most important issues of the day, they discriminatorily refused any opportunity to purchase that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="6384.091" offset="25639685">The Commission rejected both of those approaches.So what the Commission in essence has done here is it's given the broadcasters carte blanche to employ a discriminatory policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="6709.356" offset="26940792">And no such license shall be construed to create any right beyond the terms, conditions, and periods of the license.</text>

            <text syncTime="6731.855" offset="27030758">This differs from -- from virtually every other state action case they were -- that -- that this Court has ever been approached with including in fact Burton against Wilmington Parking Authority where there was no specific statutory requirement that the parking authority maintained control over each and every square foot of the parking lot they have built.</text>
            <text syncTime="6752.267" offset="27112469">Time and again, this Court when faced with -- with the question of the way in which the Government regulates broadcasting has -- has expressed in -- in the broadest of possible terms that the manner in which the Government exercises this -- this control.</text>

            <text syncTime="7332.639" offset="29433919">That's the only ground on which we were kept out.</text>
            <text syncTime="7335.071" offset="29443636">If you look at the policy that was -- of -- of WTOP Radio Station on which the business executive group was excluded, the only ground on which it was excluded was the controversiality of its message.</text>
            <text syncTime="7345.840" offset="29486686">No other ground or whatever and strictly that narrow discrimination that we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="7350.310" offset="29504658">That number of -- of what I would regard as false horrors have been paraded to the Court as to what might happen if it were acknowledged that there is no right not to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="7362.761" offset="29554395">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="7362.906" offset="29555022">I'm sorry, no right to discriminate or a right to be required not to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="7367.926" offset="29575084">One -- somehow or other that the rich might buy up all the time, I think that that's the best speculative danger of -- because we -- if -- if we look at the nature of -- of editorial advertising in the newspapers, we find it for the most part, editorial advertising is utilized by disadvantaged groups that somehow or other feel their views have already been excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="7390.502" offset="29665364">The -- the rich on the other hand are not monolithic by any means and if General Motors in fact, decided that rather than -- than trying to sell cars it was going to use all the time it could buy up to talk about political issues.One that would run completely counter to the situation we see in -- in the newspaper area where we find very little politicizing by -- by commercial interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="7413.534" offset="29757524">Secondly, that -- that subject wasn't briefed to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7416.263" offset="29768391">But thirdly, even if it were done, even if -- if corporations utilized advertising time to address issues rather to simply demerits of products is that necessarily and undesirable First Amendment consequent so long as we have the Fairness Doctrine to assure that there is balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="7431.956" offset="29831189">Now, another one of the dangers that's been advanced is that somehow or other the Fairness Doctrine will be wrecked if we have it -- have a -- a requirement that editorial speech not be excluded from advertising time.</text>
            <text syncTime="7444.997" offset="29883329">And again, there's no basis or whatever for reaching this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="7448.782" offset="29898480">Numerous stations is acknowledged by the broadcasters already carried editorial advertisements.</text>
            <text syncTime="7455.977" offset="29927320">None of them have come forward to say that somehow or other as a result of our doing this we're about to go under, we're being swamped.</text>
            <text syncTime="7462.435" offset="29953128">The Cullman Doctrine which requires that broadcasters give free time for response only comes about in two circumstances.One, where a controversial -- or three circumstances -- controversial issue of public important isn't -- has not been dealt with fairly by the broadcaster, where there's an imbalance in the broadcasters' program.</text>
            <text syncTime="7480.493" offset="30025331">And one of the cigarette cases that the FCC has held an 8-to-1 balance of pro cigarette to anti cigarette advertisements is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="7487.499" offset="30053334">So the broadcasters have tremendous latitude in which to determine what is balanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="7492.281" offset="30072456">Secondly, no one is paid to come forward to put on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="7496.002" offset="30087398">And thirdly, the broadcaster in his own programming is not in one way or another elected to present the other side only in those circumstances, must they give time free to someone to present an alternative view point?</text>
            <text syncTime="7508.228" offset="30136299">Now, remember, we're -- we're not talking about every issue in the world, we're talking about issues that are both controversial and of public importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="7516.354" offset="30168795">Notably, those issues which not only the Fairness Doctrine applies to but -- but are specifically excluded under the flat ban policy that we asked to this Court to declare unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="7527.259" offset="30212368">Now, if an issue is both controversial and of public importance, presumably a broadcaster if he's fulfilling his Fairness Doctrine obligation is already going to be covered -- covering that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="7536.501" offset="30249357">It's very unlikely that letting on a particular spokesman is going to throw this programming into imbalance and the facts of the BEM case indicate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7545.060" offset="30283630">WTOP has argued that it has presented both sides of the war in -- in extreme balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="7551.469" offset="30309230">Keeping in mind the eight to one ratio that the Commission has held to be reasonable selling three or four minutes to one group or another group to express their views on the issue to supplement what the broadcasters already put on in news time.</text>
            <text syncTime="7564.654" offset="30361997">He's not going to throw his programming into imbalance.</text>
            <text syncTime="7567.464" offset="30373177">The one place in which -- in which we might find a problem, the broadcaster being faced with either an economic burden under the Fairness Doctrine or -- or encourage it upon his discretion as to what issue should be covered is where a new issue comes up.</text>
            <text syncTime="7581.972" offset="30431274">Or at issue that the broadcaster for one reason or another, even though its controversial, and even though it's a public importance, a broadcaster is elected not to put on the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="7590.482" offset="30465337">And some member of the public feeling that it's so important has gone forth with his money and paid the money, and bought time, and raised that issue, then, the broadcaster obviously not having covered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7601.759" offset="30510373">Probably, he's not been fulfilling his Fairness Doctrine obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7604.420" offset="30521031">He may have overlooked the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="7606.485" offset="30529285">And so, in furtherance of First Amendment objective of what -- of robust wide open debate, a new issue would have been brought to public attention, and how the broadcaster deals with it need not impose any great economic burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="7617.666" offset="30574007">Primarily, the broadcaster will deal with that issue by either dealing with the news time; perhaps another member of the public will come forward and buy time to present -- present the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="7627.968" offset="30615280">But in any event, the broadcaster is going to be subjected to no burden that he -- he's not -- he's not already required to address under -- under the Fairness Doctrine because we're only talking about controversial issues and public importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="7639.114" offset="30659793">We're not talking about those kinds of issues which the broadcaster somehow or other suggest they should -- they should exclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="7644.660" offset="30682049">One of the broadcasters suggest that trivial issues might be excludable.Well it's trivial but it's not controversial and of public importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="7651.861" offset="30710784">We're only talking about the burning issues of the day, those very issues that the broadcaster must address in his programming time under the Fairness Doctrine and must address with balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="7664.193" offset="30760103">I think that -- that I've -- I've covered pretty much those areas that -- that were not covered by Mr. Califano.</text>
            <text syncTime="7673.468" offset="30797197">Except to suggest that -- that the question of programming time as far as we're concerned in the context of this case, must be looked at very narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="7683.346" offset="30836799">Notably, if a broadcaster regularly markets programming time to others, then again, it would be invidious to say, “I'll market it to you if you want to talk about a commercial subject but not about a controversial one.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7693.632" offset="30877863">On the other hand, if a broadcaster markets only spot advertising time, which is -- which is the case in -- with the number of broadcasters then that's what we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="7701.865" offset="30910882">And we're saying, “That's what he can't discriminate.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7703.979" offset="30919241">But nonetheless, the basic question is discrimination and basic judgment is the broadcasters as to what he is going to subject to -- what -- what type of time he is going to put up for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="7714.830" offset="30962709">When he puts time up for sale, then he is to be held the requirement that he need -- that he not discriminate invidiously between that which is controversial and that which is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="7723.940" offset="30999176">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="7737.594" offset="31053720">Mr. Chief Justice, may I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7743.387" offset="31076916">Questions were asked to counsel for DNC.</text>
            <text syncTime="7750.730" offset="31106278">On what section is the Communications Act, they were relying it has been violated by the Commission's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="7760.791" offset="31146506">In that connection, I would like to call to this Court's attention to emphasize that on these four occasions, Congress has had opportunities to prescribe a right of access for the presentation of contrasting views on controversial issues and each instance has refused to go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="7781.373" offset="31228844">First of all that the Radio Act of 1927 was referenced to candidates for public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="7788.487" offset="31257370">They did put in a provision which was carried over again when the Act was reenacted as Communications Act of 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="7796.033" offset="31287463">That time has made available by the broadcaster to one candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="7800.036" offset="31303555">He must likewise make available time to other candidates for the same office.</text>
            <text syncTime="7806.300" offset="31328528">But the statute went on -- the statute immediately went on with (Inaudible) to this effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="7811.604" offset="31349739">No obligation is imposed upon any licensee to allow the use of its station for any such candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="7820.805" offset="31386624">That was the provisions up until 1959, except for the standard of public interest and the report on editorializing in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="7836.075" offset="31447646">However, in 1959, after the Lar Daly episode, Congress restricted still further, this equal time requirement even for candidates by eliminating bona fide a newscast, by eliminating bona fide news interviews, bona fide documentaries, and on the spot coverage bona fide news events.</text>
            <text syncTime="7863.169" offset="31556002">Now, we come in next to the -- the Campaign Expenditure Act of 1971 which became effective April 7, 1972, but Congress provided that licensees could be revoked for willful or repeated failure to allow reasonable acces to or to permit purchase of reasonable amount of time for the use of a broadcasting station by a legally qualified candidate for Federal elective office.</text>
            <text syncTime="7896.739" offset="31690376">Federal only, not State.</text>
            <text syncTime="7900.565" offset="31705631">Now, you all notice that they use the word “or” either access of permit purchase of reasonable time.</text>
            <text syncTime="7907.833" offset="31734680">It doesn't say purchase and purchase their reasonable time.Congress was perfectly familiar after 1959 and after this Court's decision in Red Lion.</text>
            <text syncTime="7920.341" offset="31784730">That broadcaster was under an obligation to see that all sides of controversial issues were presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="7930.965" offset="31827257">And therefore, the stations are under a duty to provide time either free of charge or on a paid basis and that is a policy which most of the -- the three networks for the most part have followed, with reference the controversial issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="7949.364" offset="31900818">We present the time free.</text>
            <text syncTime="7952.130" offset="31911894">Now, Congress -- the Commission has gone further after the expenditure -- the Campaign Expenditure Act was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="7961.114" offset="31947839">Question was asked by Meredith Publishing Company which owns several television stations and radio stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="7966.727" offset="31970304">Can we continue our policy under that statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="7970.518" offset="31985455">I'm making time available free only to candidates and not selling time and thereby keeping a complete balance, and not the richest candidate getting more spots, and the poorest candidate being (Inaudible) only by one spot, because on time for sale for -- for candidates for public office, the Fairness Doctrine as I understand is not directly applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="7995.915" offset="32087019">The Commission held that Meredith Publishing Company could -- could continue to make time available on a free basis and not be required to sell time for -- for campaign purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="8015.036" offset="32163506">And that's even and -- I think that we have therefore an a fortiori situation when we get into the subject of controversial issues.So we do not have here a question of selling time to the commercial advertising, and refusing to sell time for the person who wants to expose ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="8039.819" offset="32262666">We sell time to the commercial advertiser to advertise his product.</text>
            <text syncTime="8043.840" offset="32278758">We give time for the presentation of controversial issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="8082.127" offset="32431835">And much -- much emphasis placed on United Broadcasting Company case in 1945 by the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="8097.428" offset="32493066">The Commission was groping with this Fairness Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="8102.337" offset="32512711">It's true there's some mention made of it in -- back in 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="8107.248" offset="32532355">Generalizations, but it was not until a report on editorializing in 1949 that the Commission finally expounded his Fairness Doctrine in a much the same form than it is at present except for the additional provisions about, first, to attack rules and matters of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="8131.390" offset="32628903">We do not consider United Broadcasting Company case, so therefore as controlling in view of the 1941 report on editorializing and the Fairness Doctrine itself as announced by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="8145.369" offset="32684805">And I would like therefore to call to the Commission's attention -- to the Court's attention as a more authoritative pronouncement than the United Broadcasting Company case, a decision by a different panel of this Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia both before this case was resolved and after this case was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="8181.228" offset="32828270">Where they say, “We believed DNC's position to be fallacious and point to our recent decision in Green v. FCC where we state that no individual or group has a right of access to the air.</text>
