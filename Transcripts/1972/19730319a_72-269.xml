            <label>Ms. Jean M. Coon</label>
            <text syncTime="50.029" offset="303522">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.296" offset="316583">The statute at issue on this appeal, Chapter 138 of the New York Laws of 1970, provides for the payment by the State to non-public schools within the State, specific sums of money as partial reimbursement of the expenses of record-keeping, testing, and reporting incurred by the non-public schools in complying with requirements of state law and regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.308" offset="416580">The laws and regulations referred to have been enacted for the purposes of the examination and inspection of the non-public schools by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.279" offset="452524">The examination of this statute to determine its validity, must we feel be made in the perspective of the total historical educational picture in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.220" offset="496201">From the creation of the University of the State of New York in 1787, the regents of that University and subsequently the Commissioner of Education as its administrative arm had a general supervision over all educational institutions in the State of New York, both public and private.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.473" offset="565269">All private educational institutions from elementary grades through colleges receive their charges from the Board of Regents.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.572" offset="597661">The state education law gives the Commissioner of Education the power to examine and inspect private as well as public institutions of learning, to determine whether or not they comply with the compulsory attendance and instructional requirements of the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.767" offset="662444">The state education law not only requires children to regularly attend some school, either public or private, but sets minimum standards of education including course content which must be met by the schools which these children attend, in order that their attendance does comply with the compulsory attendance laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.277" offset="752515">The importance of this supervisory function to the States concerned, relative to its children's education was recognized by the framers of the state constitution in 1894 when in adding a provision prohibiting aid to sectarian schools, they specifically accepted expenditures of money for the purposes of examination and inspection, in the carrying out of this function of examination and inspection and general supervision over the education provided by non-public schools in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.209" offset="884172">The State requires the schools to perform certain testing, record-keeping, and reporting services to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.542" offset="917504">Among these are the administration of tests, including Regents' examinations which are statewide tests of specific subject matter achievement, Pupil Evaluation Program Tests in grade six and nine, and other general statewide evaluation tests also used in public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.494" offset="993364">And in addition, the regulations of the Commissioner of Education require the non-public schools to conduct a continuing program of individual pupil testing in all grades to provide an adequate basis for evaluating pupil achievement.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.174" offset="1068074">In addition to the testing program, the non-public schools are required to maintain health records, records of marks, attendance records, provide information under the basic educational data system, which includes statistical information as to students, teachers, curricula offered, physical plans and so forth, and of secondary schools, additional data on a more detailed basis than in the basic educational data system.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.984" offset="1175280">These requirements imposed upon non-public schools by law or regulations involve considerable addition expense to the schools for which, immediately prior to the enactment of Chapter I38, the schools were not compensated.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.413" offset="1237034">While immediately prior to the enactment of the statute, the schools were not compensated, the State has had a long history of providing some compensation to some non-public schools in recognition of the cost burden imposed by the State in assuring that the requirements of the compulsory attendance laws are being met.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.516" offset="1317386">Beginning in 1892, appropriations remain annually to so called academies for services in connection with the compulsory attendance laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.311" offset="1356570">Those academies included sectarian and non-sectarian, secondary non-public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.182" offset="1380080">The provision for such compensation was retained in the state's education law until 1930, but even after repeal in that year, appropriations continued to be made and in the State's local assistance appropriation bills, in connection with the attendance requirements of academic pupils.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.711" offset="1450193">Only in the years between 1968 and the enactment of the legislation at issue here for no payments made to any non-public schools for these purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.384" offset="1492929">The legislation adopted in 1970 therefore, merely reinstated a past practice of compensating non-public schools for record-keeping and examination services required by the state updated the amount paid to reflect current economic conditions and made the base of payment more equitable by including all non-public schools at all-state imposed examination and recordkeeping requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.197" offset="1600136">The cost analysis studies made for the State Education Department, in which there are exhibits in this case, exhibits D and G in a separate folder of exhibits submitted to the Court, and which were made by three individuals acting independently of each other, demonstrate that the payments made to the non-public schools are justified in amount, and are still substantially less for the actual cost of performance of the services.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.975" offset="1719254">Appellees do not dispute these conclusions, except by alleging that the administration of test is a part of the teaching function of the non-public schools and then consequently New York is paying the schools for the cost of education.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.986" offset="1771290">This is a matter of perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.694" offset="1778186">From the State's point of view, we are not paying the schools to administer tests as part of the educational program of the schools, but rather as a method of evaluating the achievement of the schools in meeting minimum standards of education.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.125" offset="1835865">This assumes that the teaching function per se has been completed prior to the administration of a test as a measuring device, and we submit that is the more reasonable viewpoint on the aspect of the State's payment -- in this -- this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.229" offset="1896260">The past decisions of this Court have not prohibited all payments or benefits to non-public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.059" offset="1919561">Justice, they have not permitted all payments or benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.016" offset="1935444">In Everson, the activities which were described as prohibited were those directed to the aid of religion as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.967" offset="1963238">In McGowan this Court observed that the establishment cost does not ban state or federal regulations of conduct whose effect merely happens to coincide with the tenets of some religions.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.394" offset="2004929">Again in Everson, the Court expressed the concept of neutrality, stating that the Constitution does not require the State to be the adversary of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.944" offset="2043173">In both (Inaudible) and McGowan, this Court discussed the intent and effect test by which a statute is measured as to whether it has a secular legislative intent and a primary effect which neither aids nor inhibits religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.749" offset="2094373">In Walz the test by which legislations were being measured was expanded to include an evaluation as to where the statute of issue created an excessive entanglement between church and state.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.628" offset="2141915">In discussing whether or not the New York statute here at issue meets objections under each of these tests, we must bear in mind the observation of this Court's opinion in Lemon that the line between permissible and impermissible legislation is not a wall but rather a blurred, indistinct and variable barrier depending on all the circumstances of a particular relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="1635.537" offset="6645530">So, under the bottom of the page, the overwhelming the majority of tests given on public and non-public schools alike are formulated, administered, and created by teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.614" offset="6689834">These are the tests which take care of two-thirds of the whole cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.691" offset="6714180">Eliminate that and you have an amount which is considered to be substantially less than the amount which is given per student.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.362" offset="6760782">But even that is not relevant because the State takes a position that is irrelevant how much money is spent for these mandated services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.866" offset="6814804">The amount is given per pupil and not on the basis of what the cost is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.606" offset="6837791">These cost analysis were not applied by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.964" offset="6847195">They were made in litem for the purpose of preparing for this -- for this case after we brought the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.642" offset="6869974">And that -- and the -- the stake -- states in this interrogatory, it was a part of interrogatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.595" offset="6885752">It does not ask what the money is for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.891" offset="6894947">It doesn't require any reporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.834" offset="6902680">And it takes a position that the amount is fixed by law and this is the amount which is unchangeable whether the costs go up or go down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.252" offset="6944371">Now, there's another point which I'd like to call the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.336" offset="6960671">I think Ms. Coon is not correct in stating that this money is used to reimburse for expenditures already made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.804" offset="6998601">The law was passed in 1970 to take effect the following year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.169" offset="7020022">And during each year, the school gets per pupil according to the amount of students in that -- during that current year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.242" offset="7068296">The first year, the school is allowed to choose, the months of September, October, November, which month it will take to measure the number of students to test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.005" offset="7111346">And for that year, that is a number taken for $28 or $45.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.127" offset="7135901">Thereafter, the year before the current year is used as a base year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.761" offset="7162441">But the payment is not made for the base year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.495" offset="7169337">The -- they've already been paid for the base year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.854" offset="7178742">The payment is made for the current year and that's a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.225" offset="7192221">That in the event that there is a difference between the student enrollment during the current year, or the base year, an adjustment is made accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.879" offset="7222836">Moreover, the Act provides that the payment is to be made in two portions.One is payable January 15th and the other is paid April 15th for the current year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.953" offset="7279156">Now April 15th is two-and-a-half months before the end of the school year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.040" offset="7295561">There is nothing in the Act or in its administration which prevents a school teacher or school principal, or superintendent of the school of the religious schools saying to the teachers, “We're short of money for our religious teaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.093" offset="7351777">We're short of money for our religious worship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.592" offset="7365778">We've got to carve out in-class tests.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.762" offset="7386467">No more class testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.967" offset="7391274">Use all that money for the two-and-a-half months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.018" offset="7403395">We're getting it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.350" offset="7408724">Use all that money to pay for catechism, to pay for religious worship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.974" offset="7435264">According to the State of New York, that is perfectly permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.445" offset="7449161">There are no strings attached to this money, no reporting, no auditing, only the -- only auditing required is to establish how many students there are during the year.</text>

            <text syncTime="1863.283" offset="7556472">Either you give money which can be used for religious purposes which the Court has said is unconstitutional, in which case you have the (Inaudible) of financing religious instruction, or you audit and you supervise as they try to do in Lemon which is this (Inaudible) of entanglement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.972" offset="7639228">The answer is of course that the law is unconstitutional, but that's not unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.515" offset="7653439">That's what the Court said in Lemon against Kurtzman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.862" offset="7662843">That's what Court said in Tilton against Richardson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.213" offset="7672247">In Tilton against Richardson, the Court report said, an unrestricted grant of money, which is partly used to build a building, which after 20 years may be used to hold religious classes, that's unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2120.178" offset="8584129">This is substantiated and it is established by the interrogatories was submitted to the state and their response to it on the appendix pages 87A and 88A in which the State says the qualifying schools are not required to submit the reports and copy for the moneys received and how they are expended.</text>

            <text syncTime="2178.738" offset="8818291">The schools -- the first school received $77,878 under the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2741.782" offset="11070464">The teacher asks questions, the student answers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2757.356" offset="11132844">You give the teacher what the teacher wants, how?</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.049" offset="11143607">Now, you take the two schools here, the Catholic Academy and the north -- the Hebrew Academy and the Catholic School.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.137" offset="11175894">I am certain, that a student in a Catholic Central High School would not answer a question on history on the Reformation the way the same question would be answered by a student in Lutheran High School.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.405" offset="11237021">Or take a question on the origins of Christianity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.422" offset="11249037">I am sure that a student in the North Shore Hebrew Academy would not, if he wants to pass the course, answer that question the same way that a student in the Catholic Central School will do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.657" offset="11302013">Teaching is two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.388" offset="11316955">One way, and the least effective way, is for this teacher to stand in front and lecture and lecture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.095" offset="11335764">And then send the students home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.410" offset="11340988">A most effective way is for the teacher to get it from the students.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leo Pfeffer</label>
            <text syncTime="2847.904" offset="11495006">Well the -- the -- my answer to that would be, that the ROTC is generally as far as I know up until now, is at college level, and in Tilton versus Richardson, this Court held that there are more liberal rules with respect to -- at the college level than expect the elementary and high school level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.784" offset="11566477">So that, I don't think it would necessarily be the same answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.543" offset="11593540">I would have reservations on the elementary and secondary sides and level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.900" offset="11610990">It would certainly have reservations on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.631" offset="11621857">Now, in Lemon, this Court said that, in Lemon and DiCenso that the State of Rhode Island and the State of Pennsylvania were obligated under the Constitution, as well as in the statute to see to it that the money given to the teachers was used only for secular teaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.168" offset="11732093">That it couldn't have given the money and say, use it for secular teaching but make no examination, no verification whether it's been used as a purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.326" offset="11776711">And then the courts went and said, well that very verification -- you see, the answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's questions, that very auditing -- that very surveillance, that very required constitutionally and statutory requirement, assurance that it is not used for sectarian instruction, or religious worship, that involve, that surveillance which from Walz through Lemon, the Court said is forbidden by the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.896" offset="11890918">Yes, it is true that -- that if -- if there were no audits here as there isn't, we call any stuff constitutional because it is financing, subsidizing religious education and if there is some audits if there is surveillance and there is policing, we say it's unconstitutional because it involves entanglement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.982" offset="11963329">But that's not our dilemma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.505" offset="11969390">That's a dilemma of the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.679" offset="11978062">That's a dilemma of a history of over a 150, 175 years where State after State, court after court, constitution after constitution said you cannot do what you're trying to do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.014" offset="12023411">You cannot take tax-raised funds and use it to pay part of the upgraded course whether it's required by law or not required law of church schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.627" offset="12065834">This is what it's all about is what the Establishment Clause says and this what the Court said in Yoder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.413" offset="12085060">That long before there was a public school system, there were the a religion clauses and that's the policies, the constitutional interests which were set forth in the religion clause, as to date, our educational system -- our educational system had to shape itself to the establishment in the Free Exercise Clause, not the establishment of Free Exercise Clause to shape themselves and fashion themselves to the educational interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.059" offset="12179623">This is what this case is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.585" offset="12185684">This -- this case says, the court below says, you cannot take an import element of the budget of a church school in order for you to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.450" offset="12229151">You cannot take it off the voluntary contribution of those who adhere to and make an -- an obligation of every taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.434" offset="12261125">That's a violation of what, the Establishment Clause of a Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3376.686" offset="13610088">A contribution toward that but the point that I make is, the school, whatever it is, the school is -- out of the money it has performed the services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.652" offset="13645928">It gets back a partial, not larger, a partial reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.013" offset="13671424">That partial reimbursement of course becomes its own money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.691" offset="13686157">Let me go back to an analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.267" offset="13692426">What about this parent in the Everson bus case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.726" offset="13706324">He paid out of his own pockets for a bus fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.609" offset="13717817">He later got it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.104" offset="13731819">Was that money segregated or tainted or marked by sectarian influence?</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.699" offset="13754180">No, he got it back, he could use it to put into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.111" offset="13763793">He could use it to go to the races.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.671" offset="13774033">It was a reimbursement for a legitimate expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.206" offset="13788244">So, with all respect, I say that this talk about audits is completely beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.791" offset="13818546">The point is that the school is required to perform a large number, an appalling number of administrative services for the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.938" offset="13855117">I want to cite an illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.618" offset="13861804">I just happened to notice that the records of attendance and other basic data in connection with these -- these applications are required by the State to be maintained, opened to inspection of the schools' files for at least 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.387" offset="13940903">Did the parent in the textbook case who was relieved of the cost of buying textbooks?</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.873" offset="13970892">Did he get sectarian -- was it sectarian money?</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.279" offset="13984475">Was it sectarian reimbursement?</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.781" offset="13990536">No, the point I'm making is, that if this is a reimbursement, where funds are already expended, it's completely immaterial where the money goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.236" offset="14048319">The partial reimbursement was deliberately fixed by law in the judgment of the legislature which should be conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.602" offset="14085831">And it was fixed in such a way that there would be no overage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.141" offset="14115924">The cost studies made after the suit was brought, all bear that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.002" offset="14135359">Let me give you just one little illustration from one of the exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.530" offset="14157511">In mode two, they studied how much it costs the schools to perform the mandated services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.537" offset="14185514">They took a public high school and a Catholic high school and a public elementary school and a Catholic elementary school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.860" offset="14210800">They applied the same bookkeeping tests to both of them to see how much it costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.361" offset="14228773">Holy Trinity High School in Hicksville for doing the State's bookkeeping for it, cost that school $232.90 per pupil, and they got back $45.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.484" offset="14285302">Hicksville High School at the same time, same town, it cost them $361.72, one-third more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.021" offset="14323440">Corpus Christi Elementary School and Mineola Catholic, it cost them $77.56 to do the state's work for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.512" offset="14361370">They got back $27.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.758" offset="14370356">Willis Avenue Elementary Public School across the street, cost them $474.12 to do the same services.</text>

            <text syncTime="3618.262" offset="14576410">The Dutch Lane Elementary School, it cost them $198, still much larger, but not quite as large as the -- as the Mineola figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.161" offset="14616012">So, it simply shows that there is no padding and no excess and that applying the same bookkeeping methods fairly to both public and private schools shows or demonstrates the fact that there can be no overage and no excess.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.846" offset="14674735">As a matter of fact, all three Judges in the trial court agreed that there was no excess.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.043" offset="14699499">Judge Palmieri pointed it out very forcefully in his dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.767" offset="14710471">The other judges said that if you take out of account teacher exams, then there's very -- the -- the cost or -- then the reimbursement might, in some instances, exceed the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.348" offset="14772746">But the point is we maintain that the teacher exam should not be taken out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.673" offset="14786017">They're in the statute, they are specifically provided for in a regulation which my opponent has not even cited in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.295" offset="14820603">I see my time is running very short and I will close, Your Honor, with one further thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.728" offset="14838262">We've heard something about dilemmas today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.117" offset="14847875">Consider this dilemma.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.213" offset="14856234">The State has a right to have parochial schools perform effectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.644" offset="14881938">It has a right to have testing and examination done, not for the purpose of educating them, but for the purpose of seeing how well they are being educated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.407" offset="14933034">If it costs -- it admittedly costs schools a lot of money to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.898" offset="14958947">If relief of this sort is not allowed, another alternative, if it once comes up, may I just finish my sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.740" offset="14990294">A core of state inspectors, if it's all wrong to reimburse a school for doing this kind of work, it's obviously all right to send the core of inspectors in every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to keep attendance records, to give examinations, prior to the teacher from the room for the moment and give an examination and do all the bookkeeping work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.198" offset="15076185">That would require quite a few more people in Albany and would, I think, result in entanglement of a source of -- of a sort that has hardly been conceived.</text>
