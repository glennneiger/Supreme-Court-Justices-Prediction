            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We’ll hear arguments next in 72-5323, Keeble against the United States.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark V. Meierhenry</label>
            <text syncTime="25.521" offset="205406">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.898" offset="214915">This case comes to the Supreme Court from the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals which issued a split decision, affirming Judge Neckel of the District of South Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.224" offset="248247">The facts in this case are basically that this crime was committed upon an Indian reservation in the State of South Dakota, the Crow Creek Indian reservation, by one Indian against another Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.416" offset="293073">The indictment was brought under 18 U.S.C. 1153.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.201" offset="308224">There was a conviction had on this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.849" offset="318777">During the trial of the case, the defense requested the lesser included offense instruction, that was not given and the Supreme Court on December 4th of year past, granted certiorari on the question of whether the District Court’s refusal to give that lesser included defense instruction under 18 U.S.C. 1153 violated the Fifth Amendment due process guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.068" offset="419610">Now the lesser included defense instruction that was requested was the crime of assault to the major crime of assault with intent to do a great bodily injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.083" offset="463705">The defendant in this case has two basic contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.740" offset="474363">Number one, that the Act of 1885 intended that Indians be tried in the same manner and in the same courts as other persons committing the same crimes and the second is, that if the petitioner’s contention that this is incorrect and Congress did not intend the jurisdiction be present to convict under lesser included offense instructions, then 18 U.S.C. as applied, violates due process because a lesser included offense instruction is part of the fundamentally fair trial and Rule 31 (c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure so direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.348" offset="616782">Before I launch into the main argument, I would like to point out a correction as I see it in the government’s brief and that is argument 2, pages 19 to 23, and the petitioner’s view of that is not the state of the law at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.331" offset="672684">They speak in their brief of a narrow class of cases which would lead me to believe they think is 13 major crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.667" offset="698075">This is not the state of the law in Indian reservations in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.325" offset="712704">The general laws of the United States apply except and 18 U.S.C. 1152 points this out, “if the crime is one Indian against another Indian, if there has been punishment under tribal law and number three, if the treaty rights control this particular point and a case cited in the government’s brief points this out which is the Menominee Tribe versus United States which is a fishing right under treaty and which continues.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.765" offset="822418">Now an example of this is a case which is not cited in any brief, United States versus Berlin, 441 F.2d 1199 and this Court denied cert in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.836" offset="866722">That was forgery and what we are talking about here when I am talking about the general laws in the United States is that the Assimilative Crimes Act applies to Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.187" offset="904129">That case so held that, involved the conviction out of Montana for forgery under the state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.125" offset="927848">An example of this right now is the occurrences which are in news, the Wounded Knee.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.006" offset="947388">I have read the indictments against some of these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.660" offset="958046">It is under the Assimilative Crimes Act, it's for violations of postal regulations, involving postal things which the Wounded Knee Trading Post is also a post office, so the assimilated crimes act does apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.333" offset="1004753">Now the important thing about that in this case is under the Assimilative Crimes Act, an Indian would get a lesser included offense instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.493" offset="1041324">Only when you are talking about the 13 major crimes, does he not get a lesser included offense instruction, and as the government talks about this clear pattern, within the 13 there is one that there is a lesser included offense instruction, included within which is larceny and that would be the common thing of petty larceny, larceny under $100.00 which is included therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.171" offset="1128051">Now then the jurisdictional part as the Court is aware, started with Crow Dog which is in 1883 said that the United States government has no jurisdiction over crimes by one Indian against another Indian on an Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.353" offset="1188760">Out of that decision by the Supreme Court, the Act of March 3rd, 1885 set up the jurisdictional scheme that we now have on Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.888" offset="1226898">That said within a territory, which South Dakota was at that time, within a territory the laws of the territory applied to all persons, Indian and white alike, without any thought of an Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.501" offset="1277367">Therefore, between that dates 1885 and 1889 in the territory of Dakota, an Indian would get a lesser included offense instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.550" offset="1313520">Upon South Dakota becoming a state in 1889, Indians washed this right because the second part of the Act of 1885 took effect which said that within a state if it happened within the confines of an Indian reservation Federal Law applied, which of that kind there were seven major crimes defined by Federal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.100" offset="1399724">There are since been six added all defined by State Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.087" offset="1415711">Now within that reservation or within that four-year period, an Indian was given lesser included offense instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.908" offset="1442983">1889, the present scheme came up and ever since then all the courts have held and I’m the first to admit that the case law and the petitioner's side is minuscule.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.294" offset="1488541">No Court has allowed without being reversed lesser included offense instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.864" offset="1510797">However, the petitioner would point out that on page 10 of our brief the totality of two statutes now re-codified must be look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.510" offset="1549458">They are 18 U.S.C. 1153 and 18 U.S.C. 3242.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.623" offset="1573909">Mr. Meierhenry, let me go back just a minute in your argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.013" offset="1583417">You say that no court ever allowed it without being reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.518" offset="1597419">Does the government occasionally asked for a lesser included offense instruction as well as the defendant?</text>

            <text syncTime="379.907" offset="1623019">Close reading, in fact the government decided the case United States versus Jacobs, close reading of that case reveals that it was the government in that case that wished to have the lesser included offense instruction, as I remember it was Rape and Carnal knowledge or something of that matter, but they have in the past, yes.</text>

            <text syncTime="403.348" offset="1716746">Your Honor, I am if, the first point, if this Court should find that I am incorrect and there is no jurisdiction to give a lesser included offense instructions then it is the petitioner's contention that 18 U.S.C. 1153 as applied, meaning not giving a lesser included offense instruction, it violates due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.791" offset="1802533">So if the Court should rule against me on point one then I would contend that it violates the due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="438.826" offset="1858644">As far as the trial of this case, either way, if either point is correct, I believe it would have to be remanded because there was no lesser included offense instruction given.</text>

            <text syncTime="640.205" offset="2664155">They point out in their brief at page 23, they cite the recent case of McGinnis versus Royster, which was decided by this case on February 21, 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.437" offset="2709086">They cite language in their brief, but they don’t cite the start of the next paragraph which is the most important part of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.208" offset="2736253">“When classifications do not call for strict judicial certainty, this is certainly the only approach consistent with proper judicial regards for the judgment of legislative branch.”</text>
            <text syncTime="669.395" offset="2780975">My reading of this is that this Court did not deal that this case, the facts which involved good time under paroles and pardons, needed strict judicial scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.579" offset="2821726">All of the cases McLaughlin versus Florida and the rest talk about racial classifications as having that very strict judicial scrutiny and so the cases that they have cited here are not on point.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.872" offset="2866866">This Court in Weber versus Aetna Casualty, decided in 1972, has suggested a test, as a suggestive test that where you have personal rights which we’re contending that the right to a lesser include offense in this case does is a personal right, there’s a dual inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.616" offset="2941785">What legitimate interest does the classification promote, and what fundamental personal rights might the classification involve or endanger?</text>
            <text syncTime="719.027" offset="2979506">Now the Eighth Circuit below in its split opinion said that tribal sovereignty is the thing that must be protected, and I might point out that this time that this tribe, Crow Creek Tribe is not an Indian reorganization Act tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.277" offset="3036453">It operates under the code of Indian offenses which is found in CFR 11.1 and following is to my knowledge there are no tribal codes at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.838" offset="3078771">It’s all out of the code of federal regulations, so at least to the Crow Creek Tribe where this happened, the tribal sovereignty is questionable at least to decide this case on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.880" offset="3122866">But the fundamental personal rights that are endangered of Francis Keeble as an Indian person compared to other Indian citizens tried in federal court, it is his contention that he need not carry with him the tribe that tried as an individual in the courts of the United States, he should be tried as individual and they should be given all those protections, because if he is not given a lesser included offense instruction, Rule 31 (c) is violative of that statutory protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.353" offset="3236760">He also, as O’connor versus New Jersey pointed out in page 21 of our brief, he losses the right to have the jury decide the degree of crime as well as whether, the crime itself was committed and this to me involves the province of the jury that the jury is lost one element of deciding and they are the judges of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.146" offset="3324008">However, they are ruled by just those instructions given to them by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.194" offset="3340100">But there’s another thing it’s probably more important, and I found this in the trial of these type of cases as the petitioner has lost the fact that he can plea bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.345" offset="3380746">Now this Court in Santobello versus New York said that this is an essential component of the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.953" offset="3407182">Now he can certainly plea bargain in the sense of how many years and things like that, but what about the difference between a greater offense and a lesser offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.461" offset="3449187">This does not come in to play.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.179" offset="3460054">The government contends that this is a fair and rational classification yet three weeks ago in a case that I tried, there were two major crimes committed, larceny and burglary, because larceny is one of the original seven crimes and it is in the statute he got, this fellow got a lesser included offense instruction on larceny, but he didn’t on burglary because they said there’s no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.449" offset="3569142">Now here’s two felonies same occurrence on, one point he gets a lesser included offense instructions for which he was convicted and on the other one he doesn’t, he doesn’t get a lesser included offense instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.555" offset="3617625">The government would argue that the United States of America never intended for him to get one, yet they’ve been careful when they passed the Act back in 1885 to add that Indian persons were to be tried in the same manner as all other persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.950" offset="3699127">Now, the government further contends that this being a fair and rational classification is that only in effect 12 crimes that an Indian maybe charged with and should not get lesser included offense instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.394" offset="3768926">As I pointed out the Assimilative Crime Act, which is in effect the state law applied through the federal government, those apply on an Indian reservation unless those three things as I’ve mentioned 18 U.S.C. 52 excludes which is Indian against Indian which is if he is been punished by the local law, the tribe and if there is a specific treaty regulation on this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1008.452" offset="4137148">Number one applying the facts to this case, there is a case on this where the crime that they speak of is discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.785" offset="4166510">It’s Walks On Top versus the United States which is 372 F.2d 422.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.833" offset="4190751">In that case, the man assaulted was an Indian either Bureau of Indian Affairs or special officer or something, he was an Indian who was also an officer of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.151" offset="4227950">He was assaulted. He was charged under the general law, the Indian who assaulted the police officer, was charged under the general laws of the United States, assault upon a federal officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.269" offset="4276433">He was also given a lesser included offense instruction by the way, but the point out what they’re getting at is the federal connection, I assume.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.458" offset="4309243">Now, they’re saying that number one, there would be no lesser included offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.566" offset="4329618">Number one we have to assume and they don’t make this clear there wasn’t on an Indian reservation or of course their example is given is incorrect because then the Assimilative Crimes Act would apply, but there the connection is this, the federal connection is that he’s a federal officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.505" offset="4397432">In our case, the federal connection is that its territorial, it’s on land and that is the connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.065" offset="4423659">So the examples that they give is that it is not always in all or nothing situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.609" offset="4449782">The federal jurisdiction here we have to assume for their example, although they don’t make it clear it’s off of reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.211" offset="4472247">Otherwise, he would be given a lesser included offense instruction under this very factual situation that he talks about now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.159" offset="4500041">And on the bank robbers which is the other example that they put in their brief, again we’re assuming and they don’t make this clear that it’s not in on an Indian reservation, all we’re saying is that all bank robbers are treated the same and my case involves a situation where an Indian isn’t treated equally as all other persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.095" offset="4563780">If this were any non-Indian, he would’ve been given a lesser included offense instruction in our factual situation, in the case as bank robbery, all bank robberies are treated equally and if there is no jurisdiction for a lesser included offense instruction then all persons, no matter what race, they are treated equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.407" offset="4649044">And we must remember, I think that Francis Keeble is an Indian has no choice, Celestine versus the United States decided that which is decided as I recall on the last page of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.694" offset="4694183">At birth he can’t make an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.120" offset="4703901">He can’t say “I now wish to be tried as a White man and be a White man.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.748" offset="4722395">There are two cases, one says the white man born white can never be Indian, and an Indian person of Indian decent can never be treated as a White man under these acts, so that there is no choice left open.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard B. Stone</label>
            <text syncTime="1820.269" offset="7384482">Well that’s a complicated question Mr. Justice Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.489" offset="7393364">You may conceivably and I do think there’s any reason to get into this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.923" offset="7407052">You may have to be, not only prove that you have a drop of any blood but more than that and you may have to prove that you’ve got this, the right kind of drop of blood and you member of this particular tribe that resides on this reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.252" offset="7452400">But I think that those questions are much of the periphery of this particular inquiry which is quite important to focus on precisely what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.160" offset="7488031">As I say, this concept that Indian sovereignty is limited to some extent within certain broad boundaries by Congress’s power to redefine and narrow the scope of Indian tribal sovereignty through the passage of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.553" offset="7545605">Nonetheless, the Court has consistently recognized for hundreds of years that tribal sovereignty springs from independent roots that it retains a life and force of its own and that its residual effects can only be eliminated through very explicit Congressional action, and it was on this basis that the Court decided in Ex parte Crow Dog at 109 U.S. that the federal courts had no jurisdiction, absent a specific statute over the murder of an Indian by another Indian on the reservation because Congress had never withdrawn the exclusive jurisdiction of a such an offense from the sovereign tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.600" offset="7689801">And then again as recently as 1970 in the Kennelly case, the Court very strictly construed a federal statute, authorizing the tribes to see their civil jurisdiction over matters arising on the reservation and in short the Court has repeatedly emphasized that those aspects of tribal sovereignty of which Congress has not very explicitly withdrawn or still in full force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.818" offset="7786663">On the other hand, and this is where the particular difficulty in this case arises, since 1924 all Indians, including those residing on reservations subject to the jurisdiction of the tribal government and tribal courts had been considered United States citizens who enjoy the same privileges and rights conferred by that status which other United States citizens enjoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.010" offset="7875375">The inherent conflict between these two elements of Indians status is obvious enough to the extent that the tribal Indian remains subject to the governmental authority of the sovereign tribal group to which he belongs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.545" offset="7925530">He inevitably finds that merely because he is a tribal Indian, he enjoys certain privileges and incurs certain legal obligations which are not shared by other American citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.630" offset="7969938">One example of this which we have alluded to already in this argument and which seems to me crucially relevant to an understanding of the particular discrepancy with respect to which petitioner complains here, is it the tribal Indian who commits a crime against another Indian on the reservation is punishable exclusively in the tribal court, unless the crime is one of those with respect to which Congress has specifically delegated jurisdiction to the federal or state courts as for example in the Major Crimes Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.448" offset="8093132">Though Congress has repeatedly found, as I shall discuss shortly, that the preservation of the tribal court system is of great benefit to reservation Indians, subjection to the tribal court's jurisdiction, appears to have elements in some cases of both comparative advantage and comparative at least theoretical disadvantage to the tribal Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.460" offset="8189262">Aside for example from the comfort which he may derive for being judged by this tribal brothers in a proceeding that is meaningful and familiar to him and to his culture, the commentators appear to agree that he is likely to receive a considerably smaller penalty if he is convicted in the tribal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.913" offset="8251016">In this case for example the penalty which the tribal court imposed for the actions leading to the charge at issue here was 15 days incarceration essentially for public intoxication and a fine of $20.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.320" offset="8300648">On the other hand, the tribal court does not offer the panoply of procedural rights and protections which a non-Indian citizen would enjoy, if he were being tried for the same offense in a state or federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.692" offset="8350177">Indeed prior to 1968, Congress imposed virtually no requirements whatsoever on the tribal courts and with minor exceptions the federal courts held that because of the continued concept of tribal sovereignty, this discrepancy did not offend the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.489" offset="8409318">In 1968, as the Court knows, Congress passed the Indian Bill of Rights which imposed on the tribal courts at least a scalable version, the outlines of which had not yet been adjudicated of the rights enumerated in the first 10 amendments to the constitution, but that was presumably not by constitutional mandate, but part of Congress’s decision to slowly integrate the Indian tribal system into the concept of justice and inherent in rest of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.532" offset="8525511">Indeed, the Indian Bill of Rights, we would suggest is representative of a pattern that has been very wisely followed in the reconciliation of the conflicting elements of the Indian status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.986" offset="8571277">A few Federal Court of Appeals in years immediately prior to the passage of that act had indicated some impatience with the slow movement of tribal courts in the direction of affording traditional constitutional protections to criminal defendants and it had been suggested in at least one case that a proceeding in a tribal court might be reviewable in the federal courts on the ground that the tribal court was obligated to provide at least some constitutional procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.859" offset="8670856">It’s rather awkward doctrine for a court to be applying because it applies a piecemeal with no ascertainable standard constitutional protections rather than applying it across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.581" offset="8717667">But it was recognized even in that case that Congress is the appropriate body and is in a lesser awkward and more appropriate decision to determine the details of the plan by which tribal justice can be integrated into the American Constitutional system in a manner that preserves to the extent Congress deems desirable both to sovereign rights of the tribal government and the rights owed to Indians as citizens of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.474" offset="8817246">And so Congress has repeatedly responded in all areas related to this case not with a mechanical across the board application of constitutional requirements on the tribal court system, but with the set of requirements which the Congress considers viable in terms of preserving the basic nature of those courts. Now, this case presents this Court with another closely related aspect of the problem of reconciling the status of Indians as citizens and their status as members of a separate sovereignty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2260.466" offset="9145240">It hasn’t been raised before and it is been accepted in this case and in other cases that these two offenses are sufficiently related so that the Major Crimes Act confers the jurisdiction under the South Dakota law to try for assault with intent to commit the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.765" offset="9206471">I have two answers in mitigation of the very obvious objection that there may be an element required in the Major Crimes Act which is not required under South Dakota law to with their element of actual serious bodily damage and that would be the objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.359" offset="9268851">First of all, it is not at all clear that the offense in South Dakota of assault with intent to inflict great bodily harm is prosecuted in practice unless there is in fact a great bodily harm, and the other answer to that is in this case it is entirely undisputed on the record and I do not believe petitioner would dispute that the actual incident here resulted in great bodily harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.652" offset="9377938">I doubt that the federal government would have prosecuted had it not resulted in great bodily harm and I simply believe the theoretical possibility of a case in which there was no great bodily harm but perhaps a proof that there was an intent on successfully carried out to cause great bodily harm as an open question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2839.252" offset="11460420">As I say, this case presents the Court with an isolated aspect of the problem of reconciling the status of Indians as citizens and as members of separate sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.841" offset="11506709">The problem arises because Congress has determined that a tribal Indian who commits certain major crimes against another Indian on a reservation is tried in the same manner subject to the same penalty as a non-Indian committing the identical offense and yet on the other hand, Congress has determined that with respect to all other crimes not listed in the Major Crimes Act, a tribal Indian remains subject exclusively to the jurisdiction of the tribal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.667" offset="11606079">Even though admittedly his non-Indian fellow citizen who commits the identical offense in the same place goes through a very different procedure and is subject to the very different law applicable in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.941" offset="11651114">I take that petitioner would not deny the accuracy of his description.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.992" offset="11663339">He is already confirmed it, nor would he question, he does not appear to question of the constitutionality of the overall jurisdictional scheme even though it creates a significant procedural and substantive discrepancy between tribal Indians and other persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.992" offset="11719346">Indeed, the overall scheme has been confirmed too many times by this Court to lend credence to an answer that mere categorization of an Indian in a federal statute is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.916" offset="11775039">Rather he attacks one very specific aspect of this discrepancy which results inevitably from the Congressional allocation of jurisdiction between the federal and tribal courts in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.823" offset="11818715">Simply stated, if an Indian is on trial in the federal court for one of the offenses enumerated in the Major Crimes Act, neither her nor the government is entitled to ask the court for a lesser included offense charge even if otherwise appropriate, unless the lesser included offense happens to be one of the other offenses specifically enumerated in the Major Crimes Act because the federal court has no jurisdiction to try and punish an Indian for commissions of any offense not specifically enumerated in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.279" offset="11928534">And with respect to a non-Indian with the same situation, of course, it may be appropriate and probably would have been appropriate here to instruct the jury that if it finds him innocent of the major offense charged, it may still find him guilty of a lesser included offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.682" offset="11986108">Now, there are essentially two arguments raised. One, petitioner argues that alternatively that the Major Crimes Act itself allows the lesser included offense charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.247" offset="12036368">I think that with my time running short, I shall leave that statutory argument essentially to the brief in which we answer it fully.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.506" offset="12065416">Basically, it seems to me it is somewhat unusual for the government to be in the position of arguing a strict construction in non-presence of a federal crime against a criminal defendant who argues that something is a federal crime, but we have I think tried our best to bind ourselves by the very strict rule of statutory construction applicable in a criminal context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.447" offset="12145142">Generally, the crimes ought not to be construed and that a federal crime should not be read by implication into a very specifically worded statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.398" offset="12177011">I think that that presumption applies with double force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.347" offset="12188714">In this context where Congress has specifically and repeatedly said that the jurisdiction of the tribal sovereignty can be only be eliminated by very specific Congressional mandate and indeed Congress has tiptoed step by step by step in amending the Major Crimes Act to include offenses on a very carefully considered basis and it would be highly contrary to the history of that act and its amendments to conclude that any crime is created by mere implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.707" offset="12310235">So I would, with the Court’s permission like to focus on the constitutional problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="3131.649" offset="12629974">With respect to each Congress felt that it was -- the crimes were so major that the interest in severe enough punishment, the assurance of severe punishment of those major crimes was sufficient to withdraw jurisdiction or to withdraw exclusive jurisdiction from the tribal courts for any of those offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.895" offset="12690996">But with respect to all other crimes, it is quite clear from the history of the Act that Congress very much intended that for the same reasons that it always left these to the tribal courts, they were to be left at this point to the tribal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.594" offset="12741778">Therefore, in suggesting that this issue should be considered in the context of the entire statutory scheme by which Congress has attempted to reconcile the conflicting elements of tribal Indian status, a scheme which quite explicitly results in some situations in disparate legal treatment of persons merely on the ground that they are not Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.738" offset="12834356">We think that the rationale is that of the entire scheme essentially governing the tribal court system and the allocation of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.196" offset="12864136">This is one minor example of it but the entire scheme is a preservation of the sovereignty of tribal courts at least with respect to offenses not enumerated in the Major Crimes Act between and against -- by and against Indians committed on reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.637" offset="12925889">And Congress as including in its passage of the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968, the Indian Bill of Rights in 1968, Congress has studied carefully this question and has concluded that the preservation of the tribal court system is essentially of great benefit to Indians that field studies and commentators have shown that many Indians feel that they get a more a fair and more equitable treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3292.206" offset="13272168">(A) it is in any context, very speculative from the defendant’s point of view whether a lesser included offense charge is beneficial to him, Theoretically, it’s only a benefit if the jury doesn’t follow its instructions and it maybe perfectly proper for the jury to administer mercy in some sorts of situations, particularly where there are a marginal, where the evidence is marginal which we don’t think it was in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.491" offset="13373315">The evidence was overwhelming that the requisite intent and the requisite amount of damage occurred, but it is any event a rather speculative benefit from the defendant’s point of view any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.127" offset="13411871">The lesser included offense charge arose because the prosecutor might be barred by double jeopardy from bringing lesser included -- entirely included offenses in successive prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.275" offset="13460459">And it was to enable him to put the lesser included offense before the jury so that there would be some sort of conviction if the jury acquitted him of that major offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.032" offset="13495463">Now, we don’t argue that it’s not available and that in some cases, it would be reversible error to deny it to a criminal litigant, but the question is in a constitutional context, in an equal protection argument, we must ask how important in interest is it, and I think it is a very speculative interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.400" offset="13560978">Particularly in this context, where as Judge Kaufman suggested in the Second Circuit in a related case involving a split between adult and juvenile jurisdiction, where a lesser included offense charge was not available to a juvenile who could be convicted of murder in an adult court, but a man slaughter only on a juvenile proceeding, Judge Kaufman suggested something that would’ve been perfectly applicable here though it wasn’t asked for, and that could be the functional equivalent of a lesser included offense charge and that is a charge to the effect that even if you, the jury in this federal proceeding, acquit this Indian of the charge with which he is -- which is brought against in here, he is not necessarily going to go free from the occurrences in this transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3551.726" offset="14310275">I would like to get back for one second to Mr. Justice Brennan’s question and to say why I don’t think the issue of double jeopardy, the Barkus, where this Court has to necessarily decide that for all purposes, Indian and federal jurisdiction are separate sovereignties, though indeed we believe they are because in the context of this case that question is really only important to the issue whether it is true that if acquitted on the major charge in this case, this defendant could be then to retried on a lesser included charge in the tribal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.936" offset="14435140">And I would argue that even if they are not separate sovereignties for all purposes with respect to that question, the answer would be that double jeopardy is inapplicable because that particular branch of the double jeopardy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.964" offset="14483205">As opposed say from the collateral estoppel problem or from the problem of double punishment for two convictions for the same offense, is based on the assumption that a prosecutor ought not to be allowed to go down the line in piecemeal harassment -- harassing fashion, and it is designed to prevent him from abusing his discretion to go down the line and continue to punish or try to punish for each successive crimes and that’s inapplicable here because he has no jurisdiction to go down the line.</text>

            <text syncTime="3638.010" offset="14655404">In conclusion, I would simply reiterate that this case must be viewed I think as one isolated and not be terribly significant aspect of discrepancies which inevitably arise from this very, very complex effort to accommodate the conflicting in differing elements of Indian status that the result of declaring this particular discrepancy unconstitutional would be very short sighted and unwise from this Court’s point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.820" offset="14774627">It would be either at the very least, it would force Congress -- force upon Congress this Court’s judgment that a rationale which has been repeatedly upheld by the federal courts and repeatedly considered, studied and re-endorsed by Congress to preserve the sovereignty of Indian tribal courts where Congress deems it applicable is in sufficient to offset discrepancy with respect to what is really a very speculative disadvantage that an Indian may, and particularly an Indian in a particular case may with hindsight think he has suffered and I would recommend that the Court affirm this decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="3713.531" offset="14957484">Your Honor, it’s unfortunate that the petitioner’s taken the case this far and the United States government has still not gotten all of its forces together and decided between what’s going on in Washington and what’s going on in South Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.525" offset="15001475">There is no such thing as a tribal Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.784" offset="15014536">If a man of Indian descent is born and raised in Washington, D.C. at age 28, goes on a vacation to the Black Hills, passes through the reservation, commits one of the 13 major crimes, he will not be given a lesser included offense instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.615" offset="15073782">That well, when the 12 major crime because if he steals something, and its larceny, he will. Now, that’s a rational classification according to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.348" offset="15108786">The government says, “Don’t anyone step in here because this has all been thought out” yet the particular crime might have got up here, Congress forget to even amend 3242 which they did the other 12 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.363" offset="15156851">I submit that Congress has gone at this since 1885 at a happenstance manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.202" offset="15180152">They have never once, as this Court knows had this issue brought to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.707" offset="15194154">They have added crime one at a time, but they’ve never considered this is a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.624" offset="15213902">Now another thing that the government brings up is that let’s be strict about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.757" offset="15238353">The fact and I will say that I did not raise the issue about the discrepancy of the statutory language in the Major Crimes Act and what he was charged with the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.701" offset="15278164">I did not raise that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.471" offset="15285269">And at this point, I don’t think I can properly do so, but I’ll tell you why the government uses that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.962" offset="15307212">South Dakota has a statute in the assault section about four after this one, that is almost exactly like the federal one, it’s called beating assault by beating, wounding and kicking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.537" offset="15349530">The reason they don’t use it is it's got a six month penalty and they want five years, and that’s why they don’t use it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3918.472" offset="15777311">Additionally the fact that I could ask a separate sovereign, that I can ask for an instruction to the jury that would say in effect, “If you don’t convict him, he can go back to tribal court.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3962.665" offset="15954004">And on this matter, his view was that it was strictly jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3968.246" offset="15976364">In our circuit, I don’t know if it’s proper to express this, but I’m sure and the government as a matter of fact in their briefs says “Don’t give us his power because we may abuse it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.674" offset="16018056">But the petitioner and defense lawyers in our State wish very much that they have it, because this gives us more latitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="3986.878" offset="16050866">It feel -- we feel now that many cases you have to take the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.473" offset="16069256">You plea the man of a felony that you don’t feel convicted of, and by the way the grand jury of course is the buffer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.060" offset="16095587">And the facts in this case, the man was originally charged with manslaughter because I didn’t know to do, I demanded a preliminary hearing and got one surprisingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4006.829" offset="16130696">He was bound over on manslaughter.</text>

            <text syncTime="4010.908" offset="16146996">The grand jury returned an assault with intent and so forth to do great bodily injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.265" offset="16172387">So there is a buffer there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4018.407" offset="16176985">There’s no danger in my opinion if the grand jury system works and a defense lawyer doesn’t know what goes on that there’ll be this thing of the prosecutor doubling up, charging a greater crime hoping to get a conviction on the minor because most misdemeanors are, you know, a six-month variety and the tribal court has that jurisdiction, or CFR does in this case.</text>
