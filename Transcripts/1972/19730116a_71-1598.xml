            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We’ll hear arguments next in number 71-1598 Hudson against Arnheim.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.604" offset="233827">Mr. Frey, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="35.294" offset="244590">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.488" offset="257337">This case is here on writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit holding an elevator operators, cleaning ladies, and other operating maintenance and personnel at eight office buildings and one apartment complex in the Pittsburgh area, managed by respondent Arnheim and Neely, are not entitled to the protection of the Fair Labor Standards Act’ minimum wage and overtime provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.803" offset="362559">The decision below conflicts with the decision of the Fourth Circuit involving identical issues and holding that the employees were covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.757" offset="398399">Arnheim is a real estate firm engaged among other activities in the management of office buildings and apartment houses as agents for the owners of such buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.603" offset="437791">At the time this suit was brought, it managed a total of nine such buildings for various unrelated owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.782" offset="466526">Arnheim’s management activities are carried out under basically identical contracts with each of the building owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.247" offset="492335">Under which Arnheim assumes all of the functions of managing and operating the buildings including the procurement of tenants and negotiation and enforcement of leases, the collection of rents, arrangement for utilities and other services, in short all aspects of the operation of the buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.385" offset="568926">Now Arnheim’s business is conducted from its central office and managed by supervisory management personnel operating out of that central office.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.725" offset="614275">With respect to each building, Arnheim collects the rents, deposits them in separate bank accounts and uses the funds to pay the operating expenses of the buildings to pay its commissions and to remit the balance to the owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.744" offset="674356">Now, Arnheim has extensive responsibilities in connection with personnel employed at the various buildings and I am talking about such personnel as elevator operators, cleaning ladies, watchmen, building engineers and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.492" offset="729318">Functions and responsibilities of Arnheim with respect to these personnel are spelled out in detail in the stipulation that was filed in the District Court and that’s in the appendix and also at pages 5 and 6 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.282" offset="776547">Now briefly summarized, these functions involved hiring, promotion, and firing of all personnel; supervision of their performance of their employment, making work assignments and scheduling the time of work, negotiating union contracts, determining rates of pay and benefits, preparing payroll and maintenance of other employee records and payment of salaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.701" offset="870170">In short, every conceivable incident of the employer-employee relationship is encompassed in Arnheim’s responsibility, although the owners are consulted and enjoy of veto with respect to certain matters such as the rates of pay and promotions.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="209.633" offset="941955">I don’t believe that in this -- that the record reflects that they are shifted.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.846" offset="958777">They are employed for a particular building.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="220.717" offset="986258">Well, I would say that it is a relationship of employer and employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.632" offset="1005902">Our position is and I think this Court has clearly held certainly in the context of the Fair Labor Standards Act that in determining the employer-employee relationship, you don’t look solely at the common law concepts and you don’t -- and in any event even if you did the right to hire, the right to fire even if it is a shared responsibility with another person gives you a status as an employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="292.829" offset="1274650">Our position would be that Arnheim would be responsible for payment of minimum wages then Arnheim is under the act of employer in that sense. And it has every power that an employer has.</text>

            <text syncTime="321.581" offset="1389693">I don’t think that that’s essential for the disposition of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="326.746" offset="1410382">Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, their responsibility to pay the light bill would be a matter of state law and of contract between them and the building owner but here we have a special situation which is that they do serve as employers of these people under the Act and if these people are entitled to the acts protection, then the employer is reliable to see that they get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.006" offset="1491362">And as both Arnheim in this case and the building owners and I will expand on this shortly.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="352.221" offset="1512260">Mr. Frey, am I correct in my impression the Third Circuit decided the employer issue in the Government’s favor?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="358.874" stopTime="359.925">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="358.874" offset="1538905">That’s correct Your Honor.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="359.925" stopTime="361.761">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="361.761" stopTime="891.784">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="361.761" offset="1550399">That’s correct Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.450" offset="1561161">Again later on, I think I will indicate that there is an argument that’s made that this is somehow still relevant to the enterprise question which is really before the Court today but we think that argument is fallacious.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.638" offset="1613928">Now, the Secretary of Labor brought suit in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania to compel Arnheim and Neely, to comply with the minimum wage, the overtime and the record-keeping provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.160" offset="1663979">Arnheim raised basically four defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.387" offset="1672965">First, it contended that it was not the employer of these employees that the building owner was.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.544" offset="1693550">The District Court rejected that contention, it looks both that the relationship in Arnheim actually had to these employees and to the definition in the Act on how that it was an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.612" offset="1737853">Secondly, Arnheim contended that that in determining whether the dollar volume requirements of the Act are met, the Court should consider only Arnheim’s commissions and not the gross rents from the buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.231" offset="1784247">This argument too was rejected by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.615" offset="1797831">Thirdly and this is the key issue in this case today, Arnheim contended that its business was not an enterprise under the Act but rather that the employees at these buildings were employed and its many different enterprises as there were separate building owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.434" offset="1861151">Finally, an issue that is not raised by either side here, there was an issue regarding the nexus to interstate commerce and the District Court held that prior to February 1, 1967, the necessary nexus did not exist and dismissed the secretary suit as to that prior period subsequent to February 1, 1967 when the statute was amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.017" offset="1951431">The Court held that the necessary nexus did exist and we don’t understand that issue to be contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.758" offset="1978389">On appeal, the Third Circuit held an agreement with the Government’s position on the District Court that Arnheim is an employer of these employees under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.924" offset="2019035">It secondly held also an agreement with the Government and with the District Court that the proper measure of gross revenues for purposes of determining coverage under Section 3 (s) of the Act is rents and not merely Arnheim’s commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.921" offset="2075042">However, they agreed with Arnheim that it was not conducting a single enterprise but rather as many different enterprises as they were different building owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.856" offset="2114748">Accordingly, it remanded the case to the District Court for a hearing whether each of these, whether any of these separate enterprises met the dollar volume requirements of the Act to create an enterprise in which the employees would be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.283" offset="2172531">Our petition for certiorari raised solely the issue of the correctness of the Court of Appeals definition of Arnheim’s enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.720" offset="2202206">No cross-petition was filed with respect to the issues won by the Government below nor were they raise in the brief in our position to the certiorari petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.148" offset="2247973">Turning to the merits, the Government’s theory is that these employees are employed in Arnheim and Neely’s Enterprise, the management of office and apartment buildings for others and that the activities that all the buildings Arnheim manages are part of a single enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.811" offset="2314637">Question presented to this Court is fundamentally one of interpretation of the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.450" offset="2341177">We submit these provisions are acceptable of only one interpretation and that interpretation provides coverage for these employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.876" offset="2374928">Let’s take John Doe, an elevator operator of one of the buildings that Arnheim manages, in order to determine whether he is protected by the minimum wage provisions which it contained in Section 6 of the Act would begin by looking at Section 6 which says every employer shall pay to each of his employees and I am skipping to the relevant part, employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce wages at certain rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.415" offset="2489031">Now the phrase “engaged in the --employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce or the production of goods for commerce” is defined in Section 3 (s).</text>
            <text syncTime="605.349" offset="2524766">Its there defined as an enterprise whose annual gross volume of sales made or business done is not less than $500,000 if we are talking about the period from February 1967 to January 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.373" offset="2584848">So the question is, is John Doe employed in an enterprise which has the necessary dollar volumes?</text>
            <text syncTime="627.684" offset="2614105">Now “enterprise” as defined in Section 3 (r) and here we are the crux of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.920" offset="2635003">The relevant portion says that an enterprise means “the related activities performed either through unified operation or common control by any person or persons for a common business purpose, and includes all such activities whether performed in one or more establishments or by one or more corporate or other organizational units.”</text>
            <text syncTime="657.141" offset="2731969">Now Arnheim’s activities as a manager of office and apartment buildings for others clearly constitute a single enterprise under this definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.092" offset="2767705">There are three elements that need to be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.515" offset="2777422">Are they related activities?</text>
            <text syncTime="670.919" offset="2787035">And Congress has not defined related activities per se but the legislative history makes it clear that consider related activities to be those that are the same or similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.583" offset="2829667">Looking in Arnheim’s activities that each of the office buildings and apartment buildings that have manages, it does the same thing under basically the same agreement with the building owner clearly related activities we submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.329" offset="2880658">The second requirement is, are these activities performed through a unified operation or common control?</text>
            <text syncTime="700.244" offset="2904377">Now, the common control requirement is satisfied if they’re performed by a single company.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.677" offset="2922036">Arnheim and Neely incorporated runs the business of Arnheim and Neely, Incorporated and that’s what we are talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.344" offset="2948786">The common control requirement is met.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.993" offset="2959339">In addition, although it’s not necessary to meet both, Arnheim’s business of managing buildings is run through unified operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.977" offset="2991313">That is out of its central Arnheim and Neely office where its management and supervisory personnel and clerical personnel work.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.410" offset="3025063">Finally, these related activities must be engaged in, for a common business purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.997" offset="3051395">Again, we think it’s clear that the requirement is met.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.527" offset="3061530">The emphasis of Congress was on the word “business” to distinguish between business and charitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.941" offset="3083160">Here, the activities that each of the nine buildings are undertaken by Arnheim for its business purpose of managing buildings and making a profit from that activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.933" offset="3135091">How then did the Court of Appeals reach a different conclusion?</text>
            <text syncTime="761.608" offset="3149824">It did so by completely ignoring Arnheim’s enterprise and by looking instead at Arnheim’s clients the building owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.694" offset="3178141">It found that the building owners did not share common business purpose that they have nine distinct enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.996" offset="3207398">This finding was absolutely correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.243" offset="3216384">We have no problem with it, whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.850" offset="3226728">But it’s irrelevant as applied to this case because it’s Arnheim’s enterprise in which we contend that these individuals are employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.165" offset="3264031">Now, there is a fact which is perhaps overlooked by the Court of Appeals and by the respondents herein which is that under the Fair Labor Standards Act, it’s possible to be employed in more than one enterprise at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.616" offset="3313873">And indeed that’s exactly what appears to have happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.303" offset="3332577">These persons are employed in the building owners enterprise which is to own real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.141" offset="3355982">They are employed in Arnheim and Neely’s enterprise which is to manage real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.815" offset="3374582">They are involved in both of those businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.409" offset="3385031">Now, where they are employed by more than one enterprise, if one of the enterprises comes within the coverage requirements of Section 3 (s) then the employee is protected regardless of whether the other enterprise by which he may also be employed comes within Section 3 (s) or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.988" offset="3455352">Now, I think the example that we gave in our reply brief of the warehouses retaining the protective agency will illustrate the fallacy of the reasoning of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.416" offset="3497044">Supposed you have nine separate warehouses, each completely independent business having no connection with one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.129" offset="3523897">They all require security services, night watchmen, they all retain the same protection agency and the issue is, are these night watchmen entitled to the protection of the Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="866.660" offset="3569977">Now of course if you look at the enterprises of the warehouses in which they may be employed, their station let us say at the same warehouse every night that they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.634" offset="3605922">You might say “well, the warehouse doesn’t have an enterprise that fits the statutory requirement, therefore they are not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.680" offset="3634134">But of course they are also employed in the protection agencies enterprise which is to provide night watchmen and various warehouses and other business as there in the city.</text>

            <text syncTime="919.565" offset="3781674">The question is “are you employed in an enterprise?” which comes within the definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.515" offset="3805393">Now, how could one say that these elevator operators are not employed in Arnheim’s enterprise?</text>
            <text syncTime="931.831" offset="3830680">Arnheim’s enterprise is to operate buildings and these -- without the elevator operators, Arnheim couldn’t conduct its business in managing these buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.351" offset="3876760">And therefore these men are employed in Arnheim’s enterprise and it doesn’t matter whose employees they are.</text>

            <text syncTime="995.467" offset="4085217">Well, one of the cases cited by the respondents or perhaps by the amicus, I think it’s the Royal Crown case involves the situation where the president of a company was held personally liable under the Act because of the extent of his involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.038" offset="4159509">But here, I don’t think that’s the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.024" offset="4167450">The plant manager would not be considered to have an enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.472" offset="4185213">We are talking about whose enterprise to these people working.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.804" offset="4202559">Are they working in an enterprise which is covered under the Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.568" offset="4221680">Now, it would be possible that they could work in an enterprise and the operator of that enterprise would not be liable for their wages and the example of that would be the beauty salon operating as leasing space in a department store.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.361" offset="4292838">Now, the employees of that beauty salon, if the department store’s enterprise qualified under the Act, the revenues of the beauty salon would be included within the department stores enterprise to determine whether it was subject to the Act and the employees in the beauty salon would be entitled to the protection of the at even though the department store exercise, no control whatsoever over them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.578" offset="4393671">The department store might have no liability to pay the minimum wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.054" offset="4407568">The beauty salon operator who does not have an enterprise with $500,000 would be liable to pay because these persons are employed in an enterprise which meets the Acts requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.300" offset="4460544">And this is a very important point that that is overlooked in the briefs of the respondents in the amicus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.022" offset="4503489">Now, I think I was just getting to this point actually and I think perhaps I’ve adequately covered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.027" offset="4551450">So, in closing, let me say this, it seems clear that the underpinnings of the Third Circuits decision was a concern for the impact of the minimum wage laws on the business of the building owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.098" offset="4607770">Now, it is of course an inevitable feature of such laws that they raise the cost of certain goods and services and thereby adversely affect the consumers of those goods and services, many of whom maybe small businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.646" offset="4662000">This is never in the past in anyway discouraged Congress from adopting and from expending the coverage of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Any event, the concern of the Court of Appeals for these building owners seems to us misplaced in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.221" offset="4720306">It’s by retaining a firm such as Arnheim and Neely to manage its buildings but the building owners realize important benefits of an economic nature for themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.425" offset="4761057">These benefits derive from the skill of Arnheim’s operation from the fact that it manages many buildings that it is able to hire for instance experienced top management personnel to manage office buildings which wouldn’t be justified if only a single office building were being managed so that substantial benefits are being conferred upon the building owners when they retain Arnheim and this notion that if they have to pay the minimum wages, they will all stop retaining Real Estate Management firms is totally without foundation in the record and we believe contrary to normal experience.</text>

            <text syncTime="1383.784" offset="5638457">They could be joint employers and I think it’s very important that in this case, the agreement between Arnheim and the building owner could be setup in such a way that Arnheim would not be liable under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.892" offset="5694986">Arnheim can simply get out of the business of running these buildings with these personnel and leave that to the building owner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1422.962" offset="5795192">By that same token, the building owners can get out of liability under the Act by withdrawing any of their employment control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.207" offset="5836152">That is, they could leave it up to Arnheim to pay whatever salary Arnheim wants and just reimburse Arnheim on a cost plus basis for doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.928" offset="5871052">And such a case which would be irrelatively minor change in the existing agreement, the building owners would be off to hook as far as liability for payment of minimum wages and for making sure that the necessary records are kept and so on, that would all be Arnheim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.765" offset="5926431">In this case, they have chosen to setup their relationship in a manner that makes them both liable because they are both -- because these persons are employed in both of their enterprises and they are both employers under the definition of the Act which both courts below have held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.055" offset="5995604">Now, I think when we are talking about the policy that informs and underlies the Fair Labor Standards Act, there are numerous references in the legislative history to this policy and I want to refer to one in the House Report in connection with the 1966 Amendments to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.514" offset="6081390">The Committee said, in keeping with the broad statutory definitions of the “coverage” phrase is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.905" offset="6103019">The courts have repeatedly expressed and adhere to the principle that the coverage phrases should receive a liberal interpretation consonant with the definitions with the purposes of the Act and with its character as remedial and humanitarian legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.945" offset="6163101">However, despite the Acts broad coverage terms and the court’s liberal interpretations regarding coverage and restrictive interpretations regarding exemptions, there is great need for extending the present coverage of the Act to large groups of workers whose earnings today are unjustifiably and disproportionably low.</text>

            <text syncTime="1567.274" offset="6372498">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.236" offset="6388276">I first would like to answer the Court’s question respect to who owns the bank accounts involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.546" offset="6421608">On the bottom of page 23 of the stipulation, it says specifically the funds deposited in these accounts for the property of the owner and not of Arnheim and Neely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.254" offset="6460374">And Arnheim and Neely is not liable in the event of bankruptcy or failure of the depositor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.262" offset="6480436">There’s no question, Your Honors, that these are agency accounts and that Arnheim and Neely would not be liable for any of the wages personally if these buildings could not meet the payroll itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.542" offset="6529546">Now, this history of this case started in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.320" offset="6548668">At which time, one of the Labor Department representatives came in to Arnheim and Neely’s quarters to examine the operation, decided that Arnheim and Neely was an enterprise and we have been on the road ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.173" offset="6604048">When we reach the litigation stage in 1967, we knew that we were guinea pig and that we were the first to be hit with the suit by an agent who had no ownership in any of the buildings which it managed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.963" offset="6675205">Because of the importance to the industry, the instituted Real Estate Management asked to leave to intervene as a party defendant and was given that permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.249" offset="6716374">We lost the first trial in the Federal Court in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.640" offset="6729958">Shortly after our case came down, a similar case was started by the Federal Government in the District Court of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.416" offset="6765066">And despite the holding against us, the District Court of Virginia decided in favor of the real estate managing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.167" offset="6804041">In that case, they made a threshold question as to whether or not the measure should be gross receipts or gross commissions and they held it should be gross commissions because the real estate manager didn’t own any of the gross receipts themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.846" offset="6850748">So we went into the Circuit Court in the Third Circuit feeling pretty good that the -- at least we had one case in our favor namely the Virginia case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1703.077" offset="6915636">Prior to the argument in the Third Circuit, the Fourth Circuit got ahead of use and decided and reversed the lower court in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.671" offset="6954088">So then the Government came in to the argument and said we got a pretty good case also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.538" offset="6977494">Despite the Fourth Circuit case and the lower court case in its own district, the Third Circuit decided that Arnheim and Neely was not an enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.028" offset="7027440">In a very well-reasoned opinion, concise, logical and I may be a little prejudice but I still say it’s that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.384" offset="7056906">I don’t have to go in to detail as to the nature of Arnheim and Neely’s activities, it’s already been discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.661" offset="7086059">There are many unusual type of activities than usual type of management activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.077" offset="7103718">But there is one point, Your Honors that I have to make clear and emphasize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.445" offset="7121168">Arnheim and Neely does not own any of the buildings in which it manages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.858" offset="7138826">They are just no ownership present, that’s all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.334" offset="7148753">Every case of enterprise must have some type of ownership going with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.309" offset="7164635">And they don’t have any ownership here.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eugene B. Strassburger, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1822.062" offset="7391587">I am talking about title to the receipts which they receive for example, the gross rentals that they receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.641" offset="7417919">Well, let me continue and I think I will be able to explain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.588" offset="7437772">This Court decided back in 1945, the case of 10 East 40th Street building versus Callus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.803" offset="7462536">That case involved a local building operation and because of that decision, the Court held that the employees were not within the interstate commerce rule and it was a part -- simply a local operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.042" offset="7535574">Now, we have here nine separate buildings, all of which can be considered to be Callus cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.614" offset="7557831">The Government says, well since that case, we have gone into the enterprise doctrine and therefore that case doesn’t hold right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.515" offset="7593462">Of course the case is still being cited everyday for the proposition for which it stands and the crux of the real issue here is, does the enterprise doctrine nullified the holding of the Callus case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.775" offset="7662425">So we are back again to the definition situation as to what is an enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.397" offset="7680920">And Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Stewart deplored the exercise in semantics in the Maryland versus Wirtz case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.024" offset="7707460">We are going to have to do a little exercise in semantics, nevertheless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.739" offset="7730343">The definition states related activities performed either through unified operation or common control by any person or persons for a common business purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.678" offset="7782066">The word “common” appears in this definition twice in three lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.568" offset="7797635">So, I must assume that the word is rather important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.485" offset="7817279">But let’s take each of the definition words as it goes down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.502" offset="7837341">First, it says related.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.015" offset="7847476">What are related activities?</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.243" offset="7852387">Well, the Government would have us believe that they are the internal activities of Arnheim and Neely which are related.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.437" offset="7877151">Well, of course any building has internal activities which are related to each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.043" offset="7899512">This is not what the Congress meant Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.650" offset="7909961">The related activities are those which concern more than one business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.278" offset="7924485">Not just Arnheim and Neely business but more than one business with common ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.217" offset="7944234">Lacking the common ownership, there can be no related activity, unified operation or common control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.062" offset="7971610">Well, I could only refer to those activities where there is more than one business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.030" offset="7987493">Naturally, a single business has unified operation in common control and not as the Government contends to a single operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.873" offset="8022915">As a matter of fact, common control may not even be enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.725" offset="8034304">A recent case in the Tenth Circuit decided since out case called University Club Tower case involved a situation where one corporation controlled both an apartment building and a hotel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.351" offset="8088743">And the Court said, well the business purpose of a hotel is not the same as the business purpose of a apartment building, therefore, no enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.382" offset="8124897">So, I submit to you Honors, if a hotel and an apartment building which are commonly owned and controlled are not an enterprise, how can there be an enterprise where you have a number of unrelated buildings merely because they have a common agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.446" offset="8189158">The use of the work “common” as I said before is a very important phrase -- word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.751" offset="8210369">When you talk about “common,” you talk about more than one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.218" offset="8228237">Even the definition of common in the dictionary says, belonging to, or equally shared by two or more individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.712" offset="8262196">Well now, I know that Learned Hand once said, “We are not going to make forth recite a dictionary and I’m not saying that we should in this case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.904" offset="8295006">But nevertheless, this Court had talking to Mr. Justice Vinson once said, “We have consistently refused to pervert the process of interpretation by mechanically applying definitions in unattended context refused to pervert.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.777" offset="8358431">Those are strong words in those days but they have a different connotations today and I am not going to accuse the Government of any type of perversion but they are certainly are distorting the words of this definition of enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.981" offset="8407333">“Common,” if I use my driveway with my wife and family, if I created a common driveway?</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.525" offset="8433455">Of course not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.955" offset="8439202">But if I use my driveway with somebody on the other side who has got a property on the other side, then I have created something in common.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.016" offset="8467414">The Government, however says because Arnheim and Neely is operating more than one building, it is in common.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.585" offset="8501687">It’s operating with itself and I say that this thus doesn’t mean anything as far as definition at large is concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.093" offset="8531780">Now, I’ve taken the definition apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.426" offset="8537109">Let’s put it back together again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.042" offset="8547558">What is an enterprise?</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.636" offset="8553932">Well, I think an enterprise is demonstrated mainly by the so-called bank and insurance cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.933" offset="8579114">The bank owns an office building.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.268" offset="8592488">It uses part of the office building itself and it rents out to the general public the balance of the building.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.127" offset="8615894">Prior to the institution of the enterprise doctrine, the bank guard was subject to the Act and the office building guard, he worked along side with him was not subject to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.058" offset="8659571">And to correct that, Congress said, if you are in an enterprise then this is where both people should be under the same Act and I quite agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.651" offset="8693948">But that’s not the situation with we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.826" offset="8702725">In that case again, the ownership was the bank who own the office building and that I said Your Honors is what a true enterprise really is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.631" offset="8749850">Now, there was some discussion when the Honorable Solicitor was talking about some of the economic reality and situation and this Court has said that when we are dealing with social legislation such as this, we must look at the economic realities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.283" offset="8816515">Now, what are the economic realities with respect to the employees of these separate buildings?</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.595" offset="8837726">First place, the employees go with the building.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.406" offset="8849011">They don’t go with Arnheim and Neely.</text>

            <text syncTime="2681.371" offset="10828884">But I repeat that we still don’t know what kind -- whether we are talking about employer for coverage or employer for purposes of enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.777" offset="10862529">The Third Circuit has pointed out the anomaly that is created if the Arnheim and Neely business is considered an enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.205" offset="10900146">It would be anomalous said the Court to treat the owners of commercial buildings as proprietors of individual businesses when they manage the buildings themselves and as participate in a common business purpose with other building owners merely because they hire a rental agent who manages other buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.551" offset="10969527">Now, Your Honor I can point this up with an illustration from Arnheim and Neely’s own situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.093" offset="10995754">At the time this suit was instituted, Arnheim and Neely manage the building called University Square number one, a ten-storey apartment building.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.162" offset="11035982">Next to what is University Square number two not managed by Arnheim and Neely, a similar ten-storey building separated only by a party wall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.500" offset="11077360">If the Government’s theory is correct, the janitor in University Square number one is covered by the Act and the janitor in University Square number two is not covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.081" offset="11123649">Now this is a situation where the Government is creating a disparity between employees coverage whereas, the Congress was trying to avoid this when they pressed the enterprise doctrine where two employees side by side where not covered by the same act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.064" offset="11183626">Now, the Government comes in and says we’re going to cover some of these and not cover others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.197" offset="11200136">And the very question of the coverage of each of these employees depends on who the management agent might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.106" offset="11239842">So, I say Your Honors that if Arnheim and Neely is an agent which it is and if Arnheim and Neely manages buildings which it does, and if Arnheim and Neely manages buildings which are all local in character which they are, how can the agent rise higher than his principle?</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.127" offset="11343914">How can the Government do indirectly what it can’t do directly because of the Callus case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.480" offset="11369305">Congress never intended such a result, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.475" offset="11381321">The law doesn’t provide for it and the logic and reasoning had shown in the Third Circuit opinion should be sustained.</text>

            <text syncTime="2834.875" offset="11442866">Mr. Chief Justice and if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.805" offset="11458644">I think it’s apparent why the institute of Real Estate Management is concerned about this case, your permission now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.598" offset="11489782">I just make one brief argument concerning the construction of the statute, and that is that we don’t believe the Congress intended the result that the Government position would achieve in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.744" offset="11554356">We’ve been arguing about what is an enterprise and what is an employer and what is an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.814" offset="11578598">But we believe when the statute doesn’t define itself and you apply it to a set of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.471" offset="11597302">If you are convinced that Congress didn’t intend to that result that that should bear on your interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.138" offset="11619976">Now, I based that on two premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.020" offset="11635440">It’s my understanding that it is acknowledged that Congress didn’t go as far as they might go under the Interstate Commerce Act with the Fair Labor Standards Act, something has held back and Congress itself adopted the monetary limit, a financial limit in its application so I argue that there is a Congressional intent that there are still to be some local buildings that do not have to meet the minimum wage, the overtime requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.229" offset="11748289">It’s purely economic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.672" offset="11754036">I argue that Congress intended that somebody is still left up whether they should be or not, I suggest that that’s what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.887" offset="11786951">The consequence here is, in the opinion of the clients that I represent and there are some 2,500, pardon me, these realtors in the institute represent some 2,500 small office buildings and some 5,000 small apartment buildings across the country and that’s why the District Court permitted the intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.164" offset="11876080">It is our concern that if this rule applies and the building owner considers the employment of a rental agent, he would be well advised to ask that rental agent two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.188" offset="11924146">First, are you Mr. rental agent in interstate commerce?</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.317" offset="11936684">Secondly, do you have any other client who is?</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.317" offset="11948596">Because if the answer is yes to either of those questions and automatically I go in and automatically my elevator operator, my maintenance people are paid time and a half.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.039" offset="11983496">I can’t afford it will effect my maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.141" offset="11995930">Pardon me, my financial operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.933" offset="12007111">This as we see it is coverage by association with whom do you associate yourself and not who are you and what do you do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.863" offset="12038875">So that is the position if Your Honors please of the institute that we can get lost in a morass of semantics in using manufactured words and statutory words like enterprise and employer and employee and we find our selves chasing our tail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.722" offset="12102301">But if we are convinced that Congress never intended the result that this would achieve, we submit that that is the place to fire and the answer for the pure construction of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.288" offset="12144515">And we’re quite convinced and I think if Your Honor will reflect on it, the idea that you get coverage by association and not by your own status or activity would lead to conclusion that however you do it, whether why an interpretation of enterprise whether by an interpretation of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.229" offset="12220270">The achievement here of a result not intended by Congress should not be sustained.</text>
