            <text syncTime="35.927" offset="247097">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.380" offset="260890">This case is here on certiorari to the First Circuit, which denied enforcement of the Board's order against respondent Union, a local of the Textile Workers Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.546" offset="309582">The case involves an application of the principles formulated by this Court in the Allis-Chalmers and Scofield cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.132" offset="355871">Section 8(b)(1)(A) of the National Labor Relations Act makes it an unfair labor practice for a Union to restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of their Section 7 rights which includes the right to engage in concerted activity and the right to refrain from engaging in concerted activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.685" offset="438105">The question presented here is whether a Union violates Section 8(b)(1)(A) by fining employees who return to work during the strike after they had resigned from Union membership and by seeking judicial enforcement of the fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.286" offset="524518">The facts are briefly these.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.037" offset="539564">The Union for many years has been the collective bargaining representative of the employees of the International Paper Box Machine Company in New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.215" offset="584182">On September 14, 1968, six days before the scheduled expiration of the collective-bargaining agreement, the Union membership voted to strike, if a new agreement was not reached by September 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.901" offset="650951">No agreement reached and the strike was attended, and picketing began on that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.688" offset="678118">On September 21, the Union held a meeting to discuss strike organization in which the membership approved the resolution to anyone aiding or abetting the company would be subject to a fine of $2,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.570" offset="745618">All but three or four of the 160 employees in the bargaining unit were Union members and all of the Union members went out on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.183" offset="808103">The contract that had just expired had a maintenance-of-membership provision in it which required employees who were Union members at the time of the contract became effective or who joined the Union during the term of the contract to remain members during the contract term.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.967" offset="907264">Practically, all of the Union members attended both the strike authorization and the fine authorization meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.041" offset="943522">The members assented to the strike by a standing vote with only one member dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.550" offset="973615">The motion to levy the fine was adopted unanimously without discussion.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="319.984" stopTime="509.182">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="319.984" offset="1383320">Under the principle that the Board is applying, the cut off is whether they resigned before they engaged in the activity for which they are being fined.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.152" offset="1444028">In another words, if they went to work before they resigned, in the Board's view, under Allis-Chalmers, the fine would be okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.950" offset="1507140">If they resigned before they went to work and then were fined, in the Board's view, that would not be protected and that's what you have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.755" offset="1562415">In the Boeing case, you have also a mid-position or you have some people who resigned after they went back to work and what the Board did in Boeing was to sustain the fine as to the activity that occurred, the strikebreaking activity that occurred before the resignation, but thereafter held that the fine was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.223" offset="1688221">But you don't have that mid-position here because it's perfectly clear that all of the 31 employees who were fined first took the step of notifying the Union of their resignation before they went back to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.359" offset="1764812">Now you -- as I have indicated, during the course of this strike which was still going on at the time of the Board's second hearing which was 18 months after its inception, you had 31 employees who, beginning some month-and-a-half to two months and the poke occurring from seven-and-a-half to twelve months during the course of the strike, submitted resignations to the Union and went back to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.771" offset="1914441">The Union notified them that they had -- were in violation of the Union rules, and ordered them to appear for a hearing before the Union tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.830" offset="1978702">They did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.297" offset="1984554">They were tried in absentia and fined the equivalent of a day's wages for each day work during the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.356" offset="2020812">And when none of the employees paid the fines, the Union filed suits in the state courts to collect the fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.664" offset="2054040">The suits are still pending and the employees in turn filed unfair labor practice charges with the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.099" offset="2091760">The Board concluded that the 31 employees had affectively resigned from the Union before returning to work, that the Union violated Section 8(b)(1)(A) of the Act --</text>

            <text syncTime="511.775" offset="2150484">No resignation was submitted in any of the 31 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.562" offset="2181622">So until after that meeting at which the resolution was passed that anyone who crossed the picket line would be subject to a fine of $2,000.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="530.017" offset="2223417">And is it that fact that the Board relies on particularly?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="538.001" stopTime="886.794">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="538.001" offset="2255391">It was that fact that the Court of Appeals was relied on in reversing the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.463" offset="2277230">The Court of Appeals said that since they had participated in the strike vote, they in effect had by analogy to the charitable subscription line of cases made a contract with the Union to see the strike through, and the Board's position -- submission that strike vote is not sufficient to override the employee's Section 7 right to resign from the Union and go back to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.834" offset="2418709">That's the issue we have in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.036" offset="2431561">Well, in Allis-Chalmers, this Court held that a Union did not violate Section 8(b)1(A) of the Act by fining employees who went to work during the strike authorized by the Union membership and by suing in court to enforce the fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.313" offset="2536573">The Court, balancing the Union's need to preserve solidarity during the strike against the employee's Section 7 right to refrain from engaging in concerted activities, concluded that the Union discipline there did not violate Section 8(b)(1)(A) because as we read the Court's opinion, it was imposed against the member pursuing through the contract of membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.500" offset="2641377">The employees there were full members of the Union and the infraction of the Union strike rule occurred, while they were full members of the Union, and therefore, they were subject to the Union discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.717" offset="2734268">In the subsequent Scofield case, the Court in holding that the Union did not violate Section 8(b)(1)(A) by levying a court enforced fine against employees who violated a Union production rule that was acquiesced in by the employer, laid down this test which we think is applicable here for applying Section 8(b)(1)(A), namely that it leaves a Union free to enforce a properly adopted rule which reflects a legitimate Union interest, impairs no policy which Congress has embedded in the labor laws, and is reasonably enforced against Union members who are free to leave the Union and escape the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.019" offset="2963414">Now we think that the principle to be distilled that's relevant here is that the power to levy a court enforceable fine on an employee for breach of a legitimate Union rule which this is, is co terminus with the Union member contract or relationship and in the Board's view that was terminated here by the resignations for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.175" offset="3112103">The Union's constitution and bylaws contained no provision defining or limiting the circumstances under which a member could resign from the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.158" offset="3159960">Under the law of governing voluntary associations, where there is no specific provision with respect to resignations, it's settled that a member may resign at will.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.183" offset="3216071">Now the Union contends however that even if the 31 employees could thus effectively sever ties with the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.531" offset="3269465">Even the Court of Appeals was willing to concede that the absent of any provision, the resignation here was affective for most purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.646" offset="3321919">These 31 employees were none the less bound to support the strike until its conclusion because it's only reasonable to construe the Union's constitution and bylaws, as imposing by implication and obligation to see a strike through to its end or in any event, that conclusion is warranted here in view of the employee's participation in the strike vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.486" offset="3465279">We submit that neither of these arguments warrants on different conclusion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.895" offset="3510941">In the first place with respect to implying by implication an obligation in the Union's constitution and bylaws to see the strike through at the end -- to the end, we're coming across a very important right that's guaranteed by Section 7 of the Act which gives to all employees, including Union members the right to refrain from engaging in concerted activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1003.157" offset="4116041">There are instances where waivers have been upheld and it really comes down to a basic and Board's and the Court's judgment would be as to the right to refrain is in Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.770" offset="4230457">There are some rights that have been held not to be a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.241" offset="4248325">Now, given the statutory right in Section 7, however, it is well settled that a waiver of statutory rights if it can be waived, has got to be expressed, and you would go against that principle if you found a waiver by implication in the constitution and bylaws here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.112" offset="4355845">Secondly, there is very good reason, for not the party from the principle of requiring an express waiver because a contract of membership is a rather unusual contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.319" offset="4416658">A member becomes bond by the Union's constitution and bylaws upon joining the Union even though he had no real part in formulating the provisions of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.269" offset="4460440">It's like a contract of adhesion similar to an insurance policy, and the principle applicable there is between two possible interpretations, you give the break of the party who had no part in formulating the terms of the contract, and thirdly, the decision whether to resign from a Union and return to work during a strike presents the employee with a very, very difficult choice, a choice that can be most meaningfully made in the particular strike situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.862" offset="4642774">Therefore, it can't readily be assumed that a employee if he could waive the right would willingly want to do so by implication. Four, while the employees may be sympathetic to a strike when it's first called, events occurring thereafter which he may not have anticipated, may lead him to alter his view and a desire to return to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.138" offset="4763878">For example, he may have underestimated the time that the strike is going to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.780" offset="4782477">This strike, as I indicated, was going on for at least 18 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.441" offset="4809122">And underestimating the duration, he may have underestimated the resultant hardship to himself, to his family or underestimated the employer's ability to find replacements for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.877" offset="4882892">On the other hand, the decision to resign from the Union and abandon the strike is going to subject the employee to the individual to his right to participate in Union meetings, to which policies are formulated, both for Union officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.337" offset="4964707">It may deprive them of certain Union benefits, subject them to a certain social stigma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.743" offset="5002324">So he has a difficult choice to make here and we submit that the policies of the Act are thus effectuated by holding as the Board has, that if he can waive his right at all, it has to be an express waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.442" offset="5077138">Now what about the strike mode here which is what the Court of Appeals relied on as making the difference?</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.180" offset="5120084">We believe that the strike for vote is an unreliable basis for determining rights and obligations under the Act, particularly where it was by a voice vote such as you had here because the employees may be induced the strike by a bandwagon psychology.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.672" offset="5226036">As a matter of fact, one of the employees here testified that, yes, he stood up, but he stood up because everybody else was standing up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.036" offset="5267519">But be that as it may, assuming that you really wanted to support the strike, we believe that it's unrealistic to conclude that any employee voting to strike in 68, knowingly made a waiver to support that strike to the bitter end no matter how long it went on or no matter what his own personal situation may have developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.606" offset="5413804">Certainly we believe that it's unreasonable to attribute to the employee in intention to support the strike even after he would be willing to take the very severe step of resigning from the Union.</text>

            <text syncTime="1427.287" offset="5812537">There is one thing that the Union cannot do, and that is to affect a job right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.198" offset="5860185">Now you talked about the kind of contract that they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.631" offset="5873873">The kind of contract that they had was a maintenance-of-membership, a contract which doesn't require you to be a member in order to keep your employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.583" offset="5917654">If they had been successful in getting a Union shop agreement which they did not have, under a Union-Shop Agreement, you have to become a member of the Union within 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.736" offset="5998320">They might have been able to require that they pay dues as a condition of continuing employment under the Taft-Hartley Act, that kind of thing, but you could not require them, at least as we understand the law, to actually become a full member of the Union and thus subject themselves to Union discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.950" offset="6107199">And a further point that I wanted to make is that in most strike situations, the vote is not by standing vote, but by secret ballot and to try to find out how somebody voted where it's by secret ballot would impair the secrecy of the ballot and lead to further complications, and finally, if you made the strike vote determinative, we believe that there is a serious risk of deterring Union democracy because employees would be fearful that by participating in the vote or in the discussions, that they might be hooked forever respective of what may develop might decide to play it safe and not participate which is certainly not a --</text>

            <text syncTime="1612.003" offset="6551385">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.626" offset="6569880">There are several points that I think there is some emphasis in analyzing this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.729" offset="6598301">First of all, I think, it should be pointed out that in this case the Board is now seeking to have the, what is an already rendered decision of the state court of New Hampshire reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.649" offset="6681997">In this case, the Union sought enforcement of the fines and sought collection of other contract remedies that it had against these 31 individuals in the New Hampshire court and a motion to dismiss that action was filed and after a hearing, there was a ruling by Mr. Justice Flynn of the New Hampshire superior court denying the motion to dismiss and accepting a sitting jurisdiction for the New Hampshire court for the determination of these membership issues acting as the opinion points out and I have attached the opinion as a slip to the brief of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.304" offset="6880632">The judge pointed out that the New Hampshire court was acting in a federally unentered enclaved mentioned by this Court in the Scofield case and in the earlier decision of Machinists against Gonzales where you would recall the state court's ruling that the Union had improperly expelled and an individual was held to be a matter for decision of the state court, and not a matter reserved to Board under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.118" offset="7023888">Secondly, the Board now seeks of course to have that decision of the New Hampshire court reversed without in any way proceeding against the decision in New Hampshire by a way of Federal Court injunction or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.777" offset="7106435">Secondly, it seems to me that we have here three distinct classes of members that gets somewhat lost in the intricacy of the case, but there were some 160 odd employees of this company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.921" offset="7191071">Three or four of the employees at all times elected to act pursuant to their Section 7 right not to join the Union and not to engage in concerted activities.T</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.699" offset="7258154">hose employees never joined the Union, never participated in Union affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.970" offset="7279261">They refused to join in the strike and in fact, it show -- the record shows that they continued to work all during the lengthy strike that occurred passing to and follow from the picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.147" offset="7339969">And there is of course nothing in the record which in anyway indicates that any of their Section 7 rights to refrain were in anyway impinged upon by the actions of the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.881" offset="7386885">On the contrary, those rights were scrupulously observed by the Union and these people, we say comes squarely within the Section 7 rights and don't come within the special proviso of Section 81 which gives the Union the right to act in these situations and making membership rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.344" offset="7504750">Those employees would carefully have their rights carefully preserved under Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.780" offset="7530454">Now it's our position that with respect to the other 160 employees, they were all mature men who voluntarily elected to join the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.445" offset="7581132">There was no pressure of a Union shop or any other outward pressure with respect to their jobs which would compel them to join the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.096" offset="7631705">They freely elected to join the Union on their own and then as the contract that was about to expire, they met in a democratic meeting and voted to engage in the strike as a new contract could not be reached with the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.858" offset="7722820">Now that vote for strike was part of the democratic process and a part of the Union's legislative activities which this Court referred to in the above -- in the Allis-Chalmers case as part of the National Labor Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.333" offset="7792724">But these individuals and the 31 individuals from the Board seeks to protect in their strikebreaking activities in this case, all of these employees, first of all met and voted to engage in the strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="1956.878" offset="7930859">Yes, our position with respect to them is that there was an established Union procedure, now they are not spelled out in the constitution, but there was an established Union procedure set forth in the membership application card and the check-off authorization record, under which an employee was free to resign his membership in the ten-day period following the termination of the contract, and that that was an appropriate time for any employee who did not want to participate in the concerted activity of the strike to resign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.808" offset="8090624">As the Union pointed out that there had been an established practice and in fact one of the 31 members whom the Board is seeking to protect here, his name was Hassan Johnson, he was an employee who had joined the Union after spending sometime in the employment of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.133" offset="8167946">Then he had decided to resign from the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.529" offset="8181530">His resignation had been timely filed at a previous contract termination and was accepted by the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.196" offset="8216116">Then he changed his mind again and reapplied for admission to the Union and now after many months of the strike, he resigned again for the second time and the Union at all times has taken a position that those second resignations were untimely, but they would have been timely, had they been filed at the conclusion of the contract and at the inception of the strike in that ten-day period.</text>

            <text syncTime="2098.376" offset="8496880">And the application for membership card of course contained this ten-day escape period immediately above the signature of every member of the Union.</text>

            <text syncTime="2986.200" offset="12048175">Yes, it's -- I think that's the central position that we take.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.660" offset="12066043">That is when the Union members vote to go out on strike, they know they are engaging in a serious economic confrontation that can last for an in-determinant period and they obligate themselves to see that enterprise through till its termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.435" offset="12161128">It's is termination I might say, it might come either because the exercise of the economic forces on both of the parties gets them into a compromised position, or one of the other side yields sufficiently to arrive at an accommodation or as in the case here, the Union finally votes to abandon or discontinue a strike, that's wasn't in the record here, but ultimately that's what happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="3046.193" offset="12288188">Was there any meeting of the Union membership subsequent to the September 21st meeting 1968 when they voted to impose the fine?</text>

            <text syncTime="3055.819" offset="12326640">Oh yes, there were constant meetings where the officers reported back to the membership on the status of negotiations and the situation once the Union was in where they voted to undertake items, for example like the insurance matter which I referred to a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.405" offset="12424965">That wasn't spelled out very carefully in the record, but I think there is, perhaps a brief reference to it in some of the letters of resignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.406" offset="12457044">One or more of the members complained that he didn't like the way one of those meetings would run, but there were frequent meetings at which there was ample opportunity for these 31 employees to exercise their democratic right within the Union to persuade any of the others to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.193" offset="12536142">And we say that that's the position that this Court left the parties in, in the Scofield case, namely that the Union and the National Labor Policy is one that favors the democratic operation of Union affairs, that the Union has these legislative powers with respect to collective bargaining, that when they democratically vote to undertake a strike, the only thing that remains open after that is the settlement of the strike or the democratic -- use of the democratic practice to change the position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.955" offset="12683160">In the Scofield quotation that's relied on by the Board, if you back up a few sentences, I think that's made clear by the Court that the Court points out that it's the right of an individual to exert his democratic influence or his influence on the body and had been -- have his minority position, if you will, change to a majority position by persuasion, and that position is the one that is in accord with the legislative policy under the act and is in effect the only way that the contract commitment can be changed by mutual agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.627" offset="12885870">We point that the Board itself in dealing with associations, for example, that are put together for the purpose of mutual collective bargaining, lays down the rule that you can only withdraw from such an association prior to the time that the association engages in collective bargaining, that a subsequent withdrawal must be by mutual consent rather than by an individual having an individual veto power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.427" offset="13021080">If you allow the Board's position of course, each individual has a right to veto the legislative examination of the majority, and you have not a democratic proposition but (Inaudible) within the Union which allows each member to be an individual breaker of the joint commitment, and there again, we pointed out situations, where in the past, the Court has held that an individual waives his right to engage in strikes when the Union votes to accept a contract against striking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.394" offset="13196936">There are various other situations that we have referred to in the brief, where for one reason or another, the individual member's right to either engage in a strike or not to engage in a strike is affected by the majority determination of the Union in accordance with the National Labor Policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3301.545" offset="13309576">I just wanted to point out as Mr. Justice Rehnquist noted that the Court of Appeals found on pages 5 (a) to 6 (a) of the petition, adopted a Trial Examiner's finding that there was no evidence that the employees knew of this practice or that they considered this limitation and their right to resign, that is with respect to this ten-day point that Mr. Roitman has been making.</text>

            <text syncTime="3342.223" offset="13472266">Well, suppose we were to say that if you've signed in it, you did not know about it, and it was effective, and then say is to whether or not they were members at the time they actually resigned?</text>

            <text syncTime="3360.001" offset="13543424">Well, I think that there you would have an issue that would probably have to be remanded to the Board because as the Board found the facts here, this ten-day provision was not something first of all that had anything to do with resigning from the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.394" offset="13620955">It was a combination of membership and check-off clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.638" offset="13633912">The Trail Examiner found that the ten-day provision related only to the check-off provision, not to the resignation from Union membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.196" offset="13668185">He further found that there was no evidence in the record that showed that the employees were made aware that this was the way that you had to resign from the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.672" offset="13714056">The Court of Appeals sustained that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.569" offset="13725654">We submit that it is supported by a substantial evidence for the additional reason, as Justice Marshall pointed out that nowhere in the letters that were sent to the employees, as to -- has any mention made of the fact that the resignation was improper because it didn't comply with the ten-day rule.</text>
