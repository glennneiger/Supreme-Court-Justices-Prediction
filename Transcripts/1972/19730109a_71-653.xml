            <label>Mr. Richard A. Billups, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="65.122" offset="363813">This is a case where charges were pending against the plaintiff optometrists for having before the Alabama State Board of Optometry, after having scheduled them for a hearing before this Board of Optometry and before the hearing, this suit was filed to enjoin the Board from hearing the charges and the Board voluntarily agreed to withhold further action until this case has been finally disposed off.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.754" offset="514382">The plaintiffs in their complaint allege a violation of the civil rights of the optometrists under Section 1983 of the Federal Civil Rights Act on the part of the defendant, Board members and later filed a second cause of action alleging that Sections 192 and 206 of the Alabama optometry law were unconstitutional and requested a hearing before a three-judged court which was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.437" offset="677073">The defendants assert that there was no misconduct on their part and so answered and also filed a motion to dismiss the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.307" offset="728586">The issues were joined on a stipulation of facts and briefs presented to Court which granted an injunction against the State Board, its members and successors in office from hearing the charges and in addition, held Section 192 and 206 unconstitutional on the theory that said Section 192, that a Board member must be eligible for appointment, had to be a member in good standing of the Alabama Optometric Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.687" offset="930147">And that Section 206 of the Optometry Law while providing the procedure for handling and hearing any charges filed before it was unconstitutional because even though it provided for an appeal from an adverse decision, it failed to spell out supersedeas pending on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.903" offset="1055013">The defendants answered that these two Sections of the Optometry Law had been held to be constitutional by the Alabama Supreme Court in a prior case of McCoy versus Wood and was not violative of the federal constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.263" offset="1160443">The holding of the Court, of the trial court, if sustained, will destroy virtually every state created licensing Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.345" offset="1204746">Because in most instances, they have the same general provision such as Section 192 that Board Members must be members of the association to be eligible for appointment, and 206 of the Alabama law which provides for the handling of charges and in the Alabama law 206, it provides that from an adverse ruling, the optometrist can appeal to the Circuit Court of his home county.</text>

            <text syncTime="510.004" offset="2143378">Now, but during the course of the proceedings and I will get the -- and in order to cover that point that you have just raised, the state board adapted a regulation stating that any event of an adverse decision, the state board would take no action or hold the matter in abeyance until the appeal had been completed and determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.637" offset="2309935">So, that then would not even require a supersedeas because the regulation of course has the effect of law.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Billups, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="575.526" offset="2405439">No sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.409" offset="2424978">There was no time limit in the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.195" offset="2440129">Now, these charges grow out of a series of events that have transpired over a number of years and while these dates are set out in the various pleadings, I believe it would be helpful for this Honorable Court to know the sequence because among other things, the Board is charged with harassment of the defendant optometrist because of the fact that these charges laid dormant for a long number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.689" offset="2706160">But for many years and then from the adoption of the optometry law in 1990, Section 210 of the optometry law permitted a retailer or a store to maintain an optometric department wherein eyes were examined and glassed fitted, provided there was an optometrist in charge of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.412" offset="2820995">That’s what's sometimes referred to as corporate practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.159" offset="2843982">Now, on August 4th, 1965, Section 210 was repealed in its entirety, which we contend, lets it fall back on the general rule that’s well recognized that in the absence of statutory authority, a person cannot practice a profession through -- a corporation cannot practice a profession through the employment of a licensed professional.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.934" offset="3019107">And we’ve had optometrists and physicians involved in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.189" offset="3048155">In August of 1965, shortly after this repeal, the State Board notified all optometrists to comply and offer their assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.756" offset="3102386">Then, on October 26, 1965, charges filed by the Alabama Association with the Board were filed which included charges against these plaintiffs below who were employed at that time by Lee Optical Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.680" offset="3210115">A short time later, the state board filed an injunction suit against Lee Optical Company and the employed optometrists, including one physician, alleging that the optometrists were aiding and abating Lee Optical in the unlawful practice of optometry and by so doing, they themselves were unlawfully practicing optometry.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.335" offset="3340727">Unfortunately, there was no precedent in Alabama for the filing of such an injunction suit in any of the professional fields perhaps because of the fact that the Section 210 which permitted corporations to function as they did discouraged others in filing any suits in any other field.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.187" offset="3476146">Now, then the defendants, all of them filed a motion to abate and this motion was sustained because as I say, there was no precedent for the filing of such an injunction suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.842" offset="3558693">Now, in other states, there is a statutory authority for filing of such suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.171" offset="3596100">Then the defendants filed a motion to abate and the Court sustained that motion to abate and an appeal was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.935" offset="3675094">Now, then, in September of 1967, the Alabama legislature passed Act Number 509, giving all boards the right to bring an injunction suit against anyone unlawfully practicing in their field and made it retroactive.</text>
