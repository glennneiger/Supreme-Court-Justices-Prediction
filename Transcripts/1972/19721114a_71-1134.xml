            <text syncTime="57.782" offset="334451">The single issue in this case arises out of the conviction of the petitioner in the Circuit Court of Pulaski County, Kentucky following a jury trial for violating Kentucky's Obscenity Statute which is Kentucky Revised statute, Chapter 436, section 101.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.142" offset="419924">Petitioner was convicted under subsection (2) of that statue which may be found on pages 3 and 4 of the brief for petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.098" offset="463809">The facts in this case are simple and for the most part undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.239" offset="492335">On the 9 -- September the 29th, 1970, the sheriff of Pulaski County, Kentucky purchased a ticket to Highway 27 Drive-In Theater which was managed by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.659" offset="558059">The sheriff viewed the entire film being exhibited that evening which was entitled Cindy and Donna.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.750" offset="598392">Immediately following the exhibition of the film, the sheriff proceeded to the projection booth of the theater and there arrested the petitioner upon a charge of violating the statue and seized the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.071" offset="683656">At the time the arrest was made and the film was seized, there was no warrant in the hands of the sheriff issued by any magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.399" offset="724929">No magistrate had viewed the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.144" offset="739976">There were no descriptive affidavits before, for instance, any magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.018" offset="763486">Immediately there was no hearing of any kind before a judicial officer, advisory or ex parte to focus on the question of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.658" offset="813955">The sheriff upon viewing the film, ex parte and on his own made a determination that the film was obscene and such ex parte determination on his part led to the arrest and seizure of the film.</text>

            <text syncTime="467.088" offset="1971702">On the day following the arrest of the petitioner and the seizure of this film, the sheriff took it to the Grand Jury of Pulaski County and an indictment was returned charging the petitioner with the offense for which he was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.707" offset="2034186">The petitioner three days later pleaded not guilty and the case was set for trail on the 20th of October.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.827" offset="2074728">On the 12th of October the petitioner moved to suppress this film as evidence and to dismiss the indictment contending as he does here today, that the film was illegally seized in violation of due process of law because there had been no adversary hearing prior to the seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.326" offset="2148707">The motion to suppress and dismiss the indictment was overruled and petitioner's trial began.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.943" offset="2171173">Now petitioner at the trial again objected to admission of the film in evidence and renewed his motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.958" offset="2203251">The Trial Court overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.047" offset="2211610">The issue was again raised before the Court of Appeals of Kentucky and that court affirmed the conviction on June the 25th 1971 and denied a re-hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.887" offset="2254869">At no point, prior to the seizure that the petitioner or anyone in his behalf had an opportunity to contest the judgment of the sheriff that this film was obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.722" offset="2298232">So that's presented the single issue of whether in the absence of a prior adversary hearing, the seizure incident to arrest of allegedly obscene material is a violation of due process of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="632.638" offset="2633958">We did not concede the obscenity and -- but for the protection of material that is not obscene whether this material will turn out to be obscene or not or whether it was conceded that any time during the trial, we don't think it is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.222" offset="2716296">We think it was clothed with the same procedural safeguards as non-obscene material until the determination in the adversary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.613" offset="2773870">Petitioner and his contention here relies on the opinions of this Court in Marcus versus Search Warrant properly, A Quantity of Books versus Kansas, and Lee Art Theatre versus Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.744" offset="2846386">And the gist again of petitioner's contention is that discretion to seize allegedly obscene material cannot be confided to law enforcement officers without some safeguards for the protection of non-obscene material.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.103" offset="2911796">And a seizure without a warrant such as occurred in this case, there were no safeguards at all to prevent this question of not obscene film which are protected by the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.120" offset="2959862">And because First Amendment rights are involved here the sheriff of Pulaski County, Kentucky have no discretion to say that a crime have been committed in his presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.222" offset="3008240">A State is not free, this Court said in Marcus to adopt whatever procedures it pleases for dealing with obscenity without regard to the possible consequences for constitutionally protected speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.896" offset="3058918">And the line between speech unconditionally guaranteed and speech which may legitimately be punished is finely drawn, it's dim and uncertain and separation of the legitimate for the illegitimate, calls for the use of sensitive tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.031" offset="3119522">So here we have an ex parte non-judicial determination of probable obscenity by a law enforcement officer and the thief.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.633" offset="3153899">The sheriff acted as judge and in a sense no where was there any procedure designed to focus searching -- on the question of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.274" offset="3192456">This film had shown for two nights prior to the seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.165" offset="3208025">There was no emergency or danger to the community which compelled the seizure without at least a warrant or some prior judicial scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.539" offset="3245537">The test of obscenity as laid down of this Court in the Roth case as so apply then it must be made judicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.243" offset="3284302">To permit unbridled discretion on law enforcement officers to apply such tests amounts to a vague understanding of this delegation of judicial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.588" offset="3333726">We believe that Marcus and Books required the court of law to make the determination that there is probable cause to believe the film obscene and this only after a meaning opportunity to be heard in an adversary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.152" offset="3392031">Police officers in the field are not equipped to apply the test and separate the legitimate from the illegitimate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1203.864" offset="4918836">On September 28, 1970, the deputy sheriff of Pulaski County observed approximately 30 minutes of the film "Cindy and Donna" from advantage point outside of the theater at a road nearby.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.114" offset="4983829">Thereafter he reported to a superior, the sheriff of Pulaski County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.471" offset="5005249">The next evening as was noted, on September 29th, 1970, the sheriff accompanied, in this case by the commonwealth attorney, who is the chief prosecuting officer for that district, paid admission for entrance into the theater for showing of the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.623" offset="5077870">After viewing of the entire film, the entire film, the sheriff proceeded to the projection booth and arrested the petitioner, Mr. Roaden, who was at that time changing the carton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.057" offset="5123636">I believe it was on the projection theater was upside down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.367" offset="5152789">The sheriff seized the film incident to the lawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.650" offset="5169925">The following day on September 30th, the matter was presented to the Grand Jury who returned the indictment, a trial on the merits of the case was had and a verdict was entered October 21st, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.173" offset="5236067">Now there are certain facts in this case they are somewhat peculiar.</text>

            <text syncTime="2311.375" offset="9348890">It is an obscene film requiring an adversary hearing as suggested by petitioner, would put law enforcement officials on a untenable position of trying to enforce laws while which this Court and the Commonwealth of Kentucky say are lawful, while putting obstacles and the best means -- for the best means of doing so in the way of the law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.090" offset="9447737">In this respect, I think it's important that we enforce white collar crime, laws against white collar crime just as much as we do crimes of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.619" offset="9489847">Obviously, if you can get by with white collar crimes such as obscenity or consumer protection or environmental laws, this breaks down a respect for the judiciary and the law enforcement officials if they can see this going on here and the other man who does a crime of violence is immediately placed in custody and tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.609" offset="9601860">As we noted earlier the petitioner did not move for return of his material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.792" offset="9630490">We feel that it can be assumed that his purpose for this motion which he made before the Court was for the purpose of suppression of an obscene film to avoid prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.238" offset="9684302">There was a speedy review of the action taken by taking the matter before the Grand Jury of Pulaski County the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.837" offset="9718680">And Your Honor, as it please the Court, I would like to state that in an attempt not to overstate my case, in my brief I may have understated my case on a particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.079" offset="9767685">On page 11, I stated although a failure to indict by Grand Jury would not have assured petitioner of his release or the release of his film, the fact that it went before the Grand Jury was showing a good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.608" offset="9829752">I would like to correct any ambiguity there by saying that pursuant to the Kentucky Rules of Criminal Procedure 5.22, if a defendant is not indicted by Grand Jury, he must be released, however, a subsequent Grand Jury could later indict it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.425" offset="9901119">This is Marcus v. Bradley, 385 S.W. 2nd 165.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.519" offset="9925465">A failure of the Grand Jury in this case to indict would have resulted in the release of petitioner, immediate release and he would have remained free absent a subsequent Grand Jury indictment and presumably his film would have been released with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.495" offset="9981367">I might add that if his film was not released, he could have made a motion to the court for its release and if the lower court refused to do a it a writ mandamus would be a proper remedy before Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.136" offset="10039881">This was indicated in the case of Johnson versus Commonwealth, 475 S.W. 2nd 893 which was decided subsequent to the case before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.453" offset="10085230">There was a speedy trial in this case,the 22 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.828" offset="10106650">This was done in order to zealously guard petitioner's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.565" offset="10125667">This court recently in U.S. versus 37 Photographs held that where there were seizure of allegedly obscene material by custom officials, there would not be an undue hardship if the forfeiture proceedings were commenced within 14 days and completed it within 60 days of their commencement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.892" offset="10210931">This would allow a total of 74 days from seizure to decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.162" offset="10232038">Now in our present case before our Kentucky Court of Appeals, there was seizure on September 29th, 1970 and indictment the following day and the trial was concluded on October 21st, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.839" offset="10286686">This was some 22 days after the arrest and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.974" offset="10307271">And I submit to the Court that this is significantly less than the 74 days that was indicated in the 37 photographs case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2702.205" offset="10912162">Thank you Mr. Bullock, Mr. Wicker, do you have anything further?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="phillip_k_wicker" startTime="2705.790" stopTime="2811.984">
            <label>Mr. Phillip K. Wicker</label>
            <text syncTime="2705.790" offset="10926582">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.131" offset="10951868">As to the expertise of the sheriff of Pulaski County, in this case, if a comparison is made of the sheriff's reading of the Roth definition of obscenity which he copied from the Kentucky Statute is shown on page 17 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.145" offset="11051969">A comparison of that what statute actually says as shown on Page 3 of the petitioner's brief preferably illustrates that the sheriff did not even read the definition of obscenity much less comprehend it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.799" offset="11126575">(Inaudible) to the average person applying to a temporary standard when the statute says applying contemporary community standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.960" offset="11179238">Now we make the point that the petitioner also contends that his Fourth Amendment rights have been violated in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.033" offset="11235453">The prosecution would distinguish the Books and Marcus cases by saying that in those cases large quantities of books were seized while in this case only one copy of a film was seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.901" offset="11286967">We say that this distinction is not likely significant because a single film is equal when disseminated in parts to a large quantity of books, it's equal to the entire stock of the newsdealer or to the entire inventory of the the newsdealer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2811.984" offset="11351333">That's the state's position here that one exhibition reaches many, many people, are you supporting the state's position on that score?</text>

            <label>Mr. Phillip K. Wicker</label>
            <text syncTime="2821.216" offset="11388217">The restrained imposed upon us exhibition deprives many people of an opportunity to see the film, to receive the expression and the ideas contained therein.</text>

            <text syncTime="2836.354" offset="11448822">But if it's obscenity do you concede that it -- they are not entitled to exhibit it and people are not entitled to receive it, if it is obscenity?</text>

          <turn speaker="phillip_k_wicker" startTime="2850.363" stopTime="3180.104">
            <label>Mr. Phillip K. Wicker</label>
            <text syncTime="2850.363" offset="11504828">Again, Your Honor, the determination is so sensitive under the Roth test that there is no other way, to determine obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.739" offset="11558327">I say that it can't be delegated to local police officers in the field and it's not any answer to say that just one copy of the film was seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.782" offset="11610467">The effect of the seizure, of one seizure and one prosecution can perceive ripple effect from its source and we say that the First Amendment affords national protection at a scope that extends beyond Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.953" offset="11687163">Another point made with the prosecution is they apprehend and if an adversary hearing is afforded that the film might be shift out of the jurisdiction, edited or altered before the adversary hearing to be concluded and they say that the adversary hearing just won't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.206" offset="11748185">We might point out that these figures can be made by protective orders of the magistrate, subject to the sanction of contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.654" offset="11782040">I'll give example, in Texas the legislature has expressly authorized protective orders to prevent a film from moving from the jurisdiction or alteration and a knowing violation of these orders is made a separate offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.931" offset="11839091">And courts have consistently indicated that compact designed to subvert or bypass administration of justice will not be permitted merely because obscenity litigation may involve the sensitive procedural tools of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.512" offset="11905442">The report of the President's Commission on obscenity and points – arbitrarily points out that legislation can be drafted to require an exhibitor or distributor to make a film available for judicial hearing by permitting it's exhibition pending that hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.745" offset="11974301">The adoption of such legislation consists of a local practice would appear warranted and jurisdiction to which it may continue to seek to prosecute film exhibitors for adults, contrary to the commission's recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.561" offset="12025605">The commission proposed a model declaratory judgment and injunction statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.520" offset="12041488">It provides whenever material is being disseminated in violation of this obscenity laws, the state may bring several action against the disseminators in order to obtain a declaration that the dissemination was prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.469" offset="12089240">We say that the requirement of an adversary hearing will work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.053" offset="12119542">Application to be made for preliminary injunction after notice to the adverse party an opportunity for him to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.241" offset="12152351">The court could grant an ex parte restraining order to control any real threat of editing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.177" offset="12172100">The order can direct the exhibitor to keep and maintain the film within the jurisdiction and keep it in intact and order -- and enjoin the exhibitor from altering any part of it and it can punish violations of those orders by contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.923" offset="12243048">There is nothing we say to prevent diligent state prosecutor from executing adversary proceedings before judicial officer through notice to the distributor and a subpoena duces tecum directed to advert the (Inaudible) challenged publication and following judicial determination of obscenity the State authorities may seize and prosecute if the publications and materials are put on sale and this is very clear where a state procedure is (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.366" offset="12356838">The prosecution contends that it is significant that the petitioner did not move or return of the film, so that he might continue to show it, at the theater and we did not think this is significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.882" offset="12402918">Clearly the prosecution must proceed about the injunctive process or in some combination of manner which will afford an opportunity for the prior adversary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.279" offset="12456521">It's not up to the defendant to seek return of the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.849" offset="12466761">At the Trial Court hearing it sustained his motion to suppress return of the film necessarily would violate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.409" offset="12489017">The burden is on the prosecution to show the (Inaudible) to keep it and return of the film in any event is not an adequate remedy because it, there is not the restrain which is already occurred up until the time the film is ordered to return.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.118" offset="12551816">The Quantity of Books case I believe makes it clear that the adversary hearing must precede seizure in order to protect the right to circulate non-obscene material and again the prosecution's argument has not taken into account the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures for which the only adequate redress is exclusion of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.815" offset="12658604">Exclusion of the evidence were compelled respect for the constitutional guarantee and the only effective way as set this Court Mapp versus Ohio by removing the incentive to disregard it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.920" offset="12711058">And even if the film was returned officers are still going on keep on seizing films knowing that if return is ordered, the provision then a copy be made available ultimately they still get the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.232" offset="12760273">The return of the film proposal secures to the state the fruits of the poisonous tree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.642" offset="12781902">It was illegal seizure that is started the process of -- which led to obtaining the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.663" offset="12818056">My time is up, Your Honor.</text>
