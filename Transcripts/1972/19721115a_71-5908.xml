            <label>Mr. Peter Westen</label>
            <text syncTime="36.922" offset="251068">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.121" offset="263816">The petitioner in this case, Leon Chambers was convicted of a murder which another man was seen committing and towards that other man spontaneously and repeatedly confessed within hours of the shooting.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.852" offset="318777">The case presents two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.500" offset="325360">First, whether Chambers has a right under the constitution to introduce the other man's confessions to prove he is innocent and second, whether Chambers has a right under the constitution to cross-examine the other man and to impeach him for repudiating his confession in court and denying that he had anything to do with the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.374" offset="424835">The case began with a shooting that it took place at night during a racial disturbance in June, 1969 in the town of Woodville, Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.922" offset="467048">The victim was a policeman named Aaron Liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.823" offset="482617">Liberty and other policemen were confronting an angry crowd of about 50 blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.523" offset="505501">As Liberty faced the crowd, he was suddenly shot four times in the back.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.384" offset="528906">The bullets came from a 22-caliber gun from somewhere in the alley behind him.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.593" offset="549700">As he died, he turned and shot both barrels of his riot gun into the alley.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.443" offset="573106">The first shot passed over the heads of the crowd, the second shot hit a man, who by then was running down the alley.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.287" offset="604557">That man was the petitioner, Leon Chambers.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.076" offset="619708">Chambers was left in the alley severely wounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.139" offset="631933">When the police had gone, he was taken to a local hospital where two days later, he was placed under-arrest for the murder of Aaron Liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.777" offset="670490">Chambers insisted from the outset that he was innocent and that the state had arrested the wrong man.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.344" offset="700792">Indeed, within hours of shooting, another man Gable McDonald spontaneously confessed on separate occasions to three different people that he was the one who shot officer Liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.026" offset="747499">He first confessed to Berkley Turner, who left the scene of the shooting with him, that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.457" offset="781249">He next confessed to Sam Hardin who he had known all of his life and who drove him home on the night of the shooting.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.995" offset="823359">He confessed the next day to Albert Carter, his next door neighbor whom he had known for at least 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.865" offset="858781">Four months later, McDonald repeated his confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.493" offset="877380">He dictated it in the presence of a Minister and signed it under oath, it was detailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.502" offset="901413">He said that he shot officer Liberty at close range from the mouth of the alley.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.645" offset="925968">He said that he used his own nine-shot 22-caliber pistol which he discarded after the shooting.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.685" offset="954075">He said that he was confessing because it was no secret any longer that he was the one that shot Liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.175" offset="984064">He said that he was telling the truth, but admitted that he would be afraid to testify in court.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="226.554" offset="1009560">Mr. Westen, does the record show what has happened to Gable McDonald then?</text>

          <turn speaker="peter_westen" startTime="234.271" stopTime="316.841">
            <label>Mr. Peter Westen</label>
            <text syncTime="234.271" offset="1040488">Gable McDonald had a preliminary hearing, one month after he signed his written confession for justice of the peace who after a few days of deliberation, dismissed the charges against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.159" offset="1107989">One year later, Chambers himself went to trial for the murder of Aaron Liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.890" offset="1126902">He based this defense on showing that he was innocent and that it was not he but McDonald who killed Liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.729" offset="1162324">The evidence against Chambers is practically nonexistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.579" offset="1177684">One witness testified that he was watching Chambers at the time of the shooting, and could swear that Chambers did not shoot Liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.377" offset="1216867">Three policemen who were on the scene; one who was standing only two yards from Chambers and another who was standing four yards from Chambers and watching him at the time, denied seeing Chambers shoot Liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.291" offset="1272560">The police testified also that despite diligence search, they never found the murder weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.595" offset="1301713">There was evidence also in the record of the Chamber -- there was no evidence in the record that Chambers had ever owned a 22-caliber gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.058" offset="1331597">It is true that one witness, a policeman, the one who was standing farthest from Chambers, testified that he saw Chamber shoot Liberty.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="316.841" offset="1370781">Was there any evidence offered that McDonald ever owned a gun like this?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_westen" startTime="322.715" stopTime="336.559">
            <label>Mr. Peter Westen</label>
            <text syncTime="322.715" offset="1394186">Yes, the record showed that he had purchased before the shooting a 9-shot .22-caliber pistol and that he purchased shortly after the shooting, a second .22 caliber pistol.</text>

            <text syncTime="336.559" offset="1449566">At what stage in the process of the proposed impeachment was that evidence offered?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_westen" startTime="342.410" stopTime="495.538">
            <label>Mr. Peter Westen</label>
            <text syncTime="342.410" offset="1472972">That was offered as part of the defendant's affirmative case.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.591" offset="1497736">The defendant called a witness who sold the two guns to Gable McDonald in Natchez, Mississippi and we had federal fire arms records.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.091" offset="1559698">I was saying that there was one eyewitness, a policeman who testified that he saw Chamber shoot Liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.328" offset="1596688">But, the record also shows that neither that policeman nor any other policeman even searched Chambers who was lying at the most 20-25 feet from them after he was shot and that, that same policeman spent the next day asking members of the Black community if they knew who shot Liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.258" offset="1680384">As for Chamber's affirmative case, which is the issue here, he moved first to introduce McDonald's oral confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.676" offset="1718105">The confession was spontaneous, they were independent of one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.143" offset="1731897">They were uttered on the scene of the -- they were uttered within hours of the shooting.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.043" offset="1751542">They were made to friends of his and the people who had themselves witnessed the shooting.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.989" offset="1775365">Furthermore, the confessions were corroborated by eye-witness testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.639" offset="1789889">One witness testified that he saw McDonald shoot Liberty, another testified that he saw McDonald immediately after the shooting carrying a pistol.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.838" offset="1830745">As I said before, there was evidence that McDonald had owned two .22 caliber pistols.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.073" offset="1859688">One that he had purchased before the shooting and another that he had purchased immediately thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.306" offset="1880586">Nonetheless, when Chambers called Sam Hardin and Berkley Turner as defense witnesses, the trial court excluded, prevented them from discussing McDonald's confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.880" offset="1934921">He excluded the confessions on the ground that declarations against penal interest are hearsay and inadmissible in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.791" offset="1970552">Chambers then moved to introduce McDonald's written confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.872" offset="1986853">For that purpose, he called McDonald as a defense witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.172" offset="2004093">He had no illusions at that point that McDonald would be a friendly witness, because of McDonald's own preliminary hearing long before the trial, McDonald had repudiated his confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.993" offset="2047352">But Chambers called him for the purpose of authenticating the confession and laying a basis for introducing it and he examined McDonald for that purpose only.</text>
