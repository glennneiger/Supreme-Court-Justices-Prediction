            <text syncTime="49.747" offset="302373">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.183" offset="320136">In the present fluid state of our law, court spend a good deal of time going over all ground, that is the situation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.702" offset="378232">The case is here on certiorari to review a judgment of the Court of Claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.845" offset="414804">The suit there was begun by the administrators of the estate of Rose Mason, who was a restricted Osage Indian, acting pursuant to this Court’s decision in West against the Oklahoma Tax Commission in 334 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.611" offset="505814">The Osage agency of the Department of the Interior filed an Oklahoma estate tax return on her estate and paid the tax due.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.057" offset="559626">The claim in the suit in the court below is that this payment though in conformity with a decision of this Court conceded to be squarely in point and not overruled, was in fact a breach of trust, because the United States should have known that the West case would be overruled by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.208" offset="680208">The Court of Claim so held and held the United States liable to the estate for the amount of the tax paid.</text>

            <text syncTime="161.923" offset="751052">Yes Mr. Chief Justice, I think that's true, but I suppose that's almost always true with respect to a trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.944" offset="779160">If there is a decision 20 years old, maybe there are various things which might have happened, and he ought to present it to a court again.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.607" offset="821791">I think that the question of the duty of a subordinate agency of the United States to question decision of this Court ought not to arise to the dignity of a breach of trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.825" offset="890650">At any rate, that's the issue in this case.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="199.822" offset="902666">Mr. Solicitor General does the record show the approximate size of the decedent’s estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.977" offset="927326">I take if the tax, the state tax was $8,000, but which would indicate a very substantial estate as I recall the estate inherent --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="214.693" stopTime="504.803">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="214.693" offset="962121">I believe that the items are indicated on Page 6 of the Appendix and they would appear on a quick addition to come to about a $125,000 for the estate, Osage headrights 48,000, security of sales and trust 19,000, surplus trust funds 48,000 and two other items.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.270" offset="1064417">On the quick adding I get something like a $120,000-125,000, on which the tax paid was $7,700.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.386" offset="1116871">The United Stated brought Oklahoma into the case there as a third-party defendant and the court below also held that Oklahoma was liable to the United States in the amount of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.806" offset="1170578">Both Oklahoma and the United have sought review of this decision, and I shall appear for a 20 minutes and Mr. Duncan representing Oklahoma will use the other 10 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.230" offset="1224286">In order to determine whether the United States committed a breach of trust it will be necessary to review some decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.838" offset="1262738">Now, there are three decisions of this Court which are particularly relative.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.168" offset="1291995">The first of these decided 30 years ago, Oklahoma Tax Commission against the United States, an opinion by Justice Black dealt with restricted Osage property, and although the United Stated appeared there and vigorously contended as it shown by the brief file, that the restricted Osage property was not subject to Oklahoma inheritance tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.683" offset="1414144">This Court reviewed the situation, concluded that there was nothing in the Osage Allotment Act which a established a tax exemption and directly held that the restricted property was subject to Oklahoma inheritance tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.378" offset="1492929">Justice Murphy dissented in was one of the dissenters in that case, but just five years later there came up the case of West against the Oklahoma Tax Commission in 334 U.S. where Justice Murphy wrote the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.759" offset="1566386">That case involved property held in trust for an Osage Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.497" offset="1593344">Identical types of property to that which is involved here, item by item, the same types of property, trust property and the Court again, revealing the situation, held that the Oklahoma inheritance tax was applicable to property held in trust by the United States for an Osage Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.981" offset="1707342">It was less than eight years later that third of these cases came to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.746" offset="1730330">Now that is Squire against Capoeman in 351 U.S, an opinion by Chief Justice Warren.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.449" offset="1769200">That case involved Quinaielt Indians in the Sate of Washington under a different statued, the General Allotment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.915" offset="1803055">It was an income tax case not an inheritance tax case; it was a federal income tax case, where the guardian was seeking to take a tax from the words property and it was a tax on capital gain derived from the sale of timber on the Indians land when the timber constituted the only substantial value of those lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.813" offset="1914650">And the court and Squire and Capoeman held that that federal income tax was not due.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.026" offset="1947460">I think it can surely be said though that the Squire court did not understand that it was overruling the West case nor was its decision so understood by others at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.673" offset="2002108">It can be said that the approach of the Court in the West case -- in the Squire case was not wholly consistent with that of the Court in the West case.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.451" offset="2053204">But the cases were distinguishable as I have said, west was an inheritance tax case or Squire was an income tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.305" offset="2096567">West involved a state tax or Squire involved a federal tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="532.197" offset="2232195">The obligation to return the property, I forgot the exact word I was about to say undiminished, but I am not sure that is --</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="551.706" offset="2310248">The obligation to return the property and a provision that the property should be subject to taxation after a certain date which carried an implication that it was not subject to taxation beforehand.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.563" offset="2369599">The Court of Claims relied on certain subsequent developments, a decision in the Court of Claims in Big Eagle against the United States in 300 Federal Section 19 -- F. 2nd 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.426" offset="2433128">That was a federal income tax case and the Court of Claims held that the Squire case meant that the federal income tax could not be collected from trust property, such as is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.526" offset="2493524">And there is a later case in 1968 called Beartrack against the United States, where the United States settled by payment in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.302" offset="2532603">I don't want to suggest that there was a compromise, because of doubt about liability, settled by payment in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.868" offset="2558830">A federal estate tax case involving Osage property, and finally after the text was paid here, and incidentally the Beartrack case was after most of the tax was paid here.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.930" offset="2619120">In Revenue Ruling 69-164 in 1969, the Treasury issued a ruling that Osage trust property is not subject to the federal estate tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.315" offset="2684635">Whether these actions were right or wrong, they did not deal directly with the question of the liability of the estate of an Osage Indian or estate inheritance taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.428" offset="2741060">Moreover they were actions taken by the Treasury and the Justice Departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.932" offset="2767078">Now, the government is necessarily large in complex with many subdivisions of responsibilities and it is asking a lot through a subordinate office of the Interior Department in Oklahoma to keep abreast of these developments in other departments on a matter not directly in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.111" offset="2847848">Now this Court had decided the West case.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.900" offset="2863000">This was known to the appropriate officers of the Interior Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.637" offset="2881912">They acted accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.749" offset="2890376">They ought to be able to rely on a decision of this Court, which has not been overruled nor even remotely questioned here.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.936" offset="2927156">In this connection I would like to call attention to the decisions of this Court just three weeks ago yesterday in McClanahan against the Arizona State Tax Commission and the Mescalero Apache Tribe against Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.665" offset="3013987">Not only do these cases show the extreme complexity and uncertainty of the field of state taxation of Indians, but in the Mescalero case, this Court, on Page 11, cited Oklahoma Tax Commission against the United States and Squire against Capoeman in the same paragraph indeed back-to-back it might be said.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.718" offset="3122239">Now Oklahoma Tax Commission was the case on which the West decision is based and it hardly seems likely that this Court three weeks ago contemplated that Squired had overruled Oklahoma Tax Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.676" offset="3194128">Squire is a case to be dealt with, of course, but it's a federal income tax case involving a very special kind of income tax, a capital gains tax, imposed on the realization of most of the value of the Indians’ property by the sale of the timber which gave it its value.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.522" offset="3277511">Oklahoma Tax Commission and West involve a estate inheritance tax often treated differently from an income tax as in the case, for example, of the federal estate tax as applied to the transfer of state municipal bonds where the income is not taxable, but the Court, over a period of 75 years, has held that a transfer tax on death can properly be collected, or so a responsible officer in the Osage agency in Oklahoma might have understood and felt and acted accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.521" offset="3437484">By appropriate standards of the law of trust this was not a breach of trust, we contend, and the United States should not have been held liable for complying with a decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.166" offset="3488057">The liability imposed here is so novel that we have not been able to find trust decisions directly in point, but we have cited Professors Scott’s strides and we believe it supports our position that the Court of Claims went too far in finding liability here.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.116" offset="3567888">Of course if the United States is liable, we support the decision below in holding that Oklahoma is liable to indemnify the United States as a third-party defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.456" offset="3629223">The ultimate question here, of course, is whether West should be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.806" offset="3658585">On that question I find myself in a dilemma where the United States is trustee for the Indians and I am obligated to represent the Indians as I did here last Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.555" offset="3717622">And the United States is been held liable and has tax revenues taken the general situation, and I am obligated to represent the United States in the capacity too.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.738" offset="3770284">In private practice when such a conflict of interest develops, a lawyer must withdraw from one of the representations.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.279" offset="3812498">Now that is not so easy in public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.239" offset="3828276">We have only limited authority to retain outside counsel and even if such counsel were retained they would still be subject to the overall authority of the Attorney General and the conflict would remain.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.309" offset="3884596">It is inherent in the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.924" offset="3903091">The President has asked Congress to establish an Indian Trust Council Authority, which would resolve this particular problem, but this is not been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.269" offset="3952410">It has been suggested that the Solicitor General might ask various interested agencies of the government to file briefs or to incorporate the view of the different agencies in a single brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.846" offset="4006745">It is not clear though that this would always meet the responsibility of the Solicitor General to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.221" offset="4036211">For one of the functions of this Solicitor General, I suppose, is to reconcile and ajust diversion views of government officers, and so far as possible to present a single view to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.709" offset="4094203">Now this area can be one of great difficulty, where there are often widely diversion views with respect to Indian problems depending on whether one looks at it solely from the point of view of the Indians or whether he seeks to deal with and to reconcile as far as possible many competing governmental interests, such as the taxing power or the law of governmental instrumentalities or the responsibility for the enforcement of criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.462" offset="4233174">In many cases it has been possible to work these things out and to present a unified view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.726" offset="4262327">That was done, for example, McClanahan and Mescalero.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.903" offset="4286986">In another cases the difficulties have been acute as in the Agua Caliente case where the Court asked the Solicitor General to state his views and he did so, although endeavoring to make it plain that his view was not shared by some other officers of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.320" offset="4368697">In this case we have filed a brief in which we have endeavored the state both sides as fairly and evenly as possible without taking an official position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.811" offset="4422614">Consequently on this final question I ask the Court to consider the materials in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.138" offset="4455946">If the time has come when West should be overruled, this Court is the place where that action should be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.615" offset="4489801">If the West Case can still stand, it would be helpful if this Court would state that effect and in terms which would indicate whether the decision is applicable to federal income and the state taxes as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="1949.956" offset="7903169">One point brought up by the Solicitor General, I would like to reply to immediately and that is, he referred to conflict of interest in the government when it comes to representing questions of Indian rights as are raised in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.524" offset="7961475">He said that some times it’s possible to solve the problem by reaching an accommodation between divergent views of agencies of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.984" offset="7995329">That is a perfectly correct, tenable way to handle divergences among the various agencies, which are not trusties of the Indians but ones you see the government were in the half of the trustee, of the Indians, there is no substitute for a separate voice speaking for the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.233" offset="8064293">This could be done by hiring special counsel or it could be done as the Solicitor General referred as presenting two different views in one brief and that was done in Steven’s case in the Ninth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2006.854" offset="8130748">Does that really solve, in a technical sense, the conflict problem, because the special counsel would still be speaking for the United States, the same United States that his trustee is, is that not so?</text>

            <text syncTime="2019.617" offset="8181844">The same problem occurs in the public defender area where the government employs both sides of the fence there, but I think we are used the accepting the loyalty, diverging loyalty of the both sides of the counsel there, and I think that could grow up with respect to Indian rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.562" offset="8253628">Our basic theme is that the West case was good law -- well never was good law, but was entitled to be followed until 1956 when Capoeman overruled it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2058.290" offset="8336488">Capoeman did so by implication and so we say that when Capoeman made its ruling, it related back to West and declared West in the case it in turn defended on Oklahoma Tax Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="2688.906" offset="10858977">The -- to me the critical fact to keep in mind when you are considering the West case and the Oklahoma Tax Commission case is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.125" offset="10895862">When this court made that decision involving state taxes, it was assumed by everyone that this Indian property was subject to Federal Estate and Income taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.667" offset="10950092">This Court had held and superintendent in five tribe's case in 1935 in a broad general statement, not subject to qualification that Indians pay income taxes on their trust property unless there is an express exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.522" offset="11005471">This was taken to mean and later held to mean that Indians pay taxes like everyone else unless there is an express exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.885" offset="11034937">By 1943 when Oklahoma tax Commission case came up, it was generally assumed and not doubted and the Internal Revenue Service was collecting on this assumption that Federal taxes were correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.191" offset="11088123">Now this Court or any other tribunal would have a very hard time finding the state taxes should not lie if Federal taxes would lie and the Court at that time was assuming a federal taxes did lie.

            <text syncTime="2985.013" offset="12043473">There should because no question that the death is not significant in the impact of this tax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.379" offset="12072939">Exemption carries forward, it bridges the death and goes until the heir becomes competent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.908" offset="12098957">This is clear from the language of the General Allotment Act which says that the United State shall hold this land in trust for the Indian or in case he dies, his heir until becomes competent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.229" offset="12140335">And it's also expressly so in the Osage Allotment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.805" offset="12154546">In our brief, in footnote on page 11, we cite four of the many references to the concern that Congress cottage had for the heirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.208" offset="12192162">Furthermore the West and Oklahoma Tax Commission cases when they say, if this property is exempt from direct tax, then it is exempt from death tax, sort of forecloses that question we feel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.187" offset="12244093">We feel that the Capoeman has proved that these properties are exempt from direct taxes and that therefore under West and Oklahoma Tax Commission, there aren't any overruling at all, they are still good law when they say that therefore no death tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.208" offset="12300204">So we don't think that the death is relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.933" offset="12311071">But back to the General Allotment Act, the trust relationship, determination of the trust when the Indian became competent, the freedom from the charge of incumbency, this Court held in Capoeman, may will be sufficient to support the tax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.694" offset="12382124">Now there was more in the Capoeman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.440" offset="12393096">Now the General Allotment Act was passed in 1887.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.629" offset="12409919">The Osages weren't allotted and incidentally the Osages were left out of the General Allotment Act by a fluke.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.576" offset="12433638">The General Allotment Act was supposed to fly to all Indians in the country with a few exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.380" offset="12452864">And those exceptions were the Indians who held their lands in fee and the Osages were believed to own their lands in fee, but because they were in Oklahoma, but unlike any other tribe in Oklahoma they didn't, their lands were in trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.838" offset="12514722">Therefore the Osages were not under the General Allotment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.523" offset="12529455">In 1903 this Court held that when the General Allotment Act exempts land from levy, attachment or the charge of incumbency, that means tax exemption, that was the Rickert case 1903.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.394" offset="12592985">Now, the next thing that happens is in 1906.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.904" offset="12603016">Congress amends the General Allotment Act and it says that, for the first time adds the idea that the trust period can end sooner that the 25 years extended, if the Indian becomes competent sooner than that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.640" offset="12669889">And it says, “after he reaches the point of competency, the trust will end and he gets his land and all restrictions as to alienation and taxation are lifted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.222" offset="12708237">Now, this implies that Congress thought that the land was free of tax after that point and well so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.961" offset="12731225">Only three years ago this Supreme Court in 1903 had held restriction on alienation added up to a tax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.434" offset="12761109">So Congress assumed on very good authority in 1906 that the restriction on alienation was equivalent of a tax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.158" offset="12796008">Now when we come to the Osage Allotment Act also in 1906, we have Congress very much aware of all this at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.187" offset="12824116">Congress says that the Osage property, the tribal land will be alloted to the individual Osages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.367" offset="12848880">They will pick 160 acres of land and that's going to be tax exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.122" offset="12863822">The rest of their land which would be several hundred acres, Congress said will be taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.243" offset="12880332">Congress expressly said that this land would be taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.471" offset="12893288">Now the implication is that when Congress doesn't say the Osage property is taxable then it isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.040" offset="12915545">When it came to the minerals, it wasn't was to just divide up the minerals along with the surface rights, so what they did was they took they whole mineral estate as if it were a single body or reservation, held in trust for the Osage tribe and alloted the minerals by allotting head rights to the individual Osages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.113" offset="12995793">Now each head right just like the General Allotment Act was to be inalienable until the Indian became competent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.413" offset="13020975">The parallelism is compelling.</text>
