            <label>Mr. Moses Lasky</label>
            <text syncTime="27.227" offset="212302">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.774" offset="226513">The issue in this case can be stated quite quickly and quite succinctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.672" offset="246053">It is a question of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.725" offset="258278">It can be stated this way, “Does the Court of Appeals have jurisdiction under the Interlocutory Appeals Act of 1958 to entertain an interlocutory appeal in a Government civil antitrust case or has that appeal been precluded by the much earlier Expediting Act of 1903.”</text>
            <text syncTime="61.696" offset="350124">Now the Act of 1958 was of course a revolutionary act because it was the customary and traditional animosity of the law to interlocutory appeals that had been existed from time immemorial, first broken through in the Evarts Act of 1891 to have interlocutory appeals on the injunctive orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.517" offset="437478">In 1958, as a result of the experience of judges, and administrative office of the courts, the Interlocutory Appeals Act was enacted because it was believed there were situations where an interlocutory appeal could be very helpful in speeding along the law in situation of both the District Judge certified the cases in appropriate one and the Court of Appeals felt the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="115.988" offset="567359">Oh!</text>
            <text syncTime="116.182" offset="568090">Yes and our Court of Appeals here did not pass upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.423" offset="585017">It simply said it had no jurisdiction even to consider the matter.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="124.685" stopTime="129.149">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="124.685" offset="602154">Broadly, they did not feel the same way about it for different reasons?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="moses_lasky" startTime="129.149" stopTime="510.015">
            <label>Mr. Moses Lasky</label>
            <text syncTime="129.149" offset="619917">They didn't consider the matter on its merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.943" offset="631097">Now this case the present case would, if the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction, have been the perfect textbook example of an appropriate case for an interlocutory appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.187" offset="680103">Now the question on which the interlocutory appeal was certified by the District Court was a sharp, simple and controlling question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.908" offset="711032">This suit had been filed in 1966 to enjoin acquisition by Phillips Petroleum Company of certain of the assets in the West of Tidewater Oil Company charging that it would violate Clayton Act, Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.046" offset="767561">After extensive hearings, taking of evidence, the District Court had denied a restraining order, denied a preliminary injunction and the parties although the closing date had come, did not consummate the case could deferred -- doing anything at all until the District Court had denied the restraint and injunction and then the transaction was consummated, the sale was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.211" offset="864214">The case then proceeded for the next five years as one for divestiture against Phillips Petroleum.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.743" offset="886366">And the seller, my client, Tidewater remained in the case passively except to respond to all discovery, and then when discovered was completed and the government announced it was ready to go to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.914" offset="935058">Tidewater moved to dismiss the action as against it on the simple legal proposition that Section 7 is not aimed at the seller, but is directed solely at the buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.576" offset="981661">That was a clean cut proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.619" offset="989811">If we were correct that prevented the cases to Tidewater and as the trial judge said that the case would be a different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.251" offset="1020426">The district judge, this time a different district judge denied the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.387" offset="1036936">Our motion to be dismissed but being doubtful of the correctness of his decision, he volunteered to certify for interlocutory appeal or in the alternative suggested that would mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.174" offset="1088031">Well mandamus was of course not an open remedy because the court had jurisdiction to decide what the laws meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.111" offset="1115826">He had jurisdiction to misconstrue the law, so mandamus was not over.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.685" offset="1138082">Now, we did hereupon petitioned the Ninth Circuit within the time allowed by the Act for an interlocutory appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.922" offset="1167026">That court held that it lacked jurisdiction and it held that the Expediting Act of 1903 precluded it from having jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.411" offset="1209031">It did saw however solely upon the basis of authorities having to do with the jurisdiction of a Court of Appeals to entertain an appeal from orders granting or denying interlocutory injunctions and that has a wholly different history as I will suggest and indicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.694" offset="1282173">Now the case is here before this Court because of the conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.999" offset="1299414">The Ninth and the District of Columbia circuits both in the same quick decision cited some authorities that held that Court of Appeals lacks jurisdiction under the Interlocutory Appeals Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.062" offset="1351659">The Seventh Circuit in a very careful opinion has held that Court of Appeals do possess jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.339" offset="1376737">And thereupon, this Court having denied my petition for certiorari, granted it upon a petition for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.910" offset="1407039">Now the place to start analysis I would assume must be the text of two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.491" offset="1429295">If it isn't the place to end it now, this is certainly the place to start analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.354" offset="1448835">The Interlocutory Appeals Act of 1958 states in the plaintiffs possible language, “that in a civil action, an interlocutory appeal to a Court of Appeals may be taken, if the District Court makes a certain certification on the Court of Appeals and its discretionary permits.”</text>
            <text syncTime="354.097" offset="1519783">In other words, in a civil action are all comprehensive, they are unlimited as to type of suit, there are unlimited as to litigant.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.109" offset="1551757">On the other hand, the Expediting Act which was enacted of course 55 years earlier says nothing at all about interlocutory appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.834" offset="1586657">There is not a word in it about the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.434" offset="1597106">It simply says, “That an appeal from the final judgment” and “in the Government civil antitrust suit will lie only to this Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="383.741" offset="1638379">Now as the Seventh Circuit very closely observed if these two acts had been enacted by Congress simultaneously, the language of each could have been given effect without limiting the scope of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.505" offset="1689370">And it is of course the fundamental principle that of statutory construction that where there are two acts effect should be given to each, if possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.675" offset="1730121">Now as the Seventh Circuit commented, there is entirely different language with respect to interlocutory appeals from injunctive orders, that goes back to the Evarts Act of 1891.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.608" offset="1785814">And what the Evarts Act said was that an interlocutory appeal on injunctive orders can be taken to a Court of Appeals if that court has the jurisdiction to hear an appeal from the final judgment, that was in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.514" offset="1853419">So that what when in 1903, the Expediting Act was passed which said that appeals from final judgments as its language in Government civil antitrust cases lay to this Court alone, that class of cases seize to be the class of cases to that the Evarts Act had to do with by its express language.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.766" offset="1938474">Now over the years, there has been -- there have been revisions in the language of the Evarts Act, revisions of amendments and codifications, finally getting into the judicial code in 1948 and as a result there has been debate whether the Court of Appeals can entertain an appeal from interlocutory injunctive order as of right and again there is a conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.060" offset="2027604">The Ninth Circuit and one of the other circuits holds no and the First Circuit held yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.436" offset="2053099">And that question has never reached this Court because it was never to anybody's interest to bring it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.930" offset="2075042">Now I am not debating that line of decisions here, it's not the problem we are dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.416" offset="2096985">We're dealing here with the right to interlocutory appeal not as of right but discretionary under the Act of 1958.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="510.015" stopTime="513.309">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="510.015" offset="2143483">You are speaking discretionary to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in this one?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="moses_lasky" startTime="513.309" stopTime="844.938">
            <label>Mr. Moses Lasky</label>
            <text syncTime="513.309" offset="2156648">Oh!</text>
            <text syncTime="513.486" offset="2157275">Yes and that if the Court please is why I do not ask this Court to determine whether the appeal should be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.635" offset="2189876">I merely ask this Court to tell the Ninth Circuit that it has jurisdiction to consider that question and to remand this case to the Ninth Circuit to exercise its discretion and to determine whether we should have an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.901" offset="2238986">It's well established I think that if lower court denies that it has jurisdiction and therefore refuses to exercise it this Court can tell it you do have jurisdiction now exercise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.773" offset="2286425">What the Ninth Circuit might do to my petition for leave to appeal when we get back is an open question, but it's not a question I can present to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.913" offset="2322996">Now the government's argument here has been that the Expediting Act is a special act and that 1958 Interlocutory Appeals Act is a general act and that a later general is not repeal an earlier special act unless it is very specific, but the error in that argument is that both acts are special acts and the Act of 1958 repeals nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.223" offset="2448280">I would say they are both special acts in this sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.027" offset="2459460">The Expediting Act of 1903 is a special act dealing with the problem of appeal from a final judgment in a specific kind of case, Government civil antitrust.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.792" offset="2506585">The Interlocutory Appeals Act of 1958 is a special act dealing with the right to take interlocutory appeals in all kinds of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.825" offset="2550680">No repeal of the Expediting Act is involved here because as I have already suggested to the Court the Expediting Act is nothing about interlocutory appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.758" offset="2594356">Now the reason, the reason why before 1958 there was no right to an interlocutory appeal in a Government antitrust case was not that the Expediting Act prohibited it, but because there was no act of Congress which authorized it.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.501" offset="2665409">Prior to 1891 there was no act that authorized any interlocutory appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.893" offset="2682964">Then we had an act that authorized interlocutory appeals on injunctive orders to a court that had a jurisdiction over the final appeal, but not until 1958 that any kind of law or statute authorize interlocutory appeal from a different character.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.706" offset="2746180">So the Act of 1958 repeals nothing, it added something brand new to the law, something which the courts have felt would be useful and I have cited in the brief, a statement from the Harvard Journal on legislation that the Judgment of the Congress that the Interlocutory Appeals Act would expedite litigation have proved to be sound from experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.224" offset="2832280">Now we come then to this question, that government has relied primarily on dictum, language of Justice Brandeis in United States versus California Canneries, the famous language and I will read those two sentences because this what the case has been made to turn on by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.327" offset="2952652">He said the court referring to the provisions concerning appeal prior to the Expediting Act, these provisions governing appeals in general were amended by the Expediting Act so that the suit in equity under the Antitrust Act “In which the United is complainant” the appeal should be direct to this Court from the final decree in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.566" offset="3041677">Thus Congress limited the right of review to an appeal from the decree which disposed of all matters and have precluded the possibility of an appeal to either court from an interlocutory decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.090" offset="3091728">That’s the language my adversary seeks to fasten on us as somehow disposing of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.871" offset="3118895">I have two observations I wish to make about that language and I believe both them are very (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="759.090" offset="3139688">First the court was not then laying down any rule of constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.770" offset="3166438">It says there cannot be interlocutory appeals and that everything must be decided on a final appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.521" offset="3189426">It was laying down no law of nature, some to use of expression of Mr. Justice Homes, some bruiting omni presence in the sky.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.860" offset="3222862">It was saying nothing about some immutable perpetual restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.080" offset="3239685">It was chief speaking about (Inaudible) legislative policy on the state of the statutes in 1925 and it was entirely correct in what it said because since Congress had made no provision for an interlocutory appeal and it provided that it could only -- the final appeal went to this Court it was correct there was no way to get an interlocutory appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.999" offset="3335398">Now the Interlocutory Appeals Act was enacted 55 years after the Expediting Act, about 30 years after the California Canneries case was a sharp break with former attitudes about desirability of interlocutory appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.858" offset="3398823">As I have already suggested it was a new departure manifesting erratically different attitude toward interlocutory appeals from the former antipathy.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.577" offset="3433723">And in the Canneries case this Court was at most expressing a judgment on what Congress had done, not on what Congress could do or what might be doing 30 years later.</text>

            <text syncTime="844.938" offset="3483146">The colloquy of course is -- this language was later coated in Brown Shoe?</text>

            <label>Mr. Moses Lasky</label>
            <text syncTime="853.075" offset="3515643">Now the point the Brown Shoe was that it was pure dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.115" offset="3531839">The question was not -- that was not the question in Brown Shoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.210" offset="3544168">The question in Brown Shoe was whether a decision by the trial court in an acquisition violated the law before it had created a remedy was sufficiently final to permit appeal to toll and the court held it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.895" offset="3602996">Then in a footnote, it had this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.551" offset="3613550">Now as to that of course it is well settled that not only the dictum is not binding, but statements made in a context in which the matter is not even before the court should not be given broad and exaggerated value.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.885" offset="3670915">Just the other day I said the other day, in May of this year in Kastigar versus the United States, visited here which is reported in 406 United States this Court observed that broad language, particularly in dictum and in the context of ancillary points, not essential to the decision of the court has no weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.754" offset="3754402">Now not only was Brown Shoe dictum where the Court wasn't dealing with the question, it wasn't presented to it for its consideration but what was said in the Canneries case on the subject was also a dictum, also a dictum for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.924" offset="3819081">There what was being appealed from was an order denying a motion for leave to intervene after a final decree, the United States versus Swift &amp; Company and it's settled law that a post judgment order on appeal from a post judgment order is not an interlocutory appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.470" offset="3901210">It itself is an appeal from a final order which this Court has held in El Paso case, one of the El Paso Natural Gas cases, well, settled at the time and most of Justice Brandeis’ opinion was pointing that out if that was a final order therefore the appeal lay only to that court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1024.301" offset="4200573">Secondly, that it was better to get the case into the hands of this Court and bypass the Courts of Appeal and as the Seventh Circuit remarked much more has been read into the Expediting Act then it actually contained.</text>

            <text syncTime="1198.931" offset="4899088">The procedure that I say submit the Interlocutory Appeals Act offers is that it can do the same here and I would submit that it would be extraordinarily useful if the courts below made greater use of this kind of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.194" offset="4960110">Now there are other arguments that have been presented by my adversaries and I approach the matter from a standpoint of responding to adversaries argument because it seems to me and as it seemed to the Seventh Circuit if you take the language of the statute on his face, it is plainly in favor of the interlocutory appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.340" offset="5048717">The only way adversaries read the language to eliminate that is to bring the bear upon an erroneous history which is -- or the history of interlocutory appeals from injunctive orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.041" offset="5103574">Now one other argument has been presented by Solicitor General's Office which is that interlocutory appeals from injunctive orders deserve, are more meritorious, and should be allowed more than interlocutory appeals of the discretionary type that the 1958 Act deals with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.078" offset="5199705">Of course that is a value judgment, they start with that premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.171" offset="5212035">And they say that no interlocutory appeal lies from an injunctive order in a Government antitrust suit and it would be very anomalous then to permit it to lie from another type of order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.069" offset="5267623">This is one of the major arguments made in the Solicitor General's brief and it has several flaws about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.629" offset="5293850">In first place, it is by no means clear that an injunction does -- an appeal does not lie form an interlocutory appeals injunctive order in a Government antitrust suit under 28 U.S.C. § 1292 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.504" offset="5353409">Now 1292 (a) is the old Evarts Act brought up to date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.129" offset="5367933">1292 (b) is the Interlocutory Appeals Act of 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.473" offset="5389249">There was a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.741" offset="5394369">Where you have an appeal under 1292 (a) it is as of right of injunctive orders, receiverships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.325" offset="5420701">To have an appeal under 1292 (b) it is a matter of joint discretion of the two lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.527" offset="5445465">Now it is not at all settled that there is no (Inaudible) as of right from an injunctive order because as I say there is a conflict between the circuits on that and this Court has never resolved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.579" offset="5489664">But assuming that you cannot have an appeal from an injunctive order as of right under 1292 (a) then you do have that right under 1292 (b) because 1292 (b) says, here is its language, “When a district judge in making in a civil action an order not otherwise appealable under this section” that’s 1292, “then the 1958 procedure applies.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.030" offset="5611499">So that the argument doesn’t hold up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.258" offset="5632397">I submit the matter in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.393" offset="5652982">The Interlocutory Appeals Act of 1958 was the combination of a growing feeling over the years with the old, hard rule against interlocutory appeals was injurious to the administration of justice and it opened it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.559" offset="5713586">The Interlocutory Appeals Act repealed nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.432" offset="5725080">It added something to the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.495" offset="5737305">On a face of the statute literally it allows an interlocutory appeal in any kind of civil case to a Court of Appeals if the two lower courts believe it isn't a appropriate case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1449.060" offset="5899577">Then had an order to -- in order to come in under 1292 (b) one would have to show that there is involved a controlling question of law upon which there is good grounds for dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.908" offset="5954957">I think and that the decision would expedite the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.834" offset="5970735">Those were the tests that have to be made under 1292 (b) that do not have to be made under 1292 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.642" offset="5993932">Now in how many injunction, preliminary injunction cases, matters that would -- you could meet those tests, I do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.347" offset="6024756">I think you might often be able to do so because an interlocutory injunction as was observed, I think by Mr. Justice Fortas in one of the cases in this Court, granted in a Section 7 case often has the effect of terminating the transaction and terminating litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.732" offset="6094346">So that I submit that the statute on its face allows an interlocutory appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.264" offset="6116394">I submit that the statute, so interpreted, so applied would go along way to alleviate the burden of this Court, would give the court the benefit of the screening action of the Court of Appeals and I do not dispute that Congress might well look at it again and determine what other relief would be in order, but that is no reason to spurn the relief which Congress has presently given to us.</text>

            <text syncTime="1537.845" offset="6254738">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.860" offset="6262784">Mr. Lasky is quite right in characterizing the issue here is one of the statutory interpretation somewhat complicated because here we have two statutes to interpret, the Expediting Act in 1903 and the interlocutory appeals and then the 1958, which is Section 1292 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.614" offset="6329866">Since we believe that the Expediting Act controls the decision in this case and that decision below should therefore be affirmed, I will begin with that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.492" offset="6365288">Section 2 of the Expediting Act provides and I quote “that in Government civil antitrust cases, an appeal from the final judgment of the district court will lie only to the Supreme Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.160" offset="6408025">SAC passed in 1903 had two basic purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.943" offset="6423176">One to eliminate the delay of intermediate appeals and two to ensure that this Court and only this Court would decide that the questions in the cases presented there in these cases because of their importance in order to and order to ensure nationwide uniformity in the interpretation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.691" offset="6502170">Now, accomplish -- Congress accomplished both of these objectives in the Act as it obvious from its terms include direct path from the District Court to this Court in final judgments, for review of final judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.654" offset="6550026">But it also precluded interlocutory appeals to the Courts of Appeals and it did this because of the time that was passed the Evarts Act as Mr. Lasky pointed out said that the Courts of Appeals had jurisdiction to review interlocutory appeals only in cases where they had jurisdiction to review the final judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1629.231" offset="6620348">Well, then was the Evarts Act and not the Expediting Act that precluded interlocutory appeals, wasn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1634.193" offset="6640097">Well, I think that question can be cleared up when I discuss the cases that have interpreted the Expediting Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.721" offset="6666219">If Congress wanted to do -- if Congress had the purpose of precluding intermediate appeals in the Expediting Act and we think it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.571" offset="6697671">It would have been just simply superfluous word to say and also we do not want any interlocutory appeals to take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.634" offset="6729958">It didn't have to say that because under the provisions of the Evarts Act there would be no interlocutory appeals once the Expediting Act was passed and that is why Congress when they gave this Court the jurisdiction over final judgments precluded interlocutory appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.138" offset="6791920">Now, over the years there has been a consistent interpretation of the Expediting Act to mean exactly what Congress intended to mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.602" offset="6825775">In 1929 Mr. Justice Brandeis stated for the Court that the Expediting Act had amended the provisions of the Evarts Act and he said, in the Expediting Act, Mr. Lasky pointed this also, Congress “limited the right of review to an appeal from a decree which disposed of all matters and precluded the possibility of an appeal either to this Court or to the Court of Appeals from an interlocutory decree.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.845" offset="6930787">And Mr. Lasky tells us that was difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.895" offset="6938937">Mr. Justice Brandeis who was noted for his sensitivity to jurisdiction, in pronouncing that statement, was not the holding of the Court and he tells us this because he says that in that case what we really had was a final judgment, but I think if this Court examines the opinion in California Canneries, they will notice that Mr. Justice Brandeis never did resolve whether the order being appealed from in that case was a final judgment or a final decree or an interlocutory decree, what decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.337" offset="7060668">What he said was it doesn't matter which it is because the Courts of Appeals had jurisdiction over neither.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.772" offset="7086477">15 years later, after the opinion in the California Canneries case, this Court decided a case entitled Allen Calculators which we have cited, I believe on the page 23 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.290" offset="7144573">In that case, the Court also relying on California Canneries and again -- again stated, “jurisdiction to review District Court decrees was not vested in the Circuit Courts of Appeals but solely in this Court and the Expediting Act, the Expediting Act limited the right of appeal to the final decrees,” not the Evarts Act, the Expediting Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.864" offset="7226807">Then surely they are after in two other cases in Alkali Exporters and in De Beers case both of which involved the review of interlocutory orders and Government civil antitrust cases by the common law writ of certiorari under the All Writs Act, the Court said that sole appellate jurisdiction in these kinds of cases lies in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.505" offset="7305383">It said the Expediting Act “permits appellate review of interlocutory orders only on appeal from final judgment” and it pointed out that the Act “manifests the plain indication of the legislative purpose to avoid piecemeal reviews.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.544" offset="7369540">This brings us to Brown Shoe decided in 1962, four years after the amendment to the interlocutory Appeals Act that Tidewater relies upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.285" offset="7412485">Mr. Chief Justice Warren for the majority cited Canneries and said that in the Expediting Act, Congress precluded appeals to this Court and to the Courts of Appeals from interlocutory decrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.973" offset="7463267">Mr. Lasky points out that 1292 (b) was not involved in Brown Shoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.268" offset="7480404">That is true, but what was involved in Brown Shoe was the question whether the decree in that case was a final judgment and one of the factors that motivated the Court to hold that it was a final judgment, was simply that if it was not, it was not appealable at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2061.199" offset="8348191">Tidewater's position amounts to this that although the Courts of Appeals have no jurisdiction to review final judgments in this case they may nevertheless cite controlling questions of law in Governments civil antitrust cases by reviewing interlocutory orders.</text>

            <text syncTime="2476.956" offset="10011146">Now, since 1963 Congress has been considering Bills to revise the Expediting Act and as we pointed out in our brief they came very close in the last Congress to giving a thorough revision to the Expediting Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.039" offset="10063496">And what they were about to do there was make it the basic rule that all these appeals will go to the Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.980" offset="10087320">The justice department supported this legislation, but then there would be an exception that after the final judgment of the District Court and if the Attorney General of the District Court certified that the case was of general public importance then there would be a direct appeal of this Court, but this Court would have discretion to refuse the appeal and remand the case of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.950" offset="10163179">The one provision that is being contained in every Bill before Congress since 1963 and these were cited in our brief, is dealing with interlocutory appeals and it says this that appeals shall be allowed under 1292 (a), but not otherwise and that's the bill that passed both houses of Congress last year and the reason for it is in the committee reports, I haven't cited this in our brief, but in the committee reports on the Bill that was in the last house of Congress that Congress thought it would be anomalous to have the Courts of Appeals deciding controlling questions of the law in a case where the direct appeal might go to the Supreme Court of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2594.107" offset="10479783">And we had -- we're given an expedite – well, first of all they did not even mention the Expediting Act in any of the history and what we have is a clear policy of the Expediting Act, includes interlocutory appeals and I think that unless Congress even deals with that question that a general statute can't repeal that Expediting Act provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.616" offset="10549791">But the rationalization that Tidewater gives is well what Congress wanted to do is save this Court a lot of time and wanted to reduce this Court's workload because of the direct appeals under the Expediting Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.042" offset="10595558">Well, the strange thing is that that's not mentioned at all in any of the commission -- committee reports, the hearings and anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.576" offset="10617710">But the interesting about it is, I fail to see how appeals under the interlocutory appeals provision is going to reduce this Court's workload one iota because the point is that no matter what the Court of Appeals decides when the interlocutory appeal, the number of cases where a direct appeal would lie remains the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="2898.967" offset="11699284">I think that is something that Congress has to consider, the possibility of too many certifications and therefore slowing down the disposition of these cases where time is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.188" offset="11732093">The cases do drag out over a number of years, but I think time is important in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.878" offset="11750902">Particularly when you have injunctions in effect or injunction is not which is a usual type situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.176" offset="11776084">And so I think in summary what it comes down to is this, that the system of the appellate review for Expediting Act cases that Tidewater envisages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.495" offset="11813386">With Circuit Courts of Appeals that have no jurisdiction to review final judgments passing on controlling questions of law is an anomaly in the federal appellate system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.829" offset="11846719">There is no other area of federal appellate law where that exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.537" offset="11865527">Now, Tidewater says, that's may be Congress experimented, but it seems strange that Congress did not even mention this, mentioned the possibility of this kind of system arising.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.146" offset="11900008">If it was attempting an experiment it did not even know what ingredients it was pouring into the brew.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.885" offset="11922892">And I think that in itself casts substantial doubt in the correctness of Tidewater's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.162" offset="11940028">And we add to this the fact there is no indication, whatsoever the Congress considered the Expediting Act or even considered in the revision of 1292 (b), the burdens on this Court and that it's doubtful at best that Tidewater's proposed scheme would even save this Court any trouble and that in a long series of cases from the Canneries case to Brown Shoe every Justice who has spoken on the matter said that the Expediting Act forbids interlocutory appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.380" offset="12052877">When you put all this together, we believe that there is no doubt that the court below correctly held that it didn't have jurisdiction over Tidewater's appeal and we think therefore that decision would be affirmed -- the decision below should be affirmed.</text>
