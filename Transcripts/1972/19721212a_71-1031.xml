            <text syncTime="5.410" offset="125053">I’m Robert Pirtle, attorney for the appellant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.819" offset="138637">This case comes to Court on appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.199" offset="156191">Part of the jurisdiction was noted on June 12, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.280" offset="172492">The facts in this case are relatively simple although complicated somewhat by later enacted legislation both by the State of Washington, the Colville Confederated Tribes and by later activities of the State and the appellant and the tribes and the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.837" offset="242709">We’ll begin here with the thorough recognition that Washington is Public Law 83-280 State.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.990" offset="267368">That is pursuant to that Act, it has taken jurisdiction, certain jurisdiction over Indians and Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.313" offset="304671">The reservation here is the Colville reservation in Eastern Washington comprising some 1.3 million acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.032" offset="331525">It is governed by a 14-member tribal council under a Constitution of by-laws approved by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.534" offset="365484">Leonard Tonasket, the appellant here is a full-blood Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.067" offset="379591">He is a direct descendant of Chief Tonasket of the Okanogan Band.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.092" offset="403728">In 1964, he borrowed some $6,000 of federally restricted funds with which to build a store on his trust allotment inside the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.450" offset="445210">That land was specifically approved by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.404" offset="460988">He made and additional loan of $800 to with which to purchase cigarette inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.273" offset="484498">That loan was also a federally restricted funds again approved by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.773" offset="510516">He operated his store selling cigarettes and sundries and Indian artifacts and clothing as a trader on the reservation but without a federal trader’s license.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.622" offset="553880">He did not collect tax for the State of Washington nor for the tribe at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.031" offset="575509">The State of Washington arrested him in 1967 and seized his cigarette inventory leaving the rest of his inventory intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.041" offset="611558">He then began this action inequity seeking a declaratory judgment as to his rights to make sales in the reservation on his trust land.</text>

            <text syncTime="156.331" offset="728691">The State Supreme Court ruled that Public Law 83-280 specifically granted the State complete jurisdiction over Indian trading with no exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.450" offset="765158">Now, the State of Washington in its briefs in this case is willing to concede that the State has no jurisdiction over trade with respect to Indians.</text>

            <text syncTime="196.344" offset="888769">We contend that sales from the Indian to the non-Indian on the reservation also come within that definition.</text>

            <text syncTime="551.417" offset="2308995">That is, does Public Law 83-280 constitute a grant of tax jurisdiction to the State?</text>
            <text syncTime="557.503" offset="2333341">The State Supreme Court says, “Yes, it constitutes a plenary grant of jurisdiction over Indians with only the exception set forth in 2 (b) and 4 (b) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.676" offset="2374092">The Court went further.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.986" offset="2379316">It said it constitutes a complete grant to the State of Indian trading jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.846" offset="2402722">Now, I would ask the Court to examine the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.941" offset="2415156">Putting in context, in 1953, Congress was considering a number of major cases of Indian legislation following four or five separate categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.852" offset="2454758">Public Law 83-280 was merely one piece.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.793" offset="2466565">It had a narrow legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.379" offset="2476910">It was a law and order statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.210" offset="2488195">It was specifically for the purpose fulfilling the hiatus in law-enforcement on the reservation from the criminal standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.205" offset="2524244">It was for the purpose of providing a state form for the determination of civil litigation from the civil standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.225" offset="2560293">And if you examine the Act, the language of the Act from page A-10 of brief, you’ll notice that it says that the jurisdiction given to the State is jurisdiction over civil causes of action and it provides that civil laws of the State that are of general applicability to private persons or private property shall have the same effect on Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.975" offset="2659244">Now, the Court has to ask itself, is that language of plenary grant a jurisdiction?</text>
            <text syncTime="645.122" offset="2683904">Consider it was respect to taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.374" offset="2700831">It says nothing about taxation but when Congress wants state taxes to apply on an Indian reservation, it says so in no uncertain terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.085" offset="2739702">Look at the Claim of Termination Act on page 27 of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.227" offset="2756315">It provides that after termination, the property shall be subject to the same taxes, state and federal, as in the case of non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.914" offset="2791006">Look at Menominee Termination Bill on page 30, provides that all statutes of the United States which affect Indians because of their status as Indians shall no longer be applicable and it provides that the laws of the State shall apply to the tribe and its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.871" offset="2854849">That is plenary jurisdiction grant language.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.064" offset="2875643">Now, Congress has made one general act with respect to state taxes on Indian reservations, that’s Buck Act which you’ve heard referred to in the other cases today.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.142" offset="2911901">Congress said, “States, you may apply your taxes in federal reservations both income, use, sales but you may not apply them to Indian reservations.”</text>

            <text syncTime="789.016" offset="3259434">Congress did not say, “We’re going to repeal the Buck Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="792.547" offset="3273540">Congress knew what it was repealing and what it was not repealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.129" offset="3291930">If you look at the legislative history and especially the hearing which the Federal Government just find on archives, the hearing of the subcommittee of June 29, 1953, you’ll find the tax discussion concerning this Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.592" offset="3345742">The first one and I’m delighted to have found it because in that, Mr. Soloway who was chief counsel for the BIA discusses the question of subsidy to the States assuming jurisdiction under this Act and the Congressmen involved are Congressmen from all of the States with large Indian populations and they repeatedly say, “but what about the federal subsidy?</text>
            <text syncTime="831.019" offset="3427453">Who will pay for the burden on the Court system?</text>
            <text syncTime="833.433" offset="3437066">What about this jurisdiction, this additional law and order, cost to the States?”</text>
            <text syncTime="837.484" offset="3453262">And Mr. Soloway says, “The Government feels that this is just a burden the States have got to assume if they wanted.”</text>
            <text syncTime="843.806" offset="3478549">And you all know the history of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.954" offset="3487222">Some States refused to assume that burden because they would not have any tax money to pay for it with.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.547" offset="3513553">This is the point in the dialogue at which Congress if it had ever intended it would have said, “Congressmen, you may now have your States tax the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.390" offset="3552946">Arizona, you can tax those 100,000 Navajos and pay for this jurisdiction if you assume it.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.669" offset="3578023">Washington, you may tax those 26,000 Indians and you may pay for this jurisdiction if you assume it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="874.592" offset="3601742">Congress didn’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.193" offset="3608116">Congress left the Buck Act intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.489" offset="3617311">It left the Trader Statute intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.898" offset="3626924">It made no reference to the Taxation and Public Law 83-280 in terms of the specific grant that Congress’ Policy dictates.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.057" offset="3663600">Now, if the Court were to uphold the State Supreme Court in this case, the consequences would be disastrous.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.518" offset="3689409">It would mean an impel of all of the tax immunities of Indian tribes which this Court has said is not likely to be attributed to Congress than the Lone Wolf and Hitchcock case.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.425" offset="3733086">It would be the rejection of the expressed language requirement which this Court required in the Squire versus Capoeman case.</text>

            <text syncTime="971.854" offset="3990758">And that discussion made it clear that Congress never even considered in committee for a minute imposing any tax liability on the Indian people themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.428" offset="4025135">Now, congressional policy in 1953 said, “We want to fulfill this hiatus in law enforcement.</text>

            <text syncTime="988.593" offset="4057736">In 1968, that policy is still intact except with consent of the Indian people.</text>

            <text syncTime="1053.487" offset="4317288">If you’re going give jurisdiction to the States, these Indian people are not taxed, are they?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.298" offset="4332544">And he said, “Well, they pay certain taxes as off the reservation they pay taxes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.558" offset="4345605">But he said, “But their land is not taxed, and they don’t pay income tax, and their corporations on the reservation don’t pay tax, do they?</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.877" offset="4370892">So, who’s going to pay for this?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.833" offset="4378728">That was the general tenor of the conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.788" offset="4386565">All of the Congressmen recognized there was no tax to be forthcoming from the Indian people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.413" offset="4405060">And they demanded that Congress subsidized it in some way and Congress decided not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.715" offset="4422196">In North Dakota, in fact passed a statute saying, we take jurisdiction as soon as the BIA makes provision for a reimbursing this for the cost and it was held that that could not be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.573" offset="4465664">I think I better save my last few minutes for rebuttal, Your Honor.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alvin J. Ziontz</label>
            <text syncTime="1102.974" offset="4515297">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.460" offset="4529194">This is a tax case but we see it in a larger context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.398" offset="4548942">We see the case and I say, we are speaking as counsel for the Colville Confederated Tribes and amicus tribes as a case involving essential aspects of Indian tribal sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.501" offset="4601396">A concept which we think is long overdue for revitalization by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.515" offset="4625429">And I would point out certain basic principles that I think in here, in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.376" offset="4644864">First, I think it’s necessary to start with the principle that Indian tribes are sui generis because of the special aspects of their position and I would point out five special aspects that apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.358" offset="4692825">We deal with a group of people, first of all, of specific ancestry with a special historic relationship to the United States and a relationship which involves a national honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.196" offset="4740159">Secondly, the people occupy their own land area, an area with established boundaries reserved from non-Indian encroachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.625" offset="4773909">This was the basic purpose of the United States in establishing that reservation and guaranteed to the Indians by the United States, a guarantee given before creation of State Government and looking towards the future encirclement of the reservation by State Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.552" offset="4845589">Thirdly, the lands and the income from the lands are held in trust by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.067" offset="4871607">A very significant legal factor because it is the foundation for the fiduciary relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.013" offset="4899401">That is to say the United States is trustee of lands for its Indian beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.561" offset="4925628">This does not necessarily depend on any guardian ward principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.303" offset="4944541">Fourth, a tribal government functioning over that territory according to a tribal constitution which was submitted to the United States and given approval by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.004" offset="4991352">And finally, the land, the people and their Government are all subject to the plenary power of Congress and all under the tutelage of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.798" offset="5030536">Now, given these factors which are present here and I think distinguished away the Oklahoma cases and (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.469" offset="5069197">We have clearly in tribal sovereignty aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.966" offset="5083199">Tribal sovereignty does not derive from Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.660" offset="5093961">Congress did not grant the tribes their inherent power of self-government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.373" offset="5112874">Congress may restrict it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.880" offset="5118934">Congress may destroy it but unless Congress has done so, that sovereignty prevails.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.841" offset="5142758">An essential element of that sovereignty is taxing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.717" offset="5158222">The federal policy towards these tribal governments is undeniable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.570" offset="5173687">It is the strength of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.768" offset="5178493">It is to preserve them, its institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.435" offset="5189151">Congress has reached the decision that this is a way for progress to be achieved for the Indian people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.544" offset="5213497">The Indian people have accepted that in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.950" offset="5227186">They responded to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.091" offset="5231783">They were vitally involved in the affairs of their tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.679" offset="5246098">Educated Indians are participating in their tribal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.291" offset="5260518">Indians who have served in the military, come back to the reservations and have run for office and are participating in tribal affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.814" offset="5286640">This is a viable, important concept which should not be glossed over in the concern between Congress and the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.016" offset="5319450">Now, State of Washington here, although it argues that Public Law 280 give jurisdiction of taxes tribe, insists that even without 280, it has some kind of residual jurisdiction that it could’ve imposed this tax and in fact does impose the cigarette tax over all tribes in the State of Washington, quite apart from 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.667" offset="5406072">Now, there are identified at least six basic principles in the cases that bar the State, bar any state from imposing any State taxes on a tribe which meets all these qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.387" offset="5456959">There is, I say first of all, the concept of tribal sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.396" offset="5472946">Secondly, in the case of the Colville tribes, tribal preemption, the tribe has, subsequent to the arrest of Mr. Tonasket, passed its own statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.913" offset="5515055">That statute is entitled to recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.213" offset="5524250">In State ex rel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.099" offset="5527803">Turtle versus Merrill, the Ninth Circuit recognized that a tribe which validly legislates, preempts the field and a state may not impair that legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.858" offset="5570853">And it should be noted that Washington law provides and the Attorney General has interpreted the law to mean that wherever the State has jurisdiction, it is exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.304" offset="5604603">There is no concurrent tribal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.393" offset="5612962">It ousts the tribal jurisdiction entirely and particularly in the field of excise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.205" offset="5632188">If Washington state law applies in toto, then there is not an integrum left for tribal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.898" offset="5663013">A third bar to the extension of the state taxes is the so-called infringement test and I suggest that one deserves careful attention because surely there should be some guidelines about what as to what kind of factual showing needs to be made at the trial level before the Court can conclude that there is or is not infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.794" offset="5742529">This should not be a judicial obstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.672" offset="5758098">Fourth is the Doctrine of Federal Instrumentality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.922" offset="5767084">I wouldn’t elaborate on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.547" offset="5773563">That’s a familiar doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.747" offset="5778369">Fifth is the Doctrine of Federal Preemption and the trader statute has been held to be a federal preemption of Indian commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.117" offset="5803865">And finally is the Doctrine of Federal Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.805" offset="5814627">State laws cannot invade an area which is contrary to or impedes a congressional policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.883" offset="5842944">280 has been urged by the State as giving it cart blanche to assert this tax liability on the Indians of the Colville reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.914" offset="5883068">I submit that 280 does not assist the State in its position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.237" offset="5900309">280 clearly reserves out from state jurisdiction, the traditional tax immunity of Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.629" offset="5933850">I submit the exclusion statute, exclusion section, must be read as preserving all prior law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.726" offset="5962271">See Kirkwood versus Arenas which held to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.450" offset="5981184">In summary, I would say that the Court in 1953, Congress was attempting to achieve several inconsistent goals and the lack of hearings perhaps attest to the fact that a statute was not drawn with the care that it should’ve been drawn with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.172" offset="6044087">On the one hand, it wanted to replace the jurisdictional tangle with the uniform system of state law and on the other hand, it also wanted to preserve Indian tribes on their territorial base.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.265" offset="6088391">A careful examination of the statute shows an unmistakable congressional attempt to keep the State out of areas involving the use of trust property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.831" offset="6126738">There’s clearly no more direct example of use of trust property than an Indian conducting a grocery store on his allotment on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.330" offset="6172714">The federal policy looks towards Indians developing their lands in non-agricultural, non-natural resource ways, in getting into business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.329" offset="6208658">I believe that on behalf of the tribes, this Court deserves to -- the doctrine of tribal sovereignty deserves careful examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.589" offset="6245752">It is a third factor in this three-way fight between the tribes, the Federal Government and the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.140" offset="6267904">Thank you.</text>
