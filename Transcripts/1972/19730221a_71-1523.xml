            <label>Mr. Robert McCormick Figg, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="28.135" offset="215960">This is an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of South Carolina which upheld against the challenge under the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.559" offset="281579">A transaction between the State of South Carolina and the Baptist College of Charleston wherein made under a 1969 statute entitled the Educational Facilities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.696" offset="362141">The transaction on behalf of the State was to be conducted by its Educational Facilities Authority which this Act provided should be State’s Budget and Control Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.931" offset="431104">That Board is composed of the Governor, the State Treasurer, the Comptroller General, the legislative and two legislative chairmen ex-official, it’s the core of the State Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.918" offset="475094">It’s the governing board of the State’s Departments of Finance, Property and Personnel and the Act gives it these duties which I shall refer to “as an incident of its functions in connection with the public finances of the State.”</text>
            <text syncTime="110.823" offset="546670">The Baptist College of Charleston is an activity of the South Carolina Baptist Convention and it’s chartered to “operate a Baptist Liberal Arts College for educational purposes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="125.026" offset="603512">It manages the affairs of the college and trust for the South Carolina Baptist Convention and the courts below have found that it is a religious activity and that the question is properly raised in its case under the First Amendment even though they didn’t agree with that view of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.006" offset="683447">Under this transaction, the -- what is happening here is that the State under its own Constitution cannot give a grant to a religious institution to construct a building or a facility even though it’s of a neutral purpose because its own Constitution prohibits direct or indirect aide to a sectarian institution and our code has said that that means that no state funds can be given to a religious institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.839" offset="830777">It undertakes therefore to authorize the Budget and Control Board which as I say is the core of the State Government to issue South Carolina State Revenue Bonds which would give the purchases immunity from federal income taxation on the interest and thereby benefit the institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.422" offset="917086">To that extent, it enables, in other words the borrowing on behalf of the college to be at a lower rate of interest and would otherwise supply and it uses in order to accomplish this, the format of legislation under which was commonly known as self-liquidating project will authorize back in 1933 and 1934 and by other Act under which electrical systems and water works and what not were financed by out of the earnings of an operation and out of the profits, the fees that were derived from the consumers.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert McCormick Figg, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="267.435" offset="1173086">On the contrary, our Supreme Court has made a statement in one case that in this enlightened age the State will not allow one of its revenue bond issues to go into default even though it’s not technically liable on them and we’ve never had a default on our revenue bond issue of the electric or the water works or the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.217" offset="1252289">Now, the State did have one revenue bond issued and what they call the South Carolina Public Service Authority, the Santee-Cooper Hydroelectric Project but those bonds have been paid over the operation of an electrical system and the charges to consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.216" offset="1320208">Now, this is a little different though from the usual self-liquidating projects because here, they do not let the project issued the bonds and then pay off out of its operations because the project is the college and the college issuing revenue bonds would not be able to give the purchases of the tax immunity which the State can give.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.707" offset="1414248">So, what the State does is to take a conveyance from the Baptist College of a part of its campus, then it leases its back at an agreed rent, leases that campus back at an agreed rental and that rental is of course calculated to pay off the principal and interest of the bonds which the State has issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.731" offset="1502333">Now, the Act provides that this Authority, the Budget and Control Board, that is the State Government’s core, issue and sell to the public State of South Carolina general revenue bonds, payable principal and interest only from the rent to be received by the Board under the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.700" offset="1574222">And those proceeds, as I said, are to be spent in a general program because it’s not just for religious colleges, it’s for all non-public colleges in the State and for religiously neutral facilities, these building and facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.647" offset="1646007">But in order to make the bond saleable, the State Board as empowered by this Act to fix and revise from time to time and charge and collect fees and charges for the use of and for the services furnished by the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.523" offset="1717478">So that, while the bonds are issued, pledged against the rents, the rents will never change because you don’t need to raise or lower the rents.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.365" offset="1752795">The rent is calculated to be the amount required to pay off the bond issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.905" offset="1770977">What the Board have to do with and in seeing that the rent is paid, is to have to do with the adequacy of the fees and charges for the use of the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.598" offset="1829804">Just as in an electrical project, the project itself would raise or lower the rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.817" offset="1850598">Here, the State assumes by legislation a responsibility in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.384" offset="1872959">In fact, the Act says that a bondholder can compel the Authority to exert that power to re-fix and revise from time to time and charge and collect fees and charges for the use of the project.</text>

            <text syncTime="458.205" offset="1936175">How about the cost, Mr. Figg, may they also cut the expenses in order to be shared in net rentals?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert McCormick Figg, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="465.250" offset="1964387">Yes, I wouldn’t -- I don’t know that they are specifically authorized to do that but they are commanded to see that enough fees and charges are charged by the college to pay the maintenance, the repair and the operation of the college as the first group that to be taken into account in fixing and revising the fees and then next, pay the principal -- they’re sufficient to pay the principal and interest on the bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.554" offset="2089566">Now, I would just ordinarily, of course should think that rent came in operating that shows you the language here is more referable in its wording to an ordinary self-liquidating project but it does point out the fact that the income, the funds that are pledged for these bonds are the student fees and charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.907" offset="2175039">Not just the rent because there would be no rent if the fees and charges are not adequate, the rent wouldn’t be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.647" offset="2209938">If the fees and charges are too high and the student body is cut down, perhaps the rent wouldn’t be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.817" offset="2234598">If the college got discouraged, perhaps the project would seize.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.524" offset="2249435">What would happen then?</text>
            <text syncTime="537.539" offset="2253511">We think the State under power given to operate these projects would have to step in for the bondholders and see that the religious activity is operated.</text>

            <text syncTime="572.531" offset="2393527">It’s been an annual performance that student fees at virtually all institutions are not only fixed every year but affixed higher every year.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.325" offset="2428635">The requirements have been going up and of course, to some extent, that affects the patronage.</text>

            <text syncTime="600.946" offset="2507107">The reason was that the colleges, I suspect, were having trouble from the fact that not being public.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.623" offset="2541902">Their tuition fees have been larger and therefore their student patronage has been smaller.</text>

            <text syncTime="621.882" offset="2590908">It has been recognized by this Court to be a public purpose to stimulate education and the State is undertaking to, I suppose to protect itself against having to take over.</text>

            <text syncTime="1439.930" offset="5863111">He challenged both that this Court could very well consider that it’s the standing between the citizen and his Government rather than a monetary standing under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.344" offset="5940746">I’m not sure that the First Amendment is necessarily a monetary question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.334" offset="5960704">I think that question goes beyond perhaps the amount of taxes he might have to pay or any other question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.257" offset="5996440">And to conclude, if Your Honors please, the entanglement of fixing fees, we think which involves the previous year of surplus or deficit, the amount of maintenance expected, the repairs, insurance, the depreciations, salaries or wages, supplies, rents and so forth that all of that has got to be taken into account by the State in advance of the fixing of fees, default us to be guarded against and not awaited before the State would take action in discharge of the statutory duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.112" offset="6151816">And in the event that the college proved unable or unwilling to continue, then we think that in the end, the fact that the State would have to see to the operation of this religious activity to pay off the bond in itself will produce objection of an entanglement between Government and the church activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1719.183" offset="6980106">Now, to get to the merits, I’d like to go back a bit and explain the nature of this transaction because it is not the ordinary self-liquidating type of revenue bond that really gained this (Inaudible) in the 30’s at the time when my friend and I served in the South Carolina together and had a lot of those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.680" offset="7070072">This is comparable to the normal industrial development revenue bond which have been going on and I think gained their sentences in the 60’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.367" offset="7124825">What happens here is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.452" offset="7137155">The Authority takes title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.591" offset="7145723">It makes this lease with the college.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.885" offset="7158888">In this lease, it sets up the covenants which the colleges got to perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.362" offset="7180831">It then mortgages the project to a trustee bank and at the same time, assigns to that trustee bank its rights under the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.798" offset="7230568">So that actually, the State is nothing more or less than conduit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1840.730" offset="7466297">Because the trustee bank receives the money, pays it out and under the indenture enforces the rights and remedies of the bondholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.367" offset="7508825">And that’s the way that’s frankly, a routine type of financing in the industrial revenue bond field and in this college type of field.</text>

            <text syncTime="1868.776" offset="7578520">It does not contain the trust instrument but what it does contain are rules and regulations that the State Board adopted following Tilton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.708" offset="7614255">And in those regulations, it prescribes that there shall be a lease and it prescribes that there shall be an indenture, a trust indenture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.135" offset="7655946">I think you’ll find those on -- beginning on page 47 in the jurisdictional statement are the regulations relating to the functioning of the Authority which spell out just exactly what takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.093" offset="7823757">So that, as I see it in the, in Tilton, there was an outright grant of money but there was also the covenant not to violate the religious that make use of the property for religious purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.657" offset="7886033">We have to do that in a slightly different way because we’re not granting money and we can’t make the institution pay us back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.493" offset="7917380">We’ve given them nothing, there’s nothing to take back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.930" offset="7931068">So, what we do is to subject that property to our covenant that will not be use and so long as the institutional, any voluntary grantee of that institution on this property it can’t use it for religious purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.139" offset="7987911">Now, that part of the, our regulations and the holding of grant holding in Tilton seem to me to be identical.</text>

            <text syncTime="1984.590" offset="8041723">We are really taking an advantage of a provision in the internal revenue code to give these people tax exempt but that’s actually rather significant.</text>
