            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We will hear first this morning in number 71-829, Mourning against Family Publications.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.341" offset="144697">Mr. Schnapper, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric Schnapper</label>
            <text syncTime="16.729" offset="170297">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.038" offset="183568">This is the first case to reach this court arising out of one of the most important federal statute for the protection of the consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.666" offset="210004">The Truth in Lending Act of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.508" offset="221393">That statute was enacted to inform consumers about the cost of credit and about the other terms of credit transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.799" offset="254516">Congress was particularly concerned, to aid consumers like the plaintiff in this case, a 75 year old widow living on a government pension of $82.50 a month, who can ill afford high finance charges or excessive financial commitments.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.747" offset="318360">Defendant admits that it failed to make several disclosures applied by the regulations of Federal Reserve Board but claims that those regulations are invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.153" offset="355976">The facts of the case are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.727" offset="366320">On August 19th, 1969 following a telephone solicitation, Mrs. Mourning entered into a contract with the defendant Family Publications Service for the purchase of four magazines.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.943" offset="411146">The contract is set out on pages 6 and 7 of the printed appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.427" offset="429119">Under the terms of the contract, Mrs. Mourning was to receive Life, Holiday, Ladies Home Journal and Travel and Camera for period of five years.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="90.771" offset="466422">You would help me counsel, because I wonder if -- I am not sure I have spelled it out accurately.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.732" offset="490350">What would be the price of each of these if you just subscribe by mail in the ordinary course?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eric_schnapper" startTime="106.805" stopTime="110.650">
            <label>Mr. Eric Schnapper</label>
            <text syncTime="106.805" offset="530578">There is nothing in the record to indicate what the price would have been.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="110.650" stopTime="116.425">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="110.650" offset="545938">Do you think that's not important to the case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eric_schnapper" startTime="116.425" stopTime="141.414">
            <label>Mr. Eric Schnapper</label>
            <text syncTime="116.425" offset="569031">Under the terms of the regulation and the statute, it's not.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.693" offset="586167">Whether or not, she was given a good price is ultimately something that she under our economic system ought to been able to determine for self.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.990" offset="619290">One of the problems that arises out of the failure of the defendant to disclose the total price of the goods was that even she had been aware, the terms offered by the publisher directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.578" offset="661713">She had no way of making that comparison.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="141.414" stopTime="154.048">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="141.414" offset="669027">Well if it's an inflated price on a package deal in order to conceal carrying charges, isn't that pretty important?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eric_schnapper" startTime="154.048" stopTime="193.381">
            <label>Mr. Eric Schnapper</label>
            <text syncTime="154.048" offset="719600">Well, absent the regulation it would be necessary to inquire about the general practices of the defendant as to whether or not, it was inflating as prices --the whole purpose of the regulation was to make that very detailed and complicated factual inquiry unnecessary, both to avoid deterring private actions such as this one and to make sure that the statute itself was administrative, otherwise the Federal Reserve Board and other enforcement agencies would be in the business of trying to compare the prices for other magazines or bicycles or television sets with the prices charged in contracts like this for all the consumer contracts that are signed every day in country.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="193.381" stopTime="214.055">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="193.381" offset="876857">But in the classical usury cases, isn't it ordinarily an important factor of evidence to show that the automobile, particular automobile had listed price, a cash price and a time price.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.150" offset="939969">That's the way you improve your concealed usury.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eric_schnapper" startTime="214.055" stopTime="214.615">
            <label>Mr. Eric Schnapper</label>
            <text syncTime="214.055" offset="959613">Well, that that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="214.615" stopTime="218.591">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="214.615" offset="961808">Do you say that under these regulations that becomes irrelevant now?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eric_schnapper" startTime="218.591" stopTime="650.104">
            <label>Mr. Eric Schnapper</label>
            <text syncTime="218.591" offset="977690">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.194" offset="980198">Under the regulations that problem is not the one that has to be dealt with by the board or by plaintiffs seeking to prove that the information should have been disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.057" offset="1023561">Mrs. Mourning paid $3.95 down and agreed to pay $3.95 a year for two-and-a-half years.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.278" offset="1052505">The contract did not disclose that the cost of magazines was $122.45 in order to disclose the amount due after the down payment was $118.50.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.265" offset="1100466">In addition, the contract did not disclose, would have been revealed first time, the first time in this court by the defendant that if Mrs. Mourning had paid cash for the magazines, she might well have paid less to the defendant itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.988" offset="1155323">All of this information withheld from Mrs. Mourning by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.846" offset="1170787">It was required to be disclosed two consumers in credit transactions covered by the Truth in Lending Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.577" offset="1197641">Mrs. Mourning refused to make any payments under the contract after the initial down payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.641" offset="1217912">On December of 16th, 1969 defendant sent Mrs. Mourning at first of at least 8 dunning letters, all of which are set out on pages 14-21 of the printed appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.982" offset="1259290">The first letter stated that FPS had had Mrs. Mourning's subscriptions entered for the entire five year period and her contract could not be canceled.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.418" offset="1301086">On December 28th of that year FPS sent Mrs. Mourning a second letter stating that FPS had paid for the magazines in advance and that Mrs. Mourning had incurred an obligation to repay FPS.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.066" offset="1347688">The letter also stated, this is a credit account and as such must be repaid by you on a monthly basis much the same as if you had purchased any other type of monthly, any other type of merchandise on a monthly budget plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.963" offset="1407248">On April 23rd, 1970 Mrs. Mourning brought this action in the District Court for the Southern District of Florida suing to enforce the Truth in Lending Act, federal jurisdiction to enforce the statute expressly conferred upon District Courts by section 1640 of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.090" offset="1471718">Mrs. Mourning in her amended complaint alleged that the contract with FPS was a credit transaction covered by the Truth in Lending Act and that the disclosures required by the Act had not been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.958" offset="1515186">Plaintiffs sought statutory damage of $100 plus legal fees and cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.321" offset="1532635">FPS in its answer asserted three defenses relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.703" offset="1550190">FPS urged first that none of the disclosure provision of the act applied to this transaction because the contract did not involve the finance charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.022" offset="1587493">As a second defense FPS asserted that the Act did not apply to the contract because FPS had not extended credit to Mrs. Mourning.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.862" offset="1618840">Finally, FPS maintained that even if the contract were covered by the Act, neither Mrs. Mourning or any other consumer could enforce the statute because FPS had not imposed to finance charge under this type of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.768" offset="1678399">FPS concedes however that it did not make the disclosures which plaintiff claims are legally required.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.061" offset="1707656">On October 30th, 1970 the District Court granted Mrs. Mourning's motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.792" offset="1730539">That court ruled that the transaction was subject to the Truth in Lending disclosure requirements because the purchase price was payable in more than four installments.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.435" offset="1765125">The District Court upheld and applied the four installments promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board which requires that disclosures be made to consumers in any transaction involving more than four installments without regard to whether or not finance charge is proved and would have been imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.666" offset="1834088">The District Court also held that the instant contract involved the extension of credit by FPS to Mrs. Mourning.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.926" offset="1859062">Judgment was entered on behalf of the plaintiff the amount of $100 plus cost and Attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.024" offset="1879437">The Court of Appeals reversed on appeal and order the complaint dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.125" offset="1899917">In an opinion by Judge Coleman, Court of Appeals agreed that the Four Installment Rule required FPS to make the disclosures withheld in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.290" offset="1932518">But the Court of Appeals held that that rule was invalid because it was not within the Federal Reserve Board's power to promulgate regulations under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.858" offset="1966791">The Court of Appeals also held that the Four Installment Rule was unconstitutional because it constituted conclusive presumptions that all transactions with more than four installments involved a hidden finance charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.825" offset="2014647">The Court of Appeals did not rule under two additional defenses raised by FPS and the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.522" offset="2037426">The writ of certiorari was sought in this court to review the decision of the Fifth Circuit in validating the Four Installment Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.522" offset="2061458">FPS did not urged in the proceedings below that the Four Installment Rule was unconstitutional and expressly does not rely on that ground before this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.198" offset="2096149">FPS does argue however, that Four Installment regulation exceeded the board's rule making authority under the Truth in Lending Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.391" offset="2128959">Statute involved was enacted in 1968 with the expressed purpose of giving to consumers a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer would be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and to avoid the uninformed use of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.788" offset="2190503">The statute arose out of seven years of hearings and committee findings that consumers were generally, unaware of the terms of their loans, contracts and other credit transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.358" offset="2224776">The legislative history revealed that creditors generally withheld vital information and that the value of what was disclosed, was often impaired by widely disparate terminology and accounting methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.301" offset="2272528">In addition to express the stated purpose quoted contained in section 1601 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.229" offset="2296247">Section 1604 of the statute specifically authorized that Federal Reserve Board to promulgate whatever regulations it might deem necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.036" offset="2343476">In addition to delegating this general regulatory responsibility to the board, Congress also enacted a number of specific provisions requiring several disclosures under various circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.467" offset="2385272">These disclosures include price of the goods, the amount to be paid after the down payment, the finance charge involve and your annual interest rate of finance charge expressed as a percentage.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.529" offset="2429471">The statute and regulations also require the standardized terminology be used to facilitate comparison of various contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.397" offset="2456952">Some of the problems as to how the purpose of meaningful disclosure would be achieved and dealt with detail by congress in these substantive provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.230" offset="2484328">Other problems were left untreated for resolution by the board itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.520" offset="2501465">Congress provided the enforcement of the statute and regulations will be left primarily to private parties suing such as Mrs. Mourning and also mandated enforcement of the statute and regulations by various federal agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.971" offset="2559248">The Four Installment Rule whose validity is at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.845" offset="2570742">It's contained in 12 CFR section 226.2(k) and it's set on page 4 on petitioners brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.256" offset="2600417">The effect of the rule is to require disclosures be made two consumers, in any credit transactions payable on more than for installments, regardless of whether the creditor admits to imposing a finance charge in that transactions or others.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.118" offset="2651826">In the instant case, the Four Installment Rule would have required in a minimum that FPS disclosed to Mrs. Mourning that total price of the magazines and the amount which she still owed FPS after her initial down payment.</text>

            <text syncTime="652.074" offset="2711698">$20.45.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.916" offset="2723088">Whether the Federal Reserve Board's Four Installment Rule is a valid, it turns upon whether it was within the Board's expressed authority to promulgate regulations as set out in the Truth in Lending Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.195" offset="2764152">The Authority of the Board is defined in Section 1604 of the statute reproduced on pages 3 and 4 of petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.038" offset="2807515">That Section provides, the Board shall prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this Sub Chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.154" offset="2835937">These regulations may contain such classifications, differentiations or other provisions and may provide for such adjustments or exceptions for any class of transactions as in a judgment of the Board are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of this sub-chapter to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof or to facilitate compliance there with.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.503" offset="2929351">The Four Installment Rule is necessary first to prevent evasion of the substantive requirement contained in Section 1638 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.379" offset="2960906">The creditors disclosed to consumers, the finance charge in annual interest rate imposed in any credit transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.803" offset="2990582">In the normal credit sale with which we are familiar, the merchant imposes one charge for the purchase of goods for cash and imposes an additional separate charge for the privilege of paying for the goods over an extended period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.116" offset="3047842">Congress was particularly concerned however, that the amount of this finance charge might be hidden in the price of the goods themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.051" offset="3079607">The Board included that such a danger was very real.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.169" offset="3096012">Their concern was for example, that instead of charging a $100 for television set and $20 for privilege paying for over two years, the merchant will charge $120 for the television set and inform the consumer that the credit was free.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.850" offset="3150764">Such a merchant would naturally assert that the annual interest rate involved was zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.754" offset="3170408">This would not merely leave consumers uninformed, but would create a false illusion at the merchant's credit with significantly less expensive than the credit of lenders such as banks which had no prices in which they could vary their finance charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.381" offset="3220877">The congressional hearings indicated that varying finance charges and prices was a problem even before the statute was enacted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1269.934" offset="5183091">Well, we say it doesn't make any difference under the regulation, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.459" offset="5229171">The Four Installment Rule is also necessary to prevent evasion of the other disclosure requirements of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.805" offset="5250591">In addition to requiring disclosure of finance charges, the statute requires the disclosure of a host of other credit terms, the amount financed and the price of the goods, time and number of payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.734" offset="5294268">If however, a creditor asserts in his contract that he does not impose the finance charge, a serious question arises under the face of the statute as to whether or not the creditor need to disclose anything to consumer whether by having first hidden his finance charge, and evaded the requirement that that to be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.140" offset="5359888">He can then turn around and evade all the other requirements of the statute and claim a complete exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.299" offset="5380577">The Four Installment Rule precludes this type of circumvention as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.107" offset="5395832">The regulation provides that the usual disclosures must be made in any transaction involving finance charges but also in any transaction in which more than four installments are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.817" offset="5442644">The rule does not only prevent circumvention of the Act in this way, but effectuates the expressly stated purpose of the act to provide consumers with credit terms of their transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.085" offset="5495724">Congress expressly delegated to the Federal Reserve Board responsibility for deciding when it was a danger evasion and profession and remedies to be involved to deal with that danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.927" offset="5535117">The board's expertise in understanding the statute goes back to many years before its actual enactment because the board was intimately involved in the process of drafting the statute through the congressional hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.120" offset="5579839">After the statute put draft regulations for proposing more than 1,200 comments considered and subsequent to consideration of them, the Federal Reserve Board promulgated the Four Installment rule in its present form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.225" offset="5624247">That rule has remained in effect by three years of experience, reflecting the board's judgment that it is operative and effectuates the purposes for which it was designed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.400" offset="5664998">The judgment and expertise of a board, of an agency such as the federal reserve board intimately involved with the framing of the statute and charged with responsibility of setting its machinery in motion and of making the parts work efficiently and smoothly while they are yet new and untried, that was entirely great difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.615" offset="5753814">A issue in this case is not an ancillary regulation of minor significance but a rule which the Federal Reserve Board has found vital to preventing wholesale evasion of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.931" offset="5795088">If the Federal Reserve Board's, Four Installment Rule is invalidated, large numbers of creditors currently bearing their finance charges will be able to refuse, disclose, both their prices and all the other credit terms of their transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.279" offset="5844511">The board has further projected that the number of creditors thus hiding their finance charges will increase as a result of the promulgation of the statute and that the effect of the statute will thus be to decrease, rather than increase, the amount of information which consumers get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.357" offset="5908773">The legislative history of the statute in the case of the burden of this, decrease in disclosure will fall particularly, heavily upon the poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.568" offset="5937612">In sharp contrast to these consequence, creditors such as Family Publication Service will suffer no serious inconvenience if they are required to make disclosures and comply with the Four Installment Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.987" offset="5979303">FPS's most retailers uses a printed form contract and standardized terms there in and virtually all of the missing information and all of the missing standardized terminology in this case, could have been included on that form when it was printed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.204" offset="6040221">The only interest which FPS could have had in withholding the absent information from Mrs. Mourning was to lure her into making an uninformed decision, to sign a contracts at issue and it was precisely to prevent this kind of uninformed purchases that the Truth in Lending Act was enacted by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="1551.349" offset="6308760">Apparently not, the letters sent to Mrs. Mourning indicated that FPS had in fact taped with the magazines to some extent in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.180" offset="6340106">So one letter suggested they had fully invested her contract, which suggested that they had paid for the things completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.878" offset="6366856">The letters indicated the very least that they had prepaid publishers to some extent from their own funds and that she owed them money to repay them and the word 'repay' is used in the letters for what expenditures they already made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.539" offset="6421504">Now, if for example she had doubled the bank, borrowed $122 and paid it to the magazine companies, it would still be the case that she was receiving magazines only after she had put out money to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.366" offset="6472808">But the fact that matters that would clearly be a credit transaction because the lender involved would have parted with value not to her but to the magazine company prior to receive any --</text>

            <text syncTime="1917.276" offset="7772453">That is pointed out on the page 6 of the Government's brief in Footnote 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.796" offset="7790529">What happened to the legislation was that it passed Senate, the legislation essentially enacted into the -- as an amendment to the act of Four Installment Rule, that's an issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.927" offset="7835042">The legislation did pass the Senate, but it was not reported out of the house banking and currency committee in time before Congress adjourned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.421" offset="7873076">This legislation has essentially died for this term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.751" offset="7890422">The other question, I would like to address myself at the beginning, Mr. Chief Justice Burger's question with regard to evidence in the case as to what publisher's charge for these magazines subscription would have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.449" offset="7941204">I take it that question is directed to determining whether in fact there is varied finance charged in this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.782" offset="7966490">The proper comparison Mr. Chief Justice, I would submit, would be not what the publishers charge, but what Family Publications would have charged a cash customer, a person that was willing to pay the entire amount online when they contracted for the magazines as opposed to what they charged someone who would defer the payment over a longer period of time such as Mrs. Mourning.</text>

            <text syncTime="2010.755" offset="8146422">In the District Court, an affidavit was submitted by the Vice President of Family Publications Services.</text>

            <text syncTime="2156.612" offset="8729788">That's right, because we first of all say that the provisions of the act define creditors, those who regularly extend finance charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.275" offset="8768449">Now they are people that have to disclose under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.496" offset="8781406">There will be no problem at all in applying this provision if every creditor simply said, my finance charge is this, my selling price is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.748" offset="8810350">No difficultly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.883" offset="8814947">But there are some creditors that have never, perhaps never differentiated the cost of credit from the selling price of the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.995" offset="8851310">Apparent reason being that they sold primarily all their goods on credit and there would be no reason for them without a disclosure requirement for it to differentiate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.409" offset="8885060">They would say my price is $120 payable in 10 monthly installments for one year or 10 monthly installments over a period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.357" offset="8920795">That will be all they tell the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.429" offset="8929050">The question is what is going to be done about those transactions?</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.433" offset="8941066">Well, the assumption throughout the congressional hearings, and seven years of congressional hearings is that whenever a creditor said or a retailer said there is no charge for credit, that simply meant that somewhere in that selling price, a component of that selling price was the cost of credit to the retailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.982" offset="9023300">Now this assumption is based on a very simple economic fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.415" offset="9036988">Whenever the seller extends credit for any appreciable length of time incurs cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.413" offset="9057050">Now we maintain that this case is no exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.317" offset="9068648">FPS sent letters to Mrs. Mourning and that cost the money that they would not have had to incur if they operated on a cash business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.431" offset="9097070">They took legal action against those who defaulted as a matter of fact on page 19 of the appendix, FPS tells Mrs. Mourning, they don't want to do that to her because it's very expensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.352" offset="9140746">That's another cost that they would not have incurred if they operated on a cash basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.637" offset="9157883">They ran collection offices in Florida for people who were late in their payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.014" offset="9175437">This is revealed on page 25 and 27 of the appendix, and FPS itself told Mrs. Mourning that had paid for this merchandise before it received payment for Mrs. Mourning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.269" offset="9228413">We don't know whether FPS ran credit checks or had a bad debt reserve or anything of that sort, whether it had to borrow money to pay for these magazine subscriptions, but we do know that every transaction for any appreciable length of time, the cost of creditor is going to be incurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.706" offset="9298213">That would not be incurred if they ran a cash business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.326" offset="9308662">The problem that faced the Federal Reserve Board is what they do about this, because their solution is the Four Installment Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.212" offset="9340217">Now before the ink was even dry on this bill, the Federal Reserve Board began the task of setting the Act in motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.669" offset="9366026">As my co-counsel has explained, the Federal Reserve Board was involved in this legislation from the very beginning, it testified many times before Congress and took an active part in consideration of the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.586" offset="9409703">Congress in fact delayed the effective date of the Act for one year in order to allow the board time to set up regulation to implement it or in the words of the house report on page 19, this formulation such “substantive“ regulation so necessary for effective enforcement of the Act”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.342" offset="9488697">What did the board do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.750" offset="9494340">The first thing it did was it set up a task force drawn from the staffs of various Federal Reserve Banks around the country and from its own staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.473" offset="9525269">It drew upon retail credit experts to look at these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.375" offset="9540838">It drew upon vice presidents of various Federal Reserve Banks, the actuary, the treasury was drawn in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.553" offset="9565602">It set up an advisory panel of 20 members representing retailer and lender and consumer groups from every section of the country and headed by the Dean of the Berkley School of Business and after they studied this problem, as I said their solution was the Four Installment Rule, but the board didn't stop there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.861" offset="9638849">On page 19 of our brief in Footnote 22, there is an explanation of what the Four Installment Rule is all about and why the board did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.328" offset="9672704">This is testimony from Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Robinson, it's before the regulations took effect and he is testifying before the very committee of Congress that enacted the Truth in Lending Act and explaining exactly what the board did before the regulations take effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.424" offset="9737070">In that testimony, what I have just described is as far as the promulgating process is concerned, is confirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.195" offset="9768103">The other thing that board did was undertake a massive campaign to inform creditors of exactly what there obligations would be and what the board called Z day which is when Regulation Z took effect in July of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.489" offset="9821288">It distributed a million and half of these pamphlets which describe in detail exactly every creditor's obligations and they were distributed to every known person or firm extending consumer credit in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.748" offset="9870399">The board also ran seminars in the Federal Reserve Bank and the other informational services.</text>

            <text syncTime="2480.193" offset="10024103">They did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.496" offset="10029328">They said, pay only $3.95 down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.053" offset="10043538">The next thing they would have had to do is give the number, amount and due dates of the payments.</text>

            <text syncTime="2497.251" offset="10092335">Of course, if the Truth in Lending Act doesn't apply, the next contract FPS rights could say 395 a month for two-and-half years.</text>

            <text syncTime="3600.347" offset="14504730">It said that the informed use of credit results from an awareness of a cost thereof by consumers and it is the purpose of the Act to disclose that cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="3928.721" offset="15818271">Now, I turn to Section (16) (31) (a) of the Act which is the Page 6(A) of our appendix in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.996" offset="15871352">And this is the general disclosure requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.800" offset="15890578">It says that each creditors , we have already defined each creditor to mean creditors who regularly impose finance charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3955.247" offset="15924328">If such creditor in accordance with regulations prescribed by the board shall disclose to each person to whom credit is extended and upon whom a finance charge is or maybe imposed, the information required under this part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.847" offset="16002800">So not only you start with a class of creditors who imposed finance charges, you go on to those transactions in which they in fact imposed them as congress has wrote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3988.783" offset="16058493">Now, I would like to say a word about maybe there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.938" offset="16071137">There has been some temptation I think, in the briefs for the government and petitioner, suppose that maybe means maybe, perhaps it is there and perhaps it isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="4002.353" offset="16112828">It clearly doesn't mean that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.476" offset="16121292">It is meant that word 'may' as defined in the Act does not carrying forward into the code except the footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4012.595" offset="16153788">'May' is defined as an act that is authorized or permative.</text>
            <text syncTime="4018.297" offset="16176567">In other words, if the contract says you may defer your payments and if you do so after the first 30 days, the interest rate will be 5%, that's a situation in which interest -- finance charge maybe imposed pursuant to the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4035.867" offset="16246888">So to some conditions it's subsequent, but it doesn't mean might be or can't tell whether it's there or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.710" offset="16278235">It doesn't mean maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="4046.612" offset="16289834">Contrary to the government's -- contrary to the petitioner's suggestion at Pages 12 and 13 of its brief, the Act does not impose the disclosure requirements on all credit transactions, even of those who regularly impose finance charges but only in those transactions in which a finance charge was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4072.753" offset="16394428">Now the legislative history behind Section 1631 shed some light at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4081.953" offset="16431208">The Senate and house reports -- the Senate report is quoted at Page 17 and 18 of our brief, say that this language in 1631, the language upon whom finance charges maybe imposed is intended to make clear that disclosure need only be made to persons upon whom finance charges maybe imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4106.149" offset="16527966">Thus the disclosure requirement would not apply to transactions which are not commonly thought of as credit transactions, including trade credit, open account credit, 30, 60, or 90 day credit, etcetera, for which a charge is not made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4127.962" offset="16615215">Congress didn't have to say that, it didn't have to go out of its way to say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4131.807" offset="16630575">It was briefly simple to a middle office language but it has reiterated now three times that what it's talking about is the imposition of a cost of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4145.956" offset="16687208">Finally -- well and ultimately, the Act sets forth, the disclosures are to be made, those are contained in two sections in 1637, which sets forth the disclosures for open ended credit, charge accounts, and that sort of thing, that is not in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.125" offset="16775920">The disclosures required there include the conditions under which a finance charge maybe imposed, the method of determining the balance upon which a finance charge will be imposed, the method of determining the amount of the finance charge, and such like.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.444" offset="16833181">In 1638 which is the section applicable if any is applicable here, they talked about the cash price and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.370" offset="16872887">Going on to the total amount to be financed, the amount of the finance charge, the financed charge expressed as an annual percentage rate and so on.</text>

            <text syncTime="4238.632" offset="17057938">I might say in that connection that 1638 demonstrates the quandary created by imposing, by validating the Four Installment Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4252.570" offset="17113631">Because if the Four Installment Rule applies and you are required to make the disclosures, calls whereby 1638, you are called upon to make a disclosure of your finance charge, and the annual percentage rate, and you are supposed to do it precisely.</text>
            <text syncTime="4272.214" offset="17192208">No one has given us any clue as to how if their economic theory not shared by Congress is correct, how we are supposed to ascertain it, what we have been told is that the Federal Reserve Board doesn't know how to ascertain it and that the whole committee of homers, who opposed these regulations didn't know how to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4292.649" offset="17273919">But we must in hundreds of thousands of transactions each year, do it at (Inaudible) of a liability of $100 to every customer and if criminalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="4305.448" offset="17325119">Now, it is true that the Federal Reserve Board has suggested not by regulation but by the way informally, in the Solicitor General's brief said, well maybe you don't have to disclose the finance charge and the percentage rate, after all if it’s hard to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4324.779" offset="17402441">How that waiver of the requirements of the Act, furthers the purposes of the act, as having brought within the ambit of the Act, a large class of people who everyone thought didn't have finance charges and then say, well you don't have to disclose your finance charges after all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4343.590" offset="17477778">How that furthers the purpose of the disclosure of credit terms, I don't really see.</text>
            <text syncTime="4354.041" offset="17519574">But whether or not the statement by the board that you don't have to make those disclosures would bind Mrs. Mourning in her suit or any of the other people who brought suit or indeed would bind any Grand Jury that wanted to begin a criminal proceedings under this Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert S. Rifkind</label>
            <text syncTime="5583.783" offset="22438536">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5584.409" offset="22441044">I think not because in fact the arrangements with the magazine publisher sort of invoke not just as I understand for Mrs. Mourning but for some substantial group whatever came in that week and I don't know whether she had a pro-rata interest in that, may be as a member of class she does.</text>
            <text syncTime="5605.958" offset="22527248">I think though that, go back to the Manchester Guardian, my news dealer didn't have it in stock either, he had to order it in some place but that didn't make him my creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5616.898" offset="22570924">Similarly, here the fact that FPS doesn't have the magazine or the newspaper in stock doesn't make FPS a bank in a relationship between Mrs. Mourning and Holiday.</text>
            <text syncTime="5654.703" offset="22722226">I also urge that the court may feel that it has to reach the credit issue in all events here because assuming that the government's thesis that somehow there is always a finance charge buried in credit transactions, assuming that has any validity the Four Installment Rule even under that theory could not logically or rationally extend to non-credit situations and if that's what they mean, they mean really to all installment contract situations where there is no necessary or logical implicit finance charge then it means to me the rule has to be over broad by all text.</text>
