            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- this morning in 71-1553, Gilligan against Morgan.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.404" offset="157027">Mr. Martin.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas V. Martin</label>
            <text syncTime="15.052" offset="163610">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.437" offset="177089">The question presented by this case is whether the propriety of the training, weapons and orders should be determined by the Federal Court or by the other branches of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.281" offset="228498">Another question presented by this case is whether injunctive relief against the use of the National Guard or against the use of certain training, weapons or equipment of the guard would constitute an unwarranted interference with a legitimate activity of a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.035" offset="307493">This case arose of the use of the National Guard to control civil disorders which occurred at Kent State University in May of 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.432" offset="349080">The respondents filed suit, the following fall claiming that the Governor had prematurely called the guard to duty, that the conduct of the guard while on duty at Kent State violated the student's constitutional rights and that Section 5923.55 which provides under limited circumstances immunity for members of the National Guard was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.698" offset="462137">Respondents also claimed that the continuance of the same operating methods and procedures of the National Guard under the continued direction of defendants constituted a threat of repetition of injury in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.017" offset="527444">The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.422" offset="557014">The Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed the District Court in its dismissal of two causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.564" offset="585644">However, it found that the complaint did state a claim with respect to the following question.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.284" offset="612498">Whether there was and is a pattern of training, weaponry, and orders of the National Guard which requires or makes inevitable the use of a lethal force in controlling civil disorders where such force is not reasonably necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.446" offset="681148">Petitioners who are the successors in office to defendants below filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to this Court to review the portion of a judgment which reversed the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.132" offset="739871">The issue as framed by the Court of Appeals will require the Court to determine the propriety of the training, weapons and orders of the National Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.337" offset="784697">The resolution of this issue has been committed to the other branches of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.984" offset="811342">Petitioners therefore contend that this issue presents a non-justiciable political question.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.002" offset="839346">All of the factors or formulations which this Court has said, may describe a political question are involved herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.397" offset="876962">There is a demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.769" offset="898487">Article 1, Section 8 of the constitution gives Congress the power to provide for the training and equipment of the National Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.763" offset="934431">The Congress pursuant to this power has enacted legislation which prescribes the proper training, weapons and orders for the National Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.382" offset="980929">Congress has also enacted legislation which delegates to the President, the authority to prescribe regulations and issue orders concerning these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.446" offset="1025128">The President has also acted pursuant to his authority and has prescribed mandatory riot control training requirements for the National Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.114" offset="1079777">Any relief which the District -- which a Federal Court could give would express a lack of respect for the coordinate branches of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.923" offset="1119065">Both Congress and the President have the authority and the responsibility to determine the proper methods of training and equipping the National Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.358" offset="1168802">Any judicial relief which would control these matters would therefore indicate a lack of respect by the Court for these coordinate branches to carryout their responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.025" offset="1223450">Any judicial relief which controlled the training, weapons or orders of the National Guard would also run the risk, create the risk of conflicting pronouncements by the various departments on the same subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.018" offset="1287398">Both Congress and the President have acted pursuant to their authority in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.809" offset="1314565">There is no reason to assume that they will not again so act in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.553" offset="1333582">Any judicial relief as to these matters might create varying or even conflicting directives with future directives from either Congress or the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.530" offset="1389484">These conflicting directives could cause confusion and delay responding to the civil disorders.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.917" offset="1419055">This delay could impede the ability of the state to control the disorders.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.293" offset="1452596">The proper method of training and equipping the National Guard and preparing them to carryout their responsibilities should be made by Congress or the President and not by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.648" offset="1509961">The relief requested by respondents herein shows the need for expertise and specialized knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.123" offset="1539845">The respondents have requested that the use of the National Guard to control disorders be enjoined until it is determined that the training of the members of the National Guard is competent and that they have been provided with the best available nonlethal equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.944" offset="1615182">There is no ready criteria or standard for a Court to determine whether or not the training is competent and whether or not the equipment is the best available.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.234" offset="1660322">The Department of the Army, because of its experience in the area is better able to determine the amount of training that such troops need and the type of training.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.215" offset="1708283">The Department of the Army is also more likely to have knowledge of new developments in theories, in methods on controlling civil disorders and to have knowledge of new developments and new equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.982" offset="1767320">It is also better able to evaluate the effectiveness of such techniques and equipment not only because of its experience, but because it has facilities whereby the techniques and equipment maybe tested under simulated riot conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.641" offset="1841925">In addition, a court cannot provide a continuing supervision and Revision of the training and weapons of the National Guard which is necessary to properly prepare them to perform their functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.351" offset="1900753">The Court is limited and must wait for litigants to bring a case or controversy in order for it to make its determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.560" offset="1949654">Petitioners also contend that the relief requested herein would be an unwarranted interference with a vital activity of the state, preparation for and control civil disorders.</text>

            <text syncTime="525.790" offset="2206490">Mr. Martin, my understanding of the general rule is that the prayer for relief is not a part of the complaint, and therefore, if the District Court is going to dismiss the complaint, it would have to conclude not only that the particular relief sought is not warranted, but that no conceivable type of equitable relief would be warranted?</text>

            <text syncTime="895.375" offset="3684916">The petitioners contend that the same considerations which required denial of injunctive relief against the Governor from prematurely calling the guard to duty should also require denial of injunctive relief against the use of the National Guard until there is a judicial determination as to the propriety of the training, weapons, and orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.614" offset="3777808">In order to control civil disorders, the state must be able to act immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.903" offset="3802990">If it’s required to await a judicial determination, before it can act, the harm could be prevented, could occur without any opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.289" offset="3848547">Petitioners also contend that any relief which would require or prohibit the use of certain training, weapons, or orders of the National Guard would also unduly impair the ability of the state to prepare for and control disorders.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.749" offset="3918346">No one can predict the time, place, size, or type of disorders and no one can predict what measures will be necessary to control.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.730" offset="3970278">The state officials must therefore be given broad discretion to prepare for any eventuality and the state officials must also be given broad discretion to determine under emergency conditions just what methods or techniques should be used to control the disorder.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.549" offset="4045615">Any relief by a Court which would control the training or weapons or orders of the Court would restrict this discretion and thereby impair their ability to prepare for and control disorders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.444" offset="4105174">We believe the instant case is readily distinguishable from the cases relied upon by respondents and cited by the court below which granted injunctive relief against illegal police activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.767" offset="4166405">None of those cases required the Court to review the training, weapons, or orders of the police department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.746" offset="4194408">None of those cases enjoined or required the use of certain training, weapons, or orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.339" offset="4236727">The injunctive relief in those cases was very narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.185" offset="4252087">It was limited to conduct which could not be constitutional or cannot be valid under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.646" offset="4281971">There was therefore a little risk that injunctive relief would inhibit beneficial and lawful police conduct as well as unconstitutional police conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1070.471" offset="4385207">In the instant case on the other hand, the training, weapons and orders of the National Guard are not illegal in themselves and not illegal under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.343" offset="4428779">The basis for the claim that they maybe illegal or maybe unconstitutional is that alleged unconstitutional conduct by the guard resulted therefrom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.015" offset="4483427">Injunctive relief against the training, weapons, or orders of the National Guard could therefore also inhibit lawful conduct by the state and beneficial conduct in controlling disorders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.303" offset="4540583">Petitioners contend that the issue of the training, weapons, and orders of the National Guard has been committed to the other branches of the Federal Government and that these branches of the Federal Government are better able to deal with the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.964" offset="4607248">Petitioners, therefore, respectfully submit that this case presents a non-justiciable political question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1179.681" offset="4822079">The actors there were officers and members of the Ohio National Guard, a state organization acting at that time under state authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.758" offset="4870353">However, the United States Army is responsible for the training of the National Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.287" offset="4896475">Consequently, the United States is much concerned about this case and the possible impact of the decision below and the complications which would inevitably ensue if the Federal Court should undertake to exercise over sight of the training of the National Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.183" offset="4988113">Under the system established by Congress, National Guard units are ordinarily under state command and operational control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.741" offset="5030327">They receive federal financial support though, only if they maintain “Federal Recognition” by meeting prescribed federal standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="1271.166" offset="5188002">The whole business of trying to handle the civil war was largely done through state that raised troops.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.739" offset="5226350">The statute passed by Congress authorizes the President to, again I quote, “prescribe regulations and issue orders necessary to organize, discipline, and govern the National Guard.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.960" offset="5287163">And this is pursuant to the provision of the constitution which gives Congress the power to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia and reserves to the states the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.991" offset="5379323">The provision for uniform, training, or discipline ensures that the militia can be effectively integrated into the regular army if the need arises.</text>

            <text syncTime="1361.726" offset="5550268">The army is naturally, primarily concerned with ensuring that the guard is qualified to serve as a part of the army if called into active federal duty, but the army has also promulgated detailed instructions for civil defense control training and this training program is for National Guardsmen as well as for members of the regular army.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.456" offset="5653191">Beginning in 1971, the army began to give National Guard recruits 16 hours of additional special civil service, civil disturbance control training.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.092" offset="5703764">Now, this special training was initiated in recognition of the fact that guard units are more likely to be called to suppress civil disturbance within our regular army units.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.744" offset="5766353">An important aspect that civil disturbance control training is the rules governing the use of force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.853" offset="5798745">When the guard is in state stages, it is subject to the state's use of force regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.225" offset="5832286">The National Guards of all states, including Ohio, have now voluntarily adopted the federal standards on use of force as their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.779" offset="5874500">At the time of the Kent State incident, however, in May 1970, the Ohio rules were substantially different from the federal rules and different from what they are today.</text>

            <text syncTime="1851.355" offset="7508825">The only prayer in this complaint is for equitable jurisdiction and this appears on Page 10, wherefore plaintiff's request that this Court enter judgment as follows: (a) enjoining defendant roll; (b) enjoining defendant rule; (c) enjoining defendant rule; (d), enjoining defendants and their successors, and finally (e) declaring a section of the Ohio Revised Code to be unconstitutional and void.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.771" offset="7630451">That is a declaratory judgment, but the court below decided that against the respondents here and they did not file any petition and it is not before the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2100.952" offset="8507225">There is at least a problem as to whether a class action can be maintained by persons who are no longer members of the class.</text>

            <text syncTime="2121.860" offset="8590817">Because of the one event, they say that their rights are threatened, but their claim of future harm is wholly speculative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.390" offset="8624880">They base their claim upon the single incident at Kent State in May 1970 and ignored the substantial revisions that have since been made.</text>

            <text syncTime="2149.929" offset="8703039">They allege merely that such an event may occur at some unspecified time in the unstated future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.554" offset="8737625">Now Courts of Equity should not exercise their injunctive power at large in the absence of a more specific threat of potential harm than is alleged here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.598" offset="8785795">Indeed, the case is here in a rather odd and highly artificial posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.589" offset="8813693">The sole relief here, claimed is prospective, equitable, and injunctive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.497" offset="8845354">But (1) the plaintiffs are no longer students; (2) the original defendants are no longer in office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.663" offset="8886000">There is a new Governor, a new Adjutant General, both of whom have made it plain that they do not support the rules upon which action was taken before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.742" offset="8922363">I will remember when in filing a motion to substitute new government officers, you had to get a declaration from them as to whether they propose to continue to follow the same policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.711" offset="8970219">Now, we do it automatically as a matter of course which is probably an improvement, but it’s perfectly plain that the present officers against to whom the injunction is sought do not propose to follow the same policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.193" offset="9020165">The training regulations have been changed and the statute as to which a declaratory judgment was sought has been repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.878" offset="9054856">Much of the talk in the respondents’ brief is about the wrongs that the Governor and the Adjutant General did, but this is not a tort suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.471" offset="9097279">It is, as I have said, solely a suit for an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.405" offset="9112952">To proceed with this case, it seems to me just to make it a sort of phantom case and I have sometimes thought that when I have more time available, I may try to write an article about phantom cases in the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.168" offset="9188080">For example, Bivens decided two years ago was a phantom case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.587" offset="9205739">The actual facts there bear no relation to the issue which was decided by the Court and similarly, last term, Mandel was a phantom case for we knew facts which were not in the record, which made it a very different case than it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.035" offset="9267493">These arise because people filed motions to dismiss and the lower courts as the quickest way to get rid of a case and it seems to me perhaps doubtful and perhaps questionable under the case and controversy standard of the constitution of whether the Court should undertake to decide issues in cases which have become so removed from reality as this one has.</text>

            <text syncTime="2944.464" offset="11881200">Now, the key, the key to the prospective aspect of the case is this specific wrongdoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.499" offset="11909413">It’s in that sense that this case is different from several of the cases in recent years in which the Court has found no standing because of an absence of a past event.</text>

            <text syncTime="2984.019" offset="12039398">But basically, the past event forms the factual basis out of which we conclude in the complaint that very real risk exist of repetition in the event of future demonstrations, future lawful assemblies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.957" offset="12099166">The plaintiffs are as exposed to that as any other person on the Kent State University campus, but students at Kent State University campus at the time of the filing to this complain, were peculiarly exposed to that risk because of what had happened and because of the nature of the relationship of the local police and the National Guard to that community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.922" offset="12195088">It was therefore felt and it is still felt that they are peculiarly susceptible to the same kind of conduct and that the factual basis on which a Court can act has got to be this past conduct in which we seek to prove that certain things were done as alleged and were results of the inadequacies which we alleged to have led to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.741" offset="12294353">That is what makes it a specific controversy as opposed to a law suit in which a plaintiff walks into the Court and says, “I hear the government is doing something, I think it may affect me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.173" offset="12336044">Therefore, I’d like to bring an action.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3100.480" offset="12505318">Now, we’ve complained about a bunch of diverse constitutional deprivations, one of which is shooting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.946" offset="12535202">Now, it is hard to see for the purposes of prospective relief, why the Court would want to require somebody who was actually shot to be the plaintiff, when the key of prospective relief is preventing future shootings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.197" offset="12588178">We say similar things about beatings and about detentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.693" offset="12606151">Now, as to the breakup of lawful assemblies, the complaint does not allege that these plaintiffs were participating in the assemblies which were broken up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.926" offset="12659127">Now, as to that we believe the complaint does not preclude us from proving that they were in fact participants in those lawful assemblies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.976" offset="12703326">In fact, we read the rule of Conley versus Gibson as holding that unless your complaint establishes that your are not in fact capable of proving that which entitles you to relief, then you may not be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.550" offset="12761527">We think that the question of this entitlement as to that item is properly a defensive matter or a matter for a single judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="4509.259" offset="18140453">It has stated a good cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4510.773" offset="18146513">I believe that to this day the only question before this Court is whether it states a good cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4516.806" offset="18170546">If these case were remanded and a factual record made, then this Court would have before it questions of the adequacy of the training, questions which relate to the standing of the plaintiffs, specifically a factual record on the question of eminence.</text>

            <text syncTime="4533.019" offset="18235434">But if the District Judge concluded either that there was no standing or that there was no justiciable question presented or that the issue was moot or all three, then he should not take any evidence, should he?</text>

            <text syncTime="4545.951" offset="18287156">That is right, Your Honor, except for the fact the question of mootness, as the Court framed the issue of mootness in the WT Grant case, there are really two senses in which a case can become moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="4557.582" offset="18333654">The first sense is a pure outright change of law, Hall versus Beals is an example of that kind of case in which the Court concluded the law had changed and therefore the controversy no longer existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4572.599" offset="18393736">The second situation is a situation in which the claimant has put forth that that which was highly likely at a proceeding time is no longer highly likely because of a change in circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4585.164" offset="18443995">That is a factual issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4586.641" offset="18449951">It is an issue to be set decided by a District Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4589.464" offset="18461236">The District Judge as we all know has discretion in granting injunctive relief and it can very well deny injunctive relief on the ground that while he has found wrong doing, he now finds that the circumstances are not such as to warrant the entering even injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4604.980" offset="18523303">That's a District Judge’s function.</text>

            <text syncTime="4606.556" offset="18529573">Would it be a fair characterization of your position that if the case goes back to the District Court, you do not quarrel with the specific regulations now enforced, that (a) you want them made permanent and (b) you want a continuing surveillance to see that they are carried out, is that fair statement of your case?</text>

            <text syncTime="4627.360" offset="18612851">That is a fair statement of what we are seeking at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4631.299" offset="18628524">Understanding that at the time the complaint was filed, we were seeking a more specific change in what then existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4638.942" offset="18659140">Your Honor, there is one further point which has come up on couple of occasions and I have never really specifically addressed myself to and that is the relationship of Laird versus Tatum to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4651.786" offset="18710549">The Solicitor General in his brief has gone to some length to demonstrate the way in which this case is like Laird.</text>
            <text syncTime="4660.231" offset="18744299">We think this case is different from Laird in several respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="4663.106" offset="18755793">Laird was basically a case in which the conduct of the defendants were not itself unlawful and did not in itself involve a deprivation of a constitutional right, but it was alleged that the chilling effect of the defendants’ conduct created the deprivation of constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4684.729" offset="18842311">So, what it was, it was an attempt to bootstrap from an injury into a deprivation of a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4692.553" offset="18873553">Now, irrespective of what I personally may think about that in the privacy area, this case is crucially different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.682" offset="18902079">First of all, it is different in the sense that the people that are subjected to the kinds of injuries that occurred here and which we see as possibly appearing in the future or the opposite of the people who were going to be chilled, they are the people who actually participate in the assemblies and so we believe that that first of all chilling effect as to these people is really not pertinent to the question of injury here or to the question of whether or not the complaint states a wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="4731.717" offset="19030288">That's the first different the way in which the case is different from Laird.</text>
            <text syncTime="4735.159" offset="19043976">The second way, in which the case is different from Laird lies in the fact that this case alleges an injury which is very specific in nature and which has been held by preceding cases to give rise to a constitutional deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4753.771" offset="19118477">That is one who is unjustifiably killed by Government action is in fact subjected to a deprivation of the constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4762.410" offset="19153063">So, that the inquiry into the defendants’ conduct stems from a specific constitutional right as opposed to the Laird case in which there is no specific constitutional right, but the subject, the feeling of injury is said to be enough to lead to the finding of a constitutional deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4782.613" offset="19233834">I think that is a very substantial difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4785.016" offset="19243447">There is one further aspect of Laird which I would like to call the Court’s attention and that is the assumption that the assumption present in this case which we have come to on a couple of our occasions that the nature of the training will be adequate to assure that the new rules of engagement are in fact more forth to choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4810.916" offset="19346996">We have heard a good deal on the way of assurances from the defendants, there is more on the briefs and what we see in Laird about this is that exactly, very similar kinds of assurances were made to the Court at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4825.211" offset="19404257">Specifically, there are assurances with respect to the retention of documents etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="4832.863" offset="19434872">It was then found by a senate committee that documents had not in fact been retained.</text>
            <text syncTime="4839.196" offset="19460159">We believe that all of these matters, matters with respect to what the orders are and how they are implemented are purely matters of proof and therefore specifically functions for a District rather than in appellate Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4853.567" offset="19517628">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
