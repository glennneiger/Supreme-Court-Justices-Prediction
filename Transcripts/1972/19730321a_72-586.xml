            <text syncTime="14.182" offset="160057">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.346" offset="172805">This is an action in habeas corpus in which the Court Appeals for the Seventh Circuit granted Dombrowski the respondent a writ from his imprisonment in Wisconsin for murder unless the State elects to retry Dombrowski.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.850" offset="246784">Dombrowski was convicted of murder in 1968 in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.083" offset="275728">An appeal was taken to the Wisconsin Supreme Court which affirmed that a collateral attack was made on that judgment in the District Court of Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.724" offset="330271">Habeas corpus was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.770" offset="346467">The case went to the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.529" offset="369455">On September 9, 1967, Mr. Dombrowski who was an off-duty Chicago policeman drove his 1960 Dodge automobile to his brother’s farm near Kewaskum, Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.825" offset="430686">That evening, the car became disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.264" offset="444479">In the following afternoon, he had it towed to his brother’s farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.178" offset="464123">He left it there and returned to Chicago with his brother that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.329" offset="496724">At 12:30 a.m., the following morning, that’s September 11, he rented a 1967 red Thunderbird at the O’Hare Airport in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.403" offset="560985">At 10:30 that night, still the 11th, he was involved in an accident near Kewaskum, Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.461" offset="605184">He called the Sheriff’s Department and two officers picked him up in the Village of Kewaskum and went to the scene of the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.200" offset="640188">He informed them that he was a Chicago police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.692" offset="662131">They found the car off to the highway and they called for a wrecker, and Officer Bowdry did a cursory inspection of the interior of the vehicle to see if his service revolver was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.183" offset="740080">It was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.049" offset="747604">The vehicle was towed to the garage at Kewaskum where it was parked outside of the garage and Dombrowski was taken to the Sheriff’s office in West Bend. He was later charged with drunk driving, became incoherent and was at the hospital being checked by a doctor, unable to communicate with the doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.734" offset="866304">An officer Weiss, the other officer who had been on the Sheriff’s department for five-and-a-half months decided that in view of the fact that this man was a Chicago police officer, he very likely had that gun somewhere in his vehicle and he should go back and look for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.010" offset="947388">So, he drove back to the unattended vehicle, opened up the front door, looked in the front end and found a Book of Rules of the Chicago Police Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.306" offset="1008619">Obviously, feeling then that he was on the right track because if a man carries his rulebook, he probably has his other paraphernalia of his police officer status, he opened the trunk still looking for the gun but he found bloody material including officer’s pants, a nightstick covered with blood and a tarp, a floor tarp from a Dodge automobile.</text>

            <text syncTime="885.505" offset="3645419">Whenever the body is injured in a vital area such as the brain or the heart, the rest of the body works and creates terrific pressure to send blood to that emergency area and so you can imagine that blood was spurting out of this wound every time his heart beat.</text>

            <text syncTime="1043.959" offset="4279254">Now, the Seventh Circuit, I think made a serious error in finding that the under sheriff had executed the search warrant at the farm when he went out and looked into the Dodge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.940" offset="4351143">There was testimony that he opened the door and looked in.</text>
