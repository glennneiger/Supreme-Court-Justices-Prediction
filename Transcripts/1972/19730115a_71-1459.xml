            <label>Mr. William Bradford Reynolds</label>
            <text syncTime="25.625" offset="205824">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.162" offset="220035">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.456" offset="245217">The action was instituted by the United States to acquire its title to lands in the State of Louisiana which it had acquired some years ago by deed and condemnation for use as a wildlife refuge.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.287" offset="304567">The relevant events leading to commencement of this lawsuit can be briefly summarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.318" offset="328600">In 1916, the United States and Great Britain ratified a treaty for the purpose of protecting the many species of birds that customarily migrate at different seasons of the year between Canada and United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.619" offset="393801">Among the several protections enumerated in the treaty was the establishment of wildlife refuges both here and in Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.160" offset="432044">In 1929, Congress in furtherance of a national program for the protection of wildlife enacted the Migratory Bird Conservation Act, implementing in part the treaty between this country and Great Britain.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.019" offset="495470">The Act which is set forth in our brief at pages 19 to 23 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior among other things to acquire lands deemed valuable for wildlife refuges upon attaining the consent of the State in which the acreage is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.542" offset="573524">Pursuant to this authority, the United States in 1937 entered in the contract negotiations with Little Lake Misere Land Company for the purchase of some 10,048 acres of undeveloped marshland located in the State of Louisiana to form a park of the Lacassine Wildlife Refuge.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.117" offset="667878">On July 23, 1937, the United States acquired this acreage from Lake Misere by deed of purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.784" offset="706539">The deed contained a Reservation Clause which is set out in the appendix of page 25, pertaining to “all the oil, gas, sulphur, and other minerals in, on, and, under the land.”</text>
            <text syncTime="169.314" offset="780622">By its terms, it reserved to Lake Misere, and again I quote, “the right of investigating, exploring, prospecting, drilling, and mining for and producing the said oil, gas, sulphur, and other minerals” for a period of ten years from the date of the deed.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.310" offset="868603">It further provided that at the end of the 10-year period, the company, if it was then conducting drilling operations or actually producing minerals could continue to do so until it seized drilling for 60 consecutive days or until its mineral production seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.276" offset="948433">The United States and Lake Misere agreed in addition that if Lake Misere was not conducting mining operations on the land at the end of the 10-year period of reservation, “the right to mine, produce and market the said oil, gas, sulphur, and other minerals shall terminate and the complete fee title to said land shall thereby become vested in the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="243.711" offset="1078209">The United States agreed to pay an excess of $40,000 for the acreage.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.322" offset="1100675">Approximately two years later, it obtained for the refuge an additional 2,574 acres of marshlands from Lake Misere in the same area by a condemnation judgment entered in 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.281" offset="1160547">The United States paid an excess of $12,000 compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.726" offset="1186252">The condemnation judgment contained a 10-year reservation provision that was in all material respects, identical to the one that the parties have included in the earlier deed of purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.011" offset="1239437">Both conveyances also provided that the United States would receive from Lake Misere royalty payments from minerals removed from the Government lands during the period of reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.253" offset="1292413">Now, at the time that these conveyances were negotiated and entered into, it is agreed that the laws of Louisiana recognized mineral reservation of the sort just described as providing for what was called a period of contractual prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.823" offset="1366706">The word prescription refers essentially to non-use or inactivity and has the legal effect of cutting off an existing interest or servitude for the failure to exercise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.706" offset="1422190">The servitude in essence lapses for non-use or in more technical terms, terminates by force of prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.756" offset="1462418">Under the Louisiana Civil Code, the period of non-use cannot extend beyond 10 years but any period up to and including 10 years may be designated by contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.460" offset="1521246">In 1937 and 1939, when these conveyances were completed, there was no restriction under Louisiana law on the right of the United States or anyone else to agree to a period of contractual prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.874" offset="1590836">A mineral deed, a mineral reservation and a deed of purchase that was by its terms to terminate in time because of non-use was as enforceable under Louisiana law by the United States if no mining had occurred as by any private party to a land contract and that was the clear understanding of the United States and Lake Misere at the time that they agreed to the land transactions involved here and bargained for the reservation of a mineral servitude for a period of 10 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="685.166" offset="2844087">The Louisiana Court in construing the statute, as I indicated, declared that it was applicable both to statutory and contractual prescription but there is one exception with respect to contractual prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.749" offset="2898317">If the contract specified as servitude for a term of definite duration as opposed to one of indefinite or uncertain duration, then the Act was inapplicable.</text>

            <text syncTime="728.972" offset="3019212">And this litigation arose because of Lake Misere’s claim that the agreed terms of the reservation in the deed of purchase and the condemnation judgment were rendered inoperative by the subsequently enacted imprescriptible legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.916" offset="3087026">There’s no dispute here that Lake Misere was not conducting any mining operations on the bird refuge at the end of the 10-year period and that it had not either before or after the agreed cut off dates conducted any such mining activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.579" offset="3157661">The Federal District Court felt itself bound by the earlier two-to-one decision of the Fifth Circuit in the Leiter Minerals case and held Louisiana 315 of 1940 to be applicable to the mineral reservations in this earlier 1937 and 1939 conveyances.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.722" offset="3234252">The Court of Appeals affirmed on the authority of Leiter Minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.068" offset="3259643">Initially, we disagree with the Court of Appeals that the mineral servitudes in these conveyances were of indefinite duration so as to be imprescriptible under Louisiana Act 315 even assuming that Act’s application here.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.853" offset="3318784">Our reasons are discussed in detail in our main brief on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.868" offset="3338846">But if the Fifth Circuit was correct in that respect, an application of Louisiana Act 315 to cut off the prescriptive rights of the United States that have been bargained for, validly agreed to, and purchased prior to enactment of the legislation would we submit violates several provisions of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.040" offset="3431528">It would abrogate expressed terms of the reservation in these conveyances as they were understood by the parties at the time that the transaction were entered into and thus would impair, the obligations of contracts in violation of Article 1, Section 10 of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.491" offset="3505298">More particularly and with specific reference to the fact that we deal here with land acquisitions by the United States, an application of 315 -- Act 315, would contravene the Property Clause of the Constitution which vest the power in Congress to dispose of and regulate property belonging to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.536" offset="3605504">Since the Landmark decision in McCulloch versus Maryland, it’s been a basic principle of our constitutional jurisprudence that the affirmative grants of legislative power in the Constitution are to be broadly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.458" offset="3665168">And consistently, this Court has held that the Article 4 power of Congress with respect to the regulation and disposition of federal property is exclusive and unlimited.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.598" offset="3713755">It does works for Congress and Congress alone to legislate with respect to the disposition of the valuable mineral interest that the United States had acquired under these conveyances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1278.586" offset="5217677">The minerals themselves are part of the realty and therefore the United States thus have more than a hope for expectancy as a real interest at the time that it acquires that realty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.502" offset="5269400">But I think that whatever the technical characterization of this interest, I think that under general federal law principles that it’s a future interest that certainly is a vested interest that the Government is entitled to at the termination of the 10-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.115" offset="5351842">And therefore, it is a property interest belonging to the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1330.485" offset="5425298">The Government under the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands can lease a future interest in mineral deposits under its lands and the disposition of that future interest in mineral deposits is now by the State’s statute if applied retroactively taken away from the Government and we don’t think that that is a -- w e think whatever the technical characterization under Louisiana law, that we have a property interest here of the Government’s that is only for disposition by the Government under Article 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.875" offset="5574823">I think, in addition to that, that the reservation in the conveyances that these parties agreed to, contemplated that the Government would have this interest in the future and that the 10-year mineral servitude would be prescriptible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.456" offset="5653191">Under the Contracts Clause, we think that what a retroactive application of Louisiana Act 315 does is abrogate the expressed terms of the reservation and that is an impairment of the obligation of contracts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1433.275" offset="5836466">It would terminate and it could no longer come on the land.</text>

            <text syncTime="1635.435" offset="6645112">I think that this case is somewhat more complicated than the average one because I don’t believe the Government and respondents are together on what issues are before the Court here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.450" offset="6697148">We consider on the issue of question that there are two and only two issues before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.235" offset="6732361">One is, do these servitudes involved here, these mineral reservations, do they fit the definition established by the Louisiana Supreme Court of a case of contractual prescription, so as to make effect to them Act 315 of 1940?</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.047" offset="6803519">That’s question one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.133" offset="6811878">Then if they do in the Act did so applied to them, then Mr. Chief Justice, I think, there is a reason to be here before you today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.895" offset="6846986">As so applied, do they violate any provision of the United States Constitution?</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.547" offset="6869556">We think that those are the only two issues before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.757" offset="6882408">And I think to clarify that we should go back and get into more detail about the history of the Leiter Minerals litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.995" offset="6923368">In 1957, the case was before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.968" offset="6939251">A majority of the Court was Justice Douglas dissenting considered the Act 315 in 1940 and said expressly that before we rule on the Constitution at nullity of that Act, they sent it back it to the State Court, got an opinion on what Act was passed, what’s its effect and is it constitutional under state law.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="1730.826" offset="7026709">Could that result conceivably have disposed of the matter without any problems of federal law coming in?</text>

            <label>Mr. Austin W. Lewis</label>
            <text syncTime="1737.745" offset="7054399">Well, Your Honor, I can see no reason at all to have sent this case back to one meritoriously back to the Courts and it got up to the Court of Appeals and was compromised into that of Leiter Minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.416" offset="7101001">Had the Court at that time, taken counsel’s argument and said that federal law and not the Louisiana law should apply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.493" offset="7129318">It could have been disposed of at that hearing and then nothing else to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.375" offset="7144887">Now, Justice Douglas in rather picturesque language in his dissent in that case suggested that the Court was beating the devil around the bush by not going ahead and deciding it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.910" offset="7190967">And he said that as I interpret his dissent not on the question of whether state law or federal law should be applied but that the Court was counting to apply either one of them without sending it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.892" offset="7230986">Having just taken the case away from the state court to begin with, and if I may borrow Justice Douglas’ language, I would respectfully suggest that would beat the devil around the bush some seven times since that time if as a result of this hearing today state law is going to be ignored and federal law is going to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.441" offset="7313115">There have been five, I believe, bigger decisions in the Leiter case and two in this all based on the applicability of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1815.195" offset="7364106">Your Honor, I would get to that at the moment but I’ll answer you briefly now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.113" offset="7383855">The statute has been construed by the Louisiana Supreme Court in two occasions to be retrospective in effect and to be constitutional as so applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.284" offset="7432547">So, if we are going to take half of Louisiana law, I think we have to take the other half too then testing it only against the provision of the United States Constitution which I’ll deal with later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.362" offset="7484792">But if the Louisiana law is the guiding law and I feel so strong it is, then part of that law is that this is a remedial right only, same as the cause of action and that it can be lengthened or shortened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.408" offset="7560965">It has been done both the Louisiana Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.976" offset="7567235">It has been shortened as well lengthened and upheld and both in doing that and upheld as a retrospective law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.593" offset="7613733">Now, the suggestion of the Solicitor General that some federal law should be applied here, leaving out Leiter and leaving out cases we’ve cited in our brief, United States versus Fox, United States versus Yazell, a more recent case, holding it where isolated land transactions were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.009" offset="7687398">The law of the situs State does apply to the exclusion of any federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.682" offset="7714147">But I asked myself during the time of the history of this case, if the Court pleases, if federal law has to be applied, what federal law?</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.192" offset="7752182">Here we have a complete similar concept we’re dealing with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.550" offset="7769527">That mineral reservation procured the Louisiana and not true with any other 49 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.655" offset="7793977">So, where would we find that federal law?</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.802" offset="7802546">In its reply brief which I just received over the weekend, the Government attempts to answer that on page 11 and that suggests that have no difficulty in fashioning a federal common law to apply in these circumstances and then admittedly citing Thompson on Real Property and citing the Common Law Approach that the State version is always the vested interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.914" offset="7923022">For my civil law advantage, if the Court pleases, I read that with the sense of almost far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.477" offset="7949249">It’s just completely foreign to our concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.193" offset="7960116">Our Courts has squarely held that this right or expectancy to obtain a reversion of these minerals is not on State at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.420" offset="7993031">It’s not a property interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.690" offset="7998151">It can even be solved and therefore the Courts have held that you can validly cut across the limitation period or prescriptive period as running against that servitude and that expectancy at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.177" offset="8076100">Now, one mentioned by Mr. Reynolds in his argument, their brief suggests that the Migratory Bird Act has some legal significance in this case to assist in the application of federal law and to bring into place some of the constitutional issues that were raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.104" offset="8163767">I believe in the last reply brief, they’ve already receded from that but we submit that the statute did just the obsolete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.907" offset="8195009">While we concede as some of the attorneys in the case have precedingly did, that Congress could have preempted this field, just a mere casual reading and that statute shows that it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.250" offset="8240358">It specifically preserved the jurisdiction rights of the State and the statute itself.</text>
