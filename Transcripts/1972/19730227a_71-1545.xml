            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="27.189" offset="212093">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.397" offset="224946">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.873" offset="246888">The issue presented is whether the court below exceeded the permissible scope of review in setting aside the Secretary’s 20-day suspension of respondent as a registrant under the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.088" offset="307702">The suspension was ordered, pursuant to the Secretary’s authority to suspend for a reasonable period any registrant committing any violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.787" offset="354513">Respondent is a livestock broker for a market agency, who is paid a sales commission for conducting an auction of which livestock is sold on a weight basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.043" offset="399548">Respondent has now been detected violating the Act on four separate occasions by short-weighing cattle consigned to it for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.515" offset="437478">On the earlier occasions, it had simply been warned against future violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.851" offset="458794">On the fourth instance of short-weighing, which is the subject of this suit, a formal complaint against respondent was issued by the Packers and Stockyards Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.585" offset="505710">The case was initially tried before Department of Agriculture Hearing Examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.497" offset="525354">It found that respondent had intentionally short-weighed the cattle consigned to it for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.755" offset="550431">The Hearing Examiner recommended an appropriate cease and desist order and also a 30-day suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.039" offset="579480">The matter was then reviewed by a judicial officer having authority to act on behalf of the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.552" offset="609573">He found that respondent short-weighing constituted a willful violation of the Act and he issued the cease and desist order recommended by the Hearing Examiner, but he reduced respondent’s suspension to only 20 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.485" offset="665266">Since the respondent operates its market only one day per week, this 20-day suspension will affect at most three business days.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.626" offset="705912">Before discussing the disposition of this case on appeal, I think it will be helpful to describe the respondent’s brokerage function as a market agency and to explain why a market agency like the respondent might intentionally short-weigh the cattle consigned to it for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.538" offset="777488">The sellers at respondent’s auctions are typically livestock producers, who bring or send their cattle to the respondent for purposes of the auction.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.609" offset="817821">These livestock producers rarely know the true weight of their cattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.532" offset="833494">They typically lack the weighing facilities necessary to determine the true weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.108" offset="855855">It is the respondent who is responsible for weighing the cattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.315" offset="876648">The buyers at the auction frequently, perhaps usually, are representatives of meatpacking companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.117" offset="903816">They buy the cattle at the weight given by the respondent and the cattle are then shipped to the packing plants where they are reweighed.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.841" offset="934745">The sad truth of the matter is that the packers tend to patronize the auctions held by market agencies, which give them a favorable break on the weight, thus, short-weighing encourages buyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.244" offset="988348">And this in turn stimulates an increase in sales, for the livestock producers will tend to patronize the markets which attract sufficient buyers to ensure a sale of their cattle, and since the market agencies are paid on a per head basis, they profit from this higher level of sales.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="240.278" offset="1064521">They don't -- their commission isn't based on a percentage of the sale price?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="keith_a_jones" startTime="245.096" stopTime="268.521">
            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="245.096" offset="1083747">It's based -- and I think that in the record there is a schedule of the commission, that is based in part on the weight of the cattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.075" offset="1115721">If the cattle in question weighs 400 pounds or more, I think the sales commission is $4 and some odd cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.198" offset="1152188">If it is between 300 and 399 pounds, it is a lower figure, and so forth.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="268.521" stopTime="272.044">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="268.521" offset="1177475">To that extent then it would be against their interest to short-weigh?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="keith_a_jones" startTime="272.044" stopTime="325.615">
            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="272.044" offset="1191581">Only if the short-weighing brought the weight down from 100-weight category into a lower one and in fact, in this case, none of the cattle short-weighed in fact brought the weight down from 100-weight category to another, so that there was no loss in commissions resulting from the short-weighing.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.603" offset="1277785">Now, the Packers and Stockyards Act was of course designed to eliminate abuses such as short-weighing.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.326" offset="1304639">It does this by requiring the market agencies to observe a high fiduciary standard of care in dealing with both buyers and sellers.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.828" offset="1342673">And since negligent as well as intentional short-weighing injures the livestock producers, negligent short-weighing has long been considered to be a violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.718" offset="1386245">I turn now to the treatment of this case in the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="325.615" offset="1405785">Is there any concession here by Glover, however, that the short-weighed was not due to negligence in this case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="keith_a_jones" startTime="336.032" stopTime="346.512">
            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="336.032" offset="1447476">No, I believe that they have consistently maintained that their infractions of the Act where not intentional.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.421" offset="1481017">On appeal, the Court of Appeals --</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="354.087" offset="1519679">Yes, we do distinguish between intentional and willful as did the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.891" offset="1538905">The Act is phrased in terms of willfulness and the negligent violations are considered willful for purposes of the Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="373.142" offset="1595956">Well, I believe that it means that if you act in careless disregard of your statutory responsibilities, that's considered to be willfulness for purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.538" offset="1637543">It simply means that you know what your responsibilities are and you don't live up to them.</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="390.183" offset="1664084">Well, I suppose that in this context, intentional would mean that, for example, the respondent ordered its weigh master to weigh the cattle at less then their true weight.</text>

          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="400.063" stopTime="406.089">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="400.063" offset="1703581">And there is no concession for it being intentional?</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="406.089" offset="1727718">That's correct.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="406.633" stopTime="409.943">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="406.633" offset="1729912">Is there a concession that they were willful?</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="409.943" offset="1743182">I believe so, in the sense that the respondent has conceded that the suspension here was within the statutory authority of the Secretary, and of course, it would not be if the act where not committed willfully, in other words, not a violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.192" offset="1812146">Furthermore, the Court of Appeals upheld the finding of a violation as supported by substantial evidence, and the respondent is not crossed petitioned in this case, so that the finding of a violation of the Act is not at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.462" offset="1877243">However, although the Court of Appeals sustained the cease and desist order --</text>

            <text syncTime="447.739" offset="1894379">As a matter of fact, did we limit the grant here only to the remedy?</text>

            <text syncTime="464.305" offset="1960626">The only issue presented of course is whether the suspension itself was -- whether the court exceeded its permissible scope of reviewing in setting the sentence of suspension.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="472.852" stopTime="476.464">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="472.852" offset="1994794">There really is only one issue in the case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="keith_a_jones" startTime="476.464" stopTime="743.534">
            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="476.464" offset="2009213">And that's the proper scope of reviewing how it is applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.531" offset="2025514">Well, the court did set aside the 20-day suspension here.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.975" offset="2039306">It is hard to determine just why the suspension was set aside however.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.665" offset="2058010">The court expressly held that the suspension was within the Secretary's statutory authority, and it further acknowledged that the shaping of remedies is peculiarly within the special competence of the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.977" offset="2111300">Having acknowledged its narrow powers of review however, the court turned to a comparison of this case with four previous administrative decisions involving suspensions for short-weighing.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.080" offset="2159679">In each of those four cases, at least in the court’s view, the short-weighing had been intentional and flagrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.701" offset="2190190">The court did not view the respondent’s offense as being equally culpable, and on the basis of this comparison alone, the court concluded that the 20-day suspension here failed to achieve uniformity of sanctions for similar violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.425" offset="2249122">In so concluding, the court overlooked the fact that in those four cases with which it was comparing the present case, the suspensions there had all been for 30 days; longer than the period of suspension here.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.597" offset="2301785">And the court further overlooked the fact that the Secretary has frequently imposed suspensions in cases involving offenses no more culpable than those committed by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.802" offset="2350582">The court then made its own independent evaluation of the proper sanction to be imposed and concluded that the cease and desist order, when coupled with the adverse publicity, which had attended the finding of a violation, would be inadequate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.548" offset="2413589">It is our position that the Court of Appeals merely paid lip service to the applicability of a narrow standard of review, and that it in fact substituted its own judgment for that of the Secretary with respect to the proper sanction to be employed for short-weighing under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.585" offset="2481716">I'll first outline our review of what constitutes the proper standard of review in cases such as this and then turn to a discussion of how that standard should be applied to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.851" offset="2534797">This Court has repeatedly stressed that the courts exercise only a very limited power of review over orders fashioned by an administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.528" offset="2569488">This limited power of review has normally been described as requiring the courts to sustain an administrative action, which is authorized by statute and which is not arbitrary capricious or an abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.155" offset="2628002">Although, in articulating the proper standard to be applied, the Court has varied its language slightly from case to case.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.151" offset="2656005">The essential point has remained clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.723" offset="2666245">A reviewing court may not simply substitute its discretion for that of the administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.657" offset="2689964">When discretionary enforcement powers are given by Congress to the administrator, who thereupon develops special expertise over the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.471" offset="2725282">A reviewing court may not replace its discretion, I mean, may not replace the administrator’s discretion with its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.115" offset="2759868">And we believe that a narrow scope of review is particularly appropriate where the administrative action in question is the imposition of sanctions for statutory violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.427" offset="2805112">The determination of what sanction is necessary to ensure compliance with the Act and to deter future violations must be based upon informed judgment which can properly be made only by the administrator, who unlike the reviewing court is thoroughly familiar with both the conditions in the industry and the real significance of the particular violation, or the sanction chosen by the administrator can be shown to have some reasonable relationship to his legitimate enforcement objectives under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.218" offset="2936247">We contend that the sanction must be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.773" offset="2950457">We believe that a party attacking the sanction bears a very heavy burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.141" offset="2971982">That party mush show that the sanction bears no relationship whatsoever to the effectuation of the statutory program, and is out of all proportion to the seriousness of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.009" offset="3019421">And when as in this case, the sanction employed is a suspension, we believe that, that sanction maybe modified or set aside only when the period of suspension is wholly lacking in reasonableness.</text>

            <text syncTime="831.628" offset="3429857">I think that the court gave lip service to in their standard of review, but that it did not attempt conscientiously to apply that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.559" offset="3485654">The violation committed by the respondent here, the short-weighing of cattle consigned to it for sale is a serious offense under the Act, and furthermore, this was not the respondent’s first violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.537" offset="3537481">It is been detected short-weighing on a total of four separate occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.188" offset="3556080">These repeated violations may as the respondent seems to contend have been merely due to negligence, carelessness.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.438" offset="3589099">If so, the respondent has repeatedly been careless in the observance of its statutory responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.643" offset="3617938">On the other hand, the violations may have been intentional.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.120" offset="3631835">The record is unclear and the Secretary’s findings are couched only in terms of willfulness, which is the statutory standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.642" offset="3661928">Whether intentional or careless, respondent’s actions thwarted the fundamental safeguard devised by Congress for the protection of livestock producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.759" offset="3698395">In contrast to the seriousness of the offense, the 20-day suspension here is relevantly mild.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.734" offset="3722324">It certainly cannot be said in the context of the respondent’s repeated violations that this brief suspension was arbitrary or lacking in reasonableness or an abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.169" offset="3764015">Congress has given the Secretary wide discretion to choose the sanctions necessary to ensure compliance with the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.044" offset="3791600">The Secretary in this case acted well within his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.260" offset="3808423">The court below however was concerned with whether there had been a uniformity of sanctions for similar violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.836" offset="3838725">Now, I would now -- first that we believe the court was in error in concluding that there was a lack of uniformity here.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.604" offset="3869759">The Department of Agriculture has provided us and opposing counsel with a comprehensive list of short-weighing cases, including 152 cases involving suspensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.554" offset="3921586">Now, these suspensions range in length from a minimum of one week to a maximum of five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.210" offset="3948231">Now, some of the violations were more obviously intentional than those involved here, but many were not, so that if the history of the enforcement of the Act is any guide, the sanctions here were if anything lenient, certainly no severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.757" offset="4010402">But more importantly, we would submit that the court fundamentally erred and inquired, at least in any strict and comprehensive way into the uniformity of sanctions at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.998" offset="4055333">The Secretary is not required to impose the same sanction for all similar violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.782" offset="4082500">In Federal Communications Commission against WOKO, which we cite in our brief, the court was once before confronted with the argument that an administrator had not applied similarly harsh sanctions to violators in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.449" offset="4141119">In holding that this factor is not a ground for ejecting the sanction, the court replied, and I quote, on page 228 of that volume, “We cannot say that the commission is bound to deal with all cases at all times, as it dealt with some that seemed comparable.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.010" offset="4215411">We believe that the same answer is appropriate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.933" offset="4227114">Even if it is assumed that respondent’s suspension was harsher than those meted out in the past, the Secretary’s action we believe should be measured not against any past leniency, but only against the need to effectuate the statutory program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.443" offset="4285106">So Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I believe that is the answer to your inquiry about whether merely the verbalization of an abuse of discretion would be adequate, we believe it is necessary to show that there is no reasonable relationship between the sanction and the need to effectuate the statutory program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.601" offset="4357726">The conclusion of the court’s opinion below illustrates that the court was actually substituting its own judgment for that of the Secretary in not really finding an abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.383" offset="4404955">The court expressed its view that the cease and desist order, plus routine press releases describing the finding of the violation “would certainly seem appropriate and reasonable with respect to the practice the department seeks to eliminate.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.133" offset="4467858">This statement by the court reveals at least two serious errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.644" offset="4481964">First, it is for the Secretary and not the court to determine what constitutes an appropriate and reasonable sanction for purposes of carrying out the Secretary’s enforcement obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.358" offset="4532851">And secondly, Congress has made the legislative judgment that a suspension is appropriate and reasonable for any violation of the Act an a fortiori for the serious violation of short-weighing involved here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1493.469" offset="6077210">The Government is correct on that, but they have no more conception of what those three working days are to us, to anything in this world.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.807" offset="6114617">What those three working days amount to, I think Chief -- Mr. Justice Leah in the Eight Circuit Court of Appeals very aptly put it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.140" offset="6151920">They amount to calling us crooks, and we are not crooks and that's what we stand before this Court on today.</text>

            <text syncTime="1536.584" offset="6249723">In the first place, the government says that we were warned four times, and each of those instances -- three times, and in each of those instances, we had the government’s own weighing team to check our scales, and they couldn't report anything wrong to us because there they used the four edges of balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.103" offset="6331747">That's what the record shows. It was only when we tore those scales down that we found out what was wrong with the scales, or what could have been wrong with the scales.</text>

            <text syncTime="1602.604" offset="6513768">If Your Honor would look at Appendix A to the petition for writ of certiorari, on Page 16, you would find Glover is an operator of a posted stockyard in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, registered so forth, to sell livestock, honored by June 2, 1964, July 26, 1966, and June 20, 1967, representatives of the USDA conducted investigations of so forth and so on, and it goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.030" offset="6627453">Then on Page 19, it also points out in another place that these matters where brought to the attention of the Eight Circuit Court of Appeals, and they mentioned them in their finding and in their decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.774" offset="6710418">We would respectfully point out also that in three of those instances, there was no evidence taken, nothing, other than to say you're not weighing properly, and we called in a scale examiner, one who was approved by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.126" offset="6787845">They could give us no answers. The Agricultural Department made no effort to give us any answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.777" offset="6822431">So consequently, when it came to the Eight Circuit Court of Appeals, we have had a situation where the Eight Circuit Court of Appeals found specifically that it was not an intentional and flagrant violation, and that also is in the Eight Circuit Court of Appeals opinion, if it please Your Honor, it's on Page 9 of our brief, but I am sure it's in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.564" offset="6937579">I didn't go to that trouble to find it out, but most assuredly, they found no intentional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.444" offset="6973106">We have had a situation that I would like to bring to the attention of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.595" offset="6993795">The word unconscionable has come in, and Mr. Jones states the really the Eight Circuit didn't give any reason for that word, but gentlemen, they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.046" offset="7043532">They most assuredly did, in the last paragraph of their opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.729" offset="7062340">They pointed out exactly why they thought it was unconscionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.394" offset="7076968">I don't think there is any doubt about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.103" offset="7087835">They found out that these press releases which Mr. Jones a few moments ago says, I've forgotten what he called them, routine press releases I believe, well, we're in the unenviable position that we found out we had been charged with an offense in the newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.832" offset="7186683">Everything that was done in this case was in the newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.618" offset="7209880">Routine press releases, if they be routine, they damaged us, they damaged us to the point that truthfully and honestly, if it wasn't at my own insistence, we wouldn't be here today because we're not financially able to be here, but we're here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.758" offset="7294412">We're still saying we didn't intentionally do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.115" offset="7311862">We didn't intentionally do it and we're not crooks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.151" offset="7327953">That's what it amounts to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.102" offset="7335790">Now they say we short-weighed cattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.474" offset="7345298">There were 29 drafts, I believe it was proven to have been weighed, whether or not those cattle had any access to water, which would have caused them to gain weight or not, I am not in the position to say, but if it please you Justices, neither was the government, because they weren't there either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.909" offset="7427009">I know one thing, of the 29 drafts weighed, nine were underweighed, nine were overweighed, and the rest were right on the spot, and I want to say to you that of the nine underweighed, two of them, two out of the nine belonged to one of my clients, who is selling his own cattle to the Livestock Commission Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.326" offset="7540694">In other words, if anybody got cheated on those two, it was Thomas Glover who owns part of Glover Livestock Commission Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.365" offset="7580818">Now, that doesn't make sense to me that we would intentionally cheat ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.209" offset="7604224">Now, the government has used the argument that I have heard since the first day we heard this before a Hearing Examiner, and let me digress just one minute and say that the way we heard this matter is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.349" offset="7672769">The government through the Agricultural Department charges us with an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.853" offset="7694817">That's heard before a Hearing Examiner who is an employee of the Agricultural Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.119" offset="7723865">That's heard with two witnesses from the Agricultural Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.138" offset="7751973">That's heard with prosecutors, two of them from the Agricultural Department, and from that we had an appeal to a judicial review officer who also is an employee of the Agricultural Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.484" offset="7809337">And that was what we got in the way of a hearing until we got to the Eight Circuit Court of Appeals, and I would be the first to admit that they do have somewhat limited powers of review, but Congress never intended that the judiciary abrogate all of its powers to the regulatory commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.271" offset="7904423">Certainly, if it did, it should have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.607" offset="7925844">We have been told here that -- the reason that we did this, the reason we short-weighed was because if we short-weighed them when we weighed the cattle, then the buyer got more than he paid for and he was happy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.009" offset="8007450">I have heard that now for three-and-a-half years, but that isn't the truth either, and I don't mean to imply that anyone is fibbing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.431" offset="8041096">I mean to say that's a matter of philosophy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.689" offset="8058128">The truth about the matter is, in the conduct of livestock commission agents, whoever has got the cattle to sell, the buyers will come.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.270" offset="8100446">You don't need to worry about getting buyers if you can get the farmer to bring you the cattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.018" offset="8123434">We don't have to underweigh the farmer’s cattle and give armor a little excess, 10 or 15 pounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="2150.067" offset="8703666">We didn't place into the law the requirement that these orders be uniform.</text>

            <text syncTime="2164.075" offset="8759672">The Secretary of Agriculture himself said that the findings of the Department of Agriculture should be uniform, because otherwise they would be discriminatory.</text>
