            <label>Mr. Bart C. Durham III</label>
            <text syncTime="39.178" offset="260054">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.049" offset="275519">This case here is on a petition for writ of certiorari to the Sixth Circuit in which two questions are raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.740" offset="306343">The first one is, in respect to a case that was here before and affirmed four-four by this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.229" offset="340302">The second one is; the Stovall question as to whether or not this defendant had a fair pretrial confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.014" offset="379382">In order to give Your Honors a background, I'll state the chronology of the case, it was here in 1967 and ’68.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.577" offset="425671">The crime occurred in January of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.860" offset="442807">The defendant was identified at the police station in that year, and his subsequent trial and conviction was affirmed by the Tennessee Supreme Court in March of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.095" offset="499754">This Court granted certiorari, and the case was argued before this Court in January of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.995" offset="539355">Mr. Justice Marshall recused himself, and the Court after hearing plenary arguments, affirmed at the Tennessee Supreme Court which had affirmed the rape conviction by a vote of four-four.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.595" offset="597765">There was no written opinion from the Court, but Mr. Justice Douglas recorded the reasons for his dissent as one the four dissenters.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.285" offset="644472">Shortly after the case was affirmed in March of ’68, this defendant went right back into the Federal Court System by filing a petition for writ of habeas corpus, seeking to re-litigate what the state contends as -- was the same issue before the Federal District Judge in Nashville.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.390" offset="728900">A plenary – a limited evidentiary hearing was held, and the court found that the pretrial confrontation was violative of this Court’s principle in Stovall, and ordered a new trial unaffected by the valid identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.845" offset="802774">The state took in an appeal to the Sixth Circuit from the United States District Judge opinion, Honorable William E. Miller, who is now a member of the Sixth Circuit and, the Sixth Circuit by two to one division, Judges McRae, and Brook, and Edwards, in the majority with a lengthy dissent by (Inaudible) to Judge Brooks.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.130" offset="895875">That court affirmed the District Court from whence this Court has granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.953" offset="919176">So the two questions are; what is the effect of a four-four affirmance with respect to habeas corpus, and did the defendant have a prior pretrial identification?</text>
            <text syncTime="215.046" offset="963584">With respect to the first question, we think the law was quite clear and possibly conceded by, adversaries it says, that with respect to any other case except the habeas corpus case, a four-four affirmance ends the case, as between the parties, and as to that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.875" offset="1042892">Some distinction has been made by the Federal District Court, because this is not an ordinary civil case, it involves human liberties, and we think of the higher position in our jurisprudence which habeas corpus hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.878" offset="1110915">But, we say that historically and traditionally, there has to be an end to litigation, and that it should have ended this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.945" offset="1151143">But our primary contention with respect to this, is an act of Congress, 28 U.S.C. Title 2244 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="270.748" offset="1186356">That statute provides and that’s what we’re relying on here, it is found at page 3 of my brief, that that statute was drawn specifically to provide for finality of determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.137" offset="1259917">When a case has been to this Court and been -- a judgment of this Court, it says, “Shall be conclusive as to all issues which were before this court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="298.651" offset="1297951">And we cite the legislative history of that statute, as well as commentary in the Harvard Law Review and others, in which we feel it’s clear that Judge Oren Harris of the Tenth Circuit in his letter --</text>

            <text syncTime="536.056" offset="2247555">But we did feel, that what little there is, does support our position.</text>

            <text syncTime="563.126" offset="2355911">The -- ordinarily, I’m aware this Court wouldn’t want to go into the facts, where the District Court has found facts, and Appellate Court has affirmed it, and I’m asking Your Honors to look again at the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.547" offset="2409514">But the point is that the District Judge didn’t hear any new facts and he didn’t weigh the credibility of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.244" offset="2444309">We say that he made seven grievous sins.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.587" offset="2461759">We cite five of those at page 34 of our brief, and in addition of those five, earlier we mentioned the error that the District Judge made when he said that the victim changed her story, and between the time of the trial and the habeas corpus hearing, and that the police officer changed his story between the time of the trial in the habeas corpus hearing and that just isn’t simply so.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.544" offset="2565517">The fact of the matter is, the lineup was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.722" offset="2594252">There were only three people who testified about the lineup and I’m talking about the original trial record now.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.110" offset="2623822">Those policemen were Detective Smith, Lieutenant Daniel and Detective Bailey.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.033" offset="2643466">Detective Smith at page 40 of the record, and Detective Bailey at page 48 of the record, said that this victim identified the man before she heard him speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.726" offset="2694248">And that she thereafter asked him to speak merely to confirm her identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.232" offset="2720266">I say in this, and I make an analogy in my brief as one of the judges in the lower court did in Stovall, what would be the argument had that lady in Stovall case died, and they not taking the man over there to view Mrs. Barrett, the victim in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="701.742" offset="2910333">At the time this case was decided, no American Court that I’m aware of had ever held that the identification was anything other than a question of weight and not admissibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.109" offset="2951816">The weight even lower court cases were to come later.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.827" offset="2970728">This was in January -- August of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.268" offset="2988492">So the State believes that the record is un-contradicted, that the facts were that she identified them first, all the parties were black, the defendant was in the company of two black officers, she made -- the victim made this identification, then she requested that he speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.783" offset="3074487">Even the victim himself in his affidavit at the federal habeas hearing doesn't -- his affidavit we cite don't contradict it.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.645" offset="3109909">No, the third officer who testified about the lineup was the Supervising Officer, Lt. McDaniel.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.342" offset="3132792">And it’s unclear from his trial testimony, whether she identified him first or heard him speak first.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.592" offset="3161736">But at the habeas hearing, he -- his memory had been refreshed.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.806" offset="3178559">But we say, it wasn’t the point at the trial testimony, who cared?</text>
            <text syncTime="772.151" offset="3191933">Nobody asked on cross-examination, nobody brought it out, whether she heard him speak first or she didn’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.232" offset="3220250">And those are the five errors as I say, I’ve listed in the page, beginning at page 34 of my brief as just factual errors which the District Court, just made an error on.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.291" offset="3300498">In defense of the district judge, let me say that I’m the fifth or sixth attorney who’s handled this case for the state, and when the habeas petition was filed, the factual aspects were shuffled off in the second place, because the state felt that as a matter of law that we should have prevailed based on my first argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.679" offset="3398092">So these facts were never really strenuously argued to the District Court, but they are un-contradicted in this 1965 transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.790" offset="3438529">And we point out that by analogy to some of the other lineup or rather one on one confrontation cases which this Court has made that we believe this lineup is as far as is constitutionally impermissible than others.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.643" offset="3501955">I conclude.</text>

            <text syncTime="864.838" offset="3562768">It is far from accidental that with respect to the consequence of a four-four affirmance, the State relies on the statute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.961" offset="3615222">It goes -- its position of that a four-four affirmance would bar an initial federal habeas corpus petition claiming a denial of due process, fails to come to terms with several principles which have been quite prominent in this Court’s decisions in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.704" offset="3690141">The first is that a state court’s disposition of a state prisoner’s federal constitutional question is not a conclusive determination of that question, and that each state prisoner will at least have one opportunity to obtain a resolution of this federal constitutional claim in a federal forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.065" offset="3787630">When this Court affirms by an equal division, it merely leaves standing a state court determination of federal question, whatever it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.595" offset="3825768">Indeed one can imagine quite easily the Court affirming by an equal division to totally inconsistent lower court decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.069" offset="3875610">Yet, the position taken by the state here would convert this state court disposition of a federal constitutional question into an absolute bar that will be habeas corpus.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael Meltsner</label>
            <text syncTime="1143.049" offset="4675584">Well, I think using the label res judicata is somewhat misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.577" offset="4693661">Even in Sanders versus the United States, the Court said, “There were some principles of finality which govern the habeas corpus jurisdiction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.985" offset="4727306">But they were to be employed by use of equitable principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.605" offset="4741831">And Sanders sets forth situation where let's say, abuse of the writ is involved, where a federal district court can say, “No, I am not going to determine this question.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.122" offset="4783835">Of course, another court has heard and decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.549" offset="4793553">Now, whether it's called res judicata or stare decisis or a principle of finality, I don’t think there's a District Judge inland who would re-litigate a question which was fully considered by this Court ,and decided by this Court unless they were either a change in law or new factual -- material factual matter that was presented, which made the federal constitutional question a different one, in kind, from the one this Court decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.070" offset="4911626">Now, I do not believe that res judicata or any principle of finality would jurisdictionally bar a Federal District Court from considering a habeas petition in that circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.565" offset="4965648">But absent those circumstances, it’s plain to me that there would be no -- there would be no -- there will be no equity in the petition, and that it would not be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.616" offset="5005876">Now, it's interesting that the statute which the state here relies on heavily in light of the principle I mentioned, and also in light of the general principle that technical adjudication is used, short of the merits are not sufficient to bar federal habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.848" offset="5090722">The procedural rules emanating from the process of direct review do not bar federal habeas corpus, unless they amount to a deliberate bypass or an actual determination of federal question, the state comes to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.560" offset="5145579">Now there is nothing in the legislative history that suggests that Congress sought to deal with this problem, and it's this deal in my judgment that suggests the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1365.505" offset="5565419">Now Congress has passed in 2109 of the Judicial Code, a statute which expressly equates the lack of a forum by this Court with a four-four affirmance.</text>
