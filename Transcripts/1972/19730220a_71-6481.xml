            <text syncTime="34.860" offset="242813">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.693" offset="254098">Now, this case which is here on the petition for certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, presents the question whether petitioner who is a Negro may challenge the exclusion of Blacks from the federal grand jury which indicted him in a post conviction proceeding where the claim was not made before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.470" offset="333302">It deals with the scope of Section 2255, the equivalent of habeas corpus for federal prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.629" offset="361932">The facts are that petitioner, who is Black, was indicted for bank robbery in the Northern District of Mississippi in January, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.553" offset="401533">His court appointed counsel appeared with him for arraignment several weeks afterwards and was given 30 days for motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.796" offset="430582">On March 6, the motions were filed, including a motion to quash the indictment, but only on the ground that the arrest which led to his indictment was illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.725" offset="470288">That motion was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.456" offset="481155">The case went to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.377" offset="492857">The petitioner was convicted by the jury and sentenced to 14 years in jail.</text>

            <label>Mr. Melvin L. Wulf</label>
            <text syncTime="115.381" offset="564851">He was sentenced to 14 years and the conviction was affirmed on appeal by the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.537" offset="585540">And although it's not in the record, I do want to point out that Davis was released on parole last August after serving three years and eleven months of his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.501" offset="629426">In January 1971, Davis filed a motion under Section 2255 alleging that Negroes were systematically excluded from the grand jury which had handed down the indictment against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.043" offset="687522">And he specifically rested on the Fifth and Sixth Amendments and the relevant statutes in Title 28, which were then applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.332" offset="720750">He also alleged that his attorney in fact had made such a motion, but as appears from the opinions, both of the District Court and the Court of Appeals, that does not appear in the printed record, but I’ll return to that claim later on, it's not terribly important at this stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.817" offset="798595">At the same time that Davis --</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="175.336" offset="804760">Mr. Wulf, in as much as he professes to have made that objection, then I take it you must concede that he knew he had the right to object to the composition of the grand jury before trial?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="191.889" stopTime="310.595">
            <label>Mr. Melvin L. Wulf</label>
            <text syncTime="191.889" offset="870902">Well, all I would concede about his claim that he made it is that he didn’t intend to waive it, and it might also imply that he knew he had the right to make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.553" offset="901622">But what would have to be gone into at the hearing on remand, if there is a hearing on remand, would be, what reasons, if any, his lawyer did not raise that if Davis had in fact wanted him to raise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.125" offset="959822">But that is an issue that would really have to be canvassed and would go to the whole waiver problem, which is the central issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.661" offset="1002036">At the same time that he filed this 2255 motion, Davis also filed a motion for a discovery and inspection of facts relating to the claim of exclusion of Blacks from the jury selection system in the Northern District of California; both for the year 1968 and for the 20 years preceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.269" offset="1080404">The reply by the government was in effect a general denial which pointed out that he had not raised it before trial as extensively required by Rule 12 (b) (2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal procedure and also denied that any exclusion was practiced in the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.245" offset="1156368">The District Court, without granting Davis a hearing, dismissed, writing an opinion saying that his having failed to raise it prior to trial as required by 12 (b) (2) and adhering to Shotwell that he had waived the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.678" offset="1226062">He also concluded that in the language of the Rule, there was no cause shown to grant relief from the waiver and he had made this finding also without having granted any hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.849" offset="1282800">The case -- the decision of the District Court was affirmed by the Sixth Circuit in a very brief per curiam opinion, it too relied on Shotwell versus the United States and its construction of 12 (b) (2).</text>

            <text syncTime="331.962" offset="1431176">But the District Court searched the record, read the transcripts, said it couldn’t find any reference to that claim having been raised, and it is at this point a disputed claim, a fact, which the District Court, as I say, found on the basis of his own recollection and on the review of the transcript.</text>

            <text syncTime="468.719" offset="1978284">But whether or not it can be proved that his lawyer raised it, there has to be a hearing on the question of waiver, because that is always a factual question.</text>

            <text syncTime="498.265" offset="2096462">But he could either testify that he raised it, speaking of the lawyer, or that he couldn’t remember whether or not it had been raised or that he hadn’t raised it and then could himself testify about what kind of conversations, if any, if he had with Davis about the issue of jury exclusion, but these all require a hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1891.846" offset="7670784">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, the issue presented in this case is not as the petitioner alleges in his reply brief whether the right to grand jury indictment, whether this Court should assign the prohibition against racial discrimination in grand jury selection to the dustbin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.347" offset="7748733">The issue rather is whether that right should be vindicated in the orderly procedure promulgated by this Court in Rule 12 (b) (2) and adopted by Congress, and that procedure is simply that the motion which does not go to the fairness of the trial, which does not go to the admissibility of any evidence at the trial, which does not go to the defendant’s guilt or innocence, but to a defect in the pretrial proceedings which can easily be cured if timely raised, whether such emotion should be raised prior to trial or years later after trial and conviction, when retrial may be difficult or impossible in a federal habeas corpus proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.672" offset="7930023">Now, I’d like to talk about Rule 12 (b) (2) for a while rather than the habeas corpus statute, because Rule 12 (b) (2) is not simply a procedure for making a motion prior to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.996" offset="7979342">Rule 12 (b) (2) under the Enabling Act is the equivalent of a specific federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.128" offset="8007868">Under the terms of the Enabling Act, Rule 12 (b) (2) operates and in fact, to repeal any statute which is inconsistent with its provisions, and Rule 12 (b) (2) does not talk about knowing deliberate waivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.314" offset="8068577">It does not talk about waivers that are made only with consultations by the defendant’s lawyer, with his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.070" offset="8095640">Rule 12 (b) (2) says in plain terms that if you don’t make this motion, it shall be deemed waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.778" offset="8130435">This is really not a waiver in the general sense of the term, but really the equivalent of a statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.959" offset="8163244">Just as one's right to just compensation under the Fifth Amendment is not waived unless you have a knowing and deliberate waiver, that does not operate to make a statute of limitations which says you can only raise this claim for just compensation in three years or four years, unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.496" offset="8237328">Rule 12 (b) (2) has the same affect as an ordinary statute of limitations for the assertion of a particular constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.229" offset="8272332">And the policy considerations which motivated the adoption of Rule 12(b) are rather plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.572" offset="8305664">There really is no incentive for a lawyer representing a defendant to make this kind of a motion before trial, because what does he get?</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.719" offset="8342235">What would Mr. Davis’ lawyer would have gotten for him had he made this motion prior to trial and had he been successful?</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.774" offset="8370448">He would have gotten from Mr. Davis a new indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.751" offset="8382360">Mr. Davis would have stood trial, and by the way, it’s worth noting here that the defendant was caught in the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.880" offset="8406915">There isn’t a slightest question that any grand juror, Black or White, faithful to himself would have voted this indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.947" offset="8435127">So he would have gotten simply a new indictment, and that’s true with many defects in the institution of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.925" offset="8459055">They are easily cured if you make the motion when you're supposed to make them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.982" offset="8475251">On the other hand, there is a great incentive to sit back, say, why should I bother making this motion now, let me take my chances on an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.221" offset="8512240">And if he’s found guilty, well, then I can go ahead and make the motion after trial and that’s just another way of upsetting a valid judgment of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.751" offset="8550379">Now, the statute despite the fact of Rule 12 (b) (2) thus has a reasonable justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.730" offset="8582248">It is not an absolute waiver provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.800" offset="8590608">It has an expressed clause that gives the judge the right to grant relief from the provisions of the waiver, from the waiver clause upon a showing of just cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.166" offset="8631986">No showing of just cause was made here, and that both courts below so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.446" offset="8653197">There was not a slightest doubt that this defect about which the petitioner complains could have been made and discovered with due diligence at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.082" offset="8691649">And so that we have here a rule which is the equivalent of a federal statute and which takes precedence over anything to the contrary in the federal habeas corpus statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.970" offset="8735222">Having said that, let me say one more thing, that at the time Rule 12 (b) (2) was adopted, there was no conflict between Rule 12 (b) (2) and the federal habeas corpus statute in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.893" offset="8778898">It was well understood and it's settled law that if you didn’t comply with the procedural rule to raise an objection timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.679" offset="8810036">When you should have, you could not get federal habeas corpus relief, and as a matter, this Court so held in Daniels versus Allen decided in 1952 after the adoption of the federal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.867" offset="8858833">To the extent that there is now any inconsistency between the federal habeas corpus statute and the provisions of Rule 12 (b) (2), it’s resulted because of a thorough reexamination of the language of the federal habeas corpus statute undertaken in Fay versus Noia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.816" offset="8930617">No -- there is no similar basis for reinterpretation of Rule 12 (b) that the defendant asks for here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.033" offset="8967502">Rule 12 (b), both the language of Rule 12 (b), the advisory committee notes, the notes of the preliminary draftsmen all indicate, (a) that it was intended to apply here, and (b) that it was intended to apply regardless of whether or not there was knowing and deliberate waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.273" offset="9040436">Now, there are cases, state cases which are cited and Mr. Wulf has alluded to them in which the Fifth Circuit has granted habeas corpus relief to state prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.174" offset="9084113">Now, there are two things that I’d like to say about those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.110" offset="9099786">First, any state procedural rule which is the equivalent of Rule 12 (b) and which is inconsistent with the habeas corpus statute would under the Supremacy Clause have to yield to those provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.948" offset="9147120">As the Court noted in Fay versus Noia, state procedural rules must yield to the strong policy considerations which are reflected by the federal habeas corpus statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.114" offset="9187871">In this case, as far as this federal prisoner is concerned, the federal policy as stated by Rule 12 (b) (2), that was promulgated by this Court, that was adopted by Congress that it need not yield to the contrary under 18 U.S.C. 3771, it’s the habeas corpus statute which must yield.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.484" offset="9265298">In the second place, it wasn’t until last year in the case of which will be heard right after this one, that any Federal Court held that where the sole claim was to the grand jury and not the grand jury and the petit jury that this claim could be raised in a habeas corpus proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.777" offset="9346487">As a matter of fact, in Parker versus North Carolina reported at 397 U.S., decided long after Fay and after Kaufman, Mr. Justice White stated for the Court that the issue, whether the failure to comply with a procedural rule similar to Rule 12 (b) wasn’t -- could -- would stand as a bar to federal habeas corpus relief was still an open question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.727" offset="9442304">Now, there are many reasons why that should stand as an open question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2472.940" offset="9995160">All of the cases that this Court has dealt with involved claims with respect to the fairness of the trial, for the admissibility of the evidence, and to claims which go ultimately to whether the person should be found guilty or not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.948" offset="10063182">The claim with respect to a grand jury stands on a much, much different level.</text>

            <text syncTime="2498.075" offset="10095679">It involves simply the issue of whether this man should be indicted on the basis of a particular set of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.870" offset="10126817">While the right to a grand jury of course is a significant important right, this Court has recognized the distinction on several occasions, that is the distinction between the petit jury and the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.531" offset="10173524">In the first place, it is refused to hold that the right to a grand jury is so fundamental that the states must provide it under the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.921" offset="10211035">In Costello versus the United States, the issue was whether a defendant could obtain a review of the grand jury minutes to determine whether there was any evidence, any legally sufficient evidence at all to sustain the indictment, and this Court, in an unanimous opinions said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.397" offset="10276968">And Mr. Justice Black writing for the Court said, that in a trial on the merits, defendants are entitled to a strict observance of all the rules designed to bring about a fair verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.633" offset="10321899">Defendants are not entitled however to a rule which would result in interminable delay but add nothing to the assurance of a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.802" offset="10358575">Now, the right to a grand jury does not have anything to do with the right to a fair trial, and to permit it to be asserted years after a judgment of conviction, when retrial may be difficult or impossible, would have an undesirable effect on the entire criminal justice system as it's come to be recognized that the notion that there must come a time when judgments of conviction become final, when they are no longer subject, when issues which have nothing to do with guilt or innocence or with the fairness of the trial cannot be rehashed over and over again in a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.865" offset="10502875">And we submit that in this case the courts properly ruled that the claim was barred by Rule 12 (b) (2) and they properly denied habeas corpus relief.</text>
