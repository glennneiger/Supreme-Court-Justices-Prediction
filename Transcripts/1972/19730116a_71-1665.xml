            <text syncTime="14.355" offset="160789">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.570" offset="181687">This is a federal estate tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.871" offset="202898">This is here on a writ of certiorari to review a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.488" offset="241351">It involves one of those narrow but recurring questions which have no place to come for final decision except here and which arrive here only after long continued litigation and multiple decisions in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.928" offset="315120">The question relates to the value to be assigned to mutual fund shares held by the estate of a decedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.092" offset="355767">Specifically, it involves the validity of Section 20.1031-8 (b) of the Treasury Regulations on Estate Tax which is printed at pages 25 and 26 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.244" offset="436328">Beginning at the bottom of page 25 it provides, “The fair market value of a share in an open-end investment company (commonly known as a mutual fund) is the public offering price of a share.”</text>
            <text syncTime="104.668" offset="522010">Then there is a final clause which is not relevant, “adjusted for any reduction in price available to the public in acquiring the number of shares being valued.”</text>
            <text syncTime="116.495" offset="569344">But the significant part is that the regulation provides that, “The fair market value of a share in an open-end investment company is the public offering price of a share.”</text>

            <text syncTime="137.637" offset="653876">Prior to the issuance of that regulation, there was confusion and uncertainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.555" offset="677595">There was no clear rule or practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.310" offset="692642">The Treasury repeatedly endeavored to use the public offering price.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.638" offset="725974">Very frequently, the matter was settled out as one of the numerous things which came up in the final adjustment with the revenue agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.418" offset="761083">When suits were brought, the Department of Justice would not defend the public offering price as the value in the state of the law where there was no regulation and no officially stated rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.267" offset="840391">And I dare I say that that is one of the reasons why this regulation upon which we rely here, which was issued on October 10, 1963 by final approval by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, and Publication in the Federal Register as a Treasury decision while it provides at the bottom of page 26 in our brief, the provisions of this paragraph shall apply with respect to estates of decedents dying after October 10, 1963.</text>

            <text syncTime="233.269" offset="1036413">It is the price which is stated in a prospectus.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.418" offset="1056998">Usually, there is a close arrangement between the distributor and the investment company itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.376" offset="1084897">The investment company receives the net asset value.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.340" offset="1100779">The distributor receives the addition which in this case is usually about 8% often referred to as the load.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.212" offset="1140172">And a way to look at it and one to which I shall return is that the public offering price is the retail price at which the shares are sold to the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="290.884" offset="1266918">But the industry has a built-in resale price maintenance provision in the law from the beginning Section 22 of the Investment Company Act provides that no principal underwriter of such security and no dealer which means anybody who is a dealer shall sell any such security to any person except the dealer, a principal underwriter or the issuer except at a current public offering price described in the prospectus.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="393.685" offset="1678085">There would be a substantial amount involved in a big block and a person who had a large block would be reluctant to have them redeemed at the net asset value if he could find some other way to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.511" offset="1733465">Apparently, it is still very difficult to sell them by a private individual at anything approaching the public offering price.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.124" offset="1795845">In this case, the decedent died on December 4, 1964, somewhat more than a year after the new regulation was put out so that the regulation was applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.102" offset="1843806">Her executor valued the shares on her estate tax return at the redemption price, the bid price, or net asset value.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.260" offset="1880377">The Commissioner determined in accordance with the regulations that the share should be valued at their public offering price and he determined that a deficiency accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.198" offset="1928129">That difference is the load usually about 8% in an open-end investment trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.061" offset="1963656">The executor paid the additional tax, filed a claim for refund, filed suit to recover the tax contending that the regulation is invalid, and the District Court agreed and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.169" offset="2028022">The regulation has similarly been held invalid in the Ninth Circuit in Davis against the United States with one dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.369" offset="2068877">That case involved $600 and we did not seek to bring it here because the question is here in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.200" offset="2100224">On the other hand, the regulation has been upheld in the Sixth Circuit in Ruehlmann against the Commissioner which affirmed a divided decision of the Tax Court of United States and this Court denied certiorari several years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.308" offset="2168560">And the companion gift tax regulation has been held valid by the Seventh Circuit in Halliwell against the United States, and similarly there’s been some division in the decisions of the District Courts and the question is now pending before the Tenth Circuit and the Court of Claims.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="559.806" offset="2342640">It is my position Mr. Justice that in determining the value of a gift of a mutual fund share to a charity that under the analogy to the regulation because the regulation applies directly to estate tax and to gift tax that the amount of the deduction is the public offering price exactly the same figure for which we contend here.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.497" offset="2453400">I believe our opponents say that there is no evidence that that is actually applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.967" offset="2487254">I cannot cite clear authorities but it is our position that that is the valuation which should be applied in determining the amount of a gift tax deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.011" offset="2543365">Now at first flash, it may seem that the regulation goes a little far.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.736" offset="2566353">It’s contended vigorously that the most that the estate can realize from the shares is the bid price or what might be called a liquidating value.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.743" offset="2610343">But further consideration, I think shows that that argument is by no means conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.268" offset="2636466">A property is not ordinarily valued in estates at what can be realized from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.266" offset="2664469">For example, if the decedent owned Blackacre at an agreed valued of a $100,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.933" offset="2695084">His estate could not ordinarily realize a $100,000 from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.922" offset="2715042">It would be likely to have to pay a commission on sale of say $6,000 or 6%.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.131" offset="2743881">Yet the value of Blackacre for estate tax purposes would undoubtedly be a $100,000 and not the $94,000 that could be realized net on its sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.995" offset="2795395">And that I think on further reflection is right, if they continue the whole Blackacre, don’t sell it, it’s worth a $100,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.423" offset="2829040">On the other hand, if they sell back Blackacre, and have to pay a $6,000 commission on sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.827" offset="2850670">That commission is deductible and only the net amount would be subject to estate tax.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="695.036" offset="2883480">The difference however in them is that in the one case it’s a seller’s commission, in the other case, it’s a buyer’s commission.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="703.452" offset="2917230">Yes, Mr. Justice but I don’t think that really makes any difference because I think that’s really the difference between a sale on the market and a retail sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.397" offset="2964982">When you sell real estate, you sell it on a market, and similarly, with respect to ordinary stocks and bonds held by a decedent’s estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.491" offset="3005315">The value for estate tax purposes would not be reduced by a commission on sale even though such a commission would reduce the amount which could actually be realized on the sale of the shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.348" offset="3060799">Now, in this case, the load becomes a part of the retail price just as the retailers’ markup in a drugstore or a grocery store becomes a part of the retail price including a portion of the markup which he devotes to a commission to his sales people, and yet the retail price would be the fair market value of the property and would include the sales commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="785.022" offset="3243447">It is true if you can find a buyer who will pay you the full price.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.405" offset="3264972">Experience and the record show that that is a rare occurrence or it does sometimes occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.262" offset="3296423">The problem of disposing off the shares, suppose you do dispose off them at the net asset value then you can deduct the amount of the difference between the public offering price and the net asset value as in administration expense, if you sell them in connection with the administration of the estate, so that you would only be taxed if you actually do sell them on the net figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.448" offset="3413138">On the other hand, if you don’t sell them, you have got something which costs the full amount in the only place where you can legally buy them and practically buy them.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.761" offset="3486386">The offering price is in fact the price at which large numbers of these shares change hand everyday from willing sellers to willing buyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.213" offset="3544273">Thus, the record in this case includes Exhibit 11 offered by the taxpayer which shows the numbers of shares sold for a number of different fiscal years for each one of these three funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.801" offset="3638627">Exhibit 11 shows that in the fiscal year ended October 31st, 1965 which is the year in which the decedent died; Investors Stock Funds sold 15,213,000 shares which works out to about $60,000 per day -- about 60,000 shares per day.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.311" offset="3736639">Investors Mutual sold 34, 499,000 shares in the year-ended September 30th, 1965, that works out to about a 138,000 shares per day which shows that there were a very large number of willing buyers who were willing to pay the net offering price at retail to sellers who were ready, willing, and available to sell the shares at the public offering price.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.674" offset="3874043">Now, the third fund, Investors Selective Fund was considerably smaller.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.049" offset="3895568">It sold 1,500,000 shares during the applicable fiscal year but even that would work out to 6,000 shares per day which passed from willing sellers to willing buyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.390" offset="3964949">Now, this is very persuasive evidence it seems to me that the offering price is in fact the price at which these shares really transfer from a willing seller to willing buyer or at least that the regulation which provides that they should be valued on this basis prospectively applied is a proper one for the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to make and should be sustained by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1013.859" offset="4158777">Perhaps, this is as good a point as any to bring in this Court’s decision in Guggenheim against Rasquin which involved a gift, a gift of a paid up life insurance policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.675" offset="4226069">And the contention was there made on behalf of the taxpayer that the gift should be valued at the surrender value of the life insurance policy which is the only amount which the donee could obtain either from the insurance company or from a bank if it wanted to borrow on the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.827" offset="4326693">And this Court held in Guggenheim against Rasquin that the proper value for gift tax purposes was the cost of that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.578" offset="4373713">This was the price which would have to be paid in order to obtain such a policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.243" offset="4404328">This is in effect not the liquidating value which the surrender value would be but the retail price of the policy, and it used as analogy a gift by a man to his wife of a new automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.627" offset="4489906">Let’s say that the automobile was a Cadillac which costs $65,000 for he paid $65,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.395" offset="4532955">He drove it to the house in order to deliver it to his wife as a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.140" offset="4559914">By that time, it was a used car and it could be turned into a dealer only for a sum considerably less than $65,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.297" offset="4596590">But the regulations have always provided that the value in such a case is the retail price, the price which would have to be paid for such an item.</text>

            <text syncTime="1212.426" offset="4953109">Nevertheless, to me, the really controlling factor in determining whether the regulation made by the Treasury can be sustained or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1232.355" offset="5032835">And the fact is that very large numbers of these shares are transferred everyday between willing sellers and willing buyers at the net asset price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.418" offset="5085080">Now, it is said in the Guggenheim case that, oh, well the insurance policy had a lot of value above and beyond the surrender value and it’s proper to take that into account in determining the value of the insurance policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.264" offset="5148400">But same thing is equally applicable here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1966.690" offset="7970147">The counsel for the Government has argued on the premise that the sole issue to be decided here is the validity of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.614" offset="8001808">A mere rebuttal of this would be apt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.496" offset="8013406">I’m sure to only lead the Court with a rather narrow and somewhat blurred vision on what this case is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.647" offset="8049977">The real issues are factual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.222" offset="8060217">Were the shares owned by Mr. Bennett at the time of her death worth a $124,000?</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.442" offset="8085191">That being the amount she could have sold them for, or where they worth a $133,000?</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.937" offset="8115075">That being the amount the executor would have had to pay a broker to purchase as many additional sales as she already owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.810" offset="8146631">And thirdly, was the $9,000 difference, that being the amount going to the broker, an asset of Mrs. Bennett’s estate?</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.313" offset="8184665">It seems to me that the regulation must stand or follow and the answers to those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.017" offset="8207444">Then there’s also the constitutional question if the Commissioner may by regulation deprive taxpayers of due process of law by fixing a value, an arbitrate value that precludes the consideration of any other relevant facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.815" offset="8286647">I hope in a matter of 10 or 12 minutes to give the Court, the benefit I hope of a more broader perspective of the mutual fund issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.884" offset="8326875">It was in 1962, that I first became involved in the mutual fund issue, first on behalf of a town police officer, and then on the estate of my high school homeroom teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.433" offset="8377135">Other cases came along quickly because beginning in 61 and 62, revenue agents were raising the same issue in every estate on mutual fund shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.447" offset="8417155">We soon discovered that it was useless to argue with revenue agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.639" offset="8433977">They -- even though they privately agreed with us, they said their orders had come from Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.770" offset="8458428">There was no one to appeal to inside the Treasury Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.902" offset="8486954">So what we did was to pay and sue for refunds in the District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.414" offset="8505031">We didn’t have to try those cases because as the counsel for the Government agrees, the Department of Justice agreed with us and ordered -- or instructed the IRS to refund our money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.743" offset="8558320">But this was all prior to Act 1211 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.876" offset="8574830">There really wasn’t much of an issue to be tried on those days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.333" offset="8588727">There was no doubt then as there’s no doubt today about the value of a mutual funds here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2940.021" offset="11863437">I think, then the Government puts great emphasis I think on the duty of the Court to defer to the judgment of the Court defer to the judgment of the commissioner in choosing between so-called reasonable alternatives citing United States versus Correll and Bingler versus Johnson.</text>

            <text syncTime="3121.497" offset="12589328">Our position is that the Commissioner in promulgating this regulation was completely unrealistic and arbitrary and unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.369" offset="12628825">By arbitrarily assigning of value of here to these years which the estate could never get under any circumstances at a price that precludes consideration of any other relevant facts which is required by his own regulations.</text>
