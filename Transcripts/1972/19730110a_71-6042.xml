            <text syncTime="61.982" offset="351274">Pursuant to the requirements of this statute, the defendant not less than five days prior to trial must file a written intent of notice to rely on alibi evidence.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Marvin Kuhn</label>
            <text syncTime="207.429" offset="933073">Yes, Your Honor, the Court of Appeals held that they would not reach this issue because the State did not offer any rebuttal evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.389" offset="972884">However, the petition does appeal like that is valid in this case because the State was not required to offer any rebuttal evidence because the defendant’s alibi testimony was stricken from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.962" offset="1023248">So there would be no reason for the State to offer rebuttal evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.090" offset="1043728">That was the reason given by the Oregon Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.654" offset="1069955">Now, petitioner also believes that the statute denies due process and that it prevents the defendant from testifying in his own behalf if he fails to give notice as required by the Oregon statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.993" offset="1119378">Also that denies him his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself because of the written notice required as the condition precedent to his taking the stand and giving alibi testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.335" offset="1160756">And that it denies him his right to the Sixth Amendment to rights of compulsory process.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.167" offset="1188028">Now, this Court in Williams versus Florida did uphold the alibi statute from the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.872" offset="1214882">However, one of the main bases as petitioner reach the case once that Florida did provide for a liberal reciprocity in their statute that the Oregon statute does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.106" offset="1259813">Under the terms of the Florida statute, both the defendant and the State are required to submit the names of their proposed alibi witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.137" offset="1303907">The defendant for his alibi, the State for any prospective rebuttal witnesses they may wish to call.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.778" offset="1334523">If either party under the Florida statute failed to give the required notice, that party including the State would not be allowed to call their alibi witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.123" offset="1375901">The Florida statute was therefore equal in placing the duty, responsibility as well as the sanction equally among the parties for failure to comply with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.540" offset="1425533">The Oregon statute places the entire obligation on the part of the defendant that requires nothing on the part of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.885" offset="1458866">The State has no duty to disclose any rebuttal witnesses nor as there any sanction applied against the State for failure to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="379.775" offset="1622497">It is cited in the State’s supplemental brief State versus Kelsaw.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.294" offset="1644544">In that case, the Oregon Court of Appeals has recently held that a defendant does not have to require with the Oregon alibi statute now, unless and until the State supply him with the specific time and place that the crime was alleged to have been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.540" offset="1733569">If the State fails to do this either by way of indictment or information relayed to the defendant’s attorney by the District Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.533" offset="1761468">The defendant does not have to comply with the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1290.339" offset="5264697">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.786" offset="5278490">Questions have arisen this morning with respect to Oregon procedure and I should like for a moment if I may to attempt to clarify little further for Justice Brennan, the present status of Oregon law with respect to discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.661" offset="5330004">First of all, there is no general discovery statute in Oregon with respect to the right to criminal defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.501" offset="5353409">And included in that, there is no right to a bill of particulars as the law now stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.400" offset="5372949">I believe that after the legislatures concluded its work at the present time there will be one but there is not at the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.608" offset="5397817">The Kelsaw case represents really the first major step by any Oregon Court of Appeals whether the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals to establish any right of discovery on the part of the criminal defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.854" offset="5442748">In that case only goes as far as it does I believe because that’s all it was called to do in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.949" offset="5467199">Now, it establishes the right of a defendant to refuse to comply with the alibi statute unless that the defendant is in possession at the time the compliance is called for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.811" offset="5506591">It is in the possession of information supplied by the state which tells him the time, the date in which the crime was alleged to have occurred and a place where it is alleged to have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.905" offset="5547029">And this ruling is made on the basis of a theory of fundamental fairness to the effect that the defendant cannot be held responsible for disclosing that he was at place “X” until he knows that he’s charged of having been at place “Y.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.529" offset="5597497">Now, the Court of Appeals went no further because there was no need in the Kelsaw case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1380.436" offset="5625083">But I would submit to the Court that in an appropriate case where the defendant applied at the time he gave the notice applied for in order from the Court requiring the State to disclose to the defendant the names of any witnesses it propose to call and rebuttal to his alibi testimony their names and addresses and so on that he would be granted that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.617" offset="5705853">And I think that would be called for on a basis of this Court’s decision in Williams versus Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.281" offset="5724453">The point is the Oregon courts have not yet had a chance to deal with this question and when they are given the chance to deal with this question, I believe they’ll deal with it in the same way they dealt with the Kelsaw problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.958" offset="5767189">They’ll analyze it, they’ll take this Court’s decision in Williams and they’ll apply it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2144.902" offset="8682977">What occurred was -- this trial happen about two or three months after this Court’s decision Williams versus Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.869" offset="8710875">And it’s -- I think it’s evident from the transcript if you examine it in the appendix that the Trial Court was aware neither of the alibi statute nor this Court’s decision in Williams so that both of those things came as a surprise to the trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.795" offset="8762598">On the other hand, the defendant was aware both of them because as the transcript shows the defense counsel gave a copy of the Williams decision to the prosecutor during the noon recess.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.139" offset="8799901">And he came in the afternoon and put on the proceeded put on his alibi testimony which was well the only testimony offered by the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.416" offset="8829053">And the first time, the Court was aware that there was an alibi statute or there was a problem with an alibi statute was when the prosecution entered in objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.130" offset="8863848">So, what occurred after that is not particularly clear the defendant was given an opportunity to make it showing of good cause where the requirements of statute should not be waive -- should be waive?</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.488" offset="8913272">And his offering was to the effect that first he thought that the date on the indictment was wrong and he was prepared after alibi witnesses on a different date.</text>
