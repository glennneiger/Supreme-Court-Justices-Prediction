            <text syncTime="39.113" offset="259845">This case does not involve a question of the perfection of the Federal Work Incentive Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.504" offset="285341">In 1967, Congress enacted for the first time a compulsory work program for all AFDC recipients which it required each of the states to include in its plan of aid to families with dependent children.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.103" offset="339780">When it enacted that program, it described the program in the introductory statutory material as being designed to cultivate in individuals the sense of dignity, self-worth and confidence that flows from being a wage earning member of society.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.608" offset="401847">In 1971, the State of New York elected to enact its own compulsory work program applicable also to AFDC recipients which established the presumption of employability for such recipients and which was designed to and to a certain extent did achieve maximum welfare role reductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.223" offset="480214">One administrator in the State of New York characterized the results under the program as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.371" offset="504874">“Last month, the weekend of October 5, we closed a hundred cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.787" offset="522533">I haven’t really gotten to closing codes for all of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.809" offset="534653">I would think that the employment section is having a greater impact on the right of closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.425" offset="553044">We are closing a very great proportion of cases on the basis of failure to comply on the employment procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.724" offset="578226">That seems to be reflective of a somewhat different purpose than the purpose which Congress had in mind when it enacted the statute designed to cultivate a sense of dignity, self-worth and confidence.”</text>

            <text syncTime="355.434" offset="1525112">I think HEW does suggest in its manual that the most appropriate method for delivering checks to individuals is through the mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.143" offset="1567953">I think that the requirement as it was enacted in the State of New York was really one related to those employability requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.043" offset="1599509">Interestingly, you know, the State of New York did have a residence requirement which they enacted at the same time which was held to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.782" offset="1630542">And that particular requirement presumably would’ve been in the place in which the state would’ve enacted a requirement that was specifically addressed to the problem of dual residency.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.005" offset="1675368">That was enacted at the same time as a work program.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.375" offset="1688848">Four District Courts and one Circuit Court of Appeals have reached the conclusion that the Compulsory Work Program established by Congress has precluded the states from enacting similar Compulsory Work Programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.219" offset="1736286">Those decisions for a right on three separate grounds in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.081" offset="1759692">First of all, they were right because the Federal Government has preempted the state activity in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.870" offset="1782888">Secondly, the decisions were right because the work rules constituted additional conditions of ineligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.830" offset="1810683">Thirdly, they were right as applied to this particular case because the New York statute is in conflict with the federal statute at so many points.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.901" offset="1846941">In 1935, Congress enacted the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.332" offset="1864704">The President’s message which conveyed that Act to the Congress included within it a suggestion of a program for aid to widowed and otherwise, separated mothers.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.243" offset="1904306">That program according to the message was “designed to release from the wage earning role the person whose natural function is to give her children the physical and mental guardianship necessary.”</text>
            <text syncTime="464.858" offset="1962820">In other words, the program was designed to be for people whom Congress had made a judgment should not be employed outside the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.974" offset="1995316">Secondly, in 1961, Congress amended the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.398" offset="2016946">For the first time, it included in the coverage of the Act, children in homes in which a breadwinner was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.482" offset="2049337">As part of that Act and for the first time, Congress imposed a requirement that the breadwinner accept jobs to which he would be referred and report to the State Employment Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.958" offset="2095208">That is the first time that we find a requirement of compulsory work in the Federal AFDC program.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.657" offset="2121958">In 1962, Congress then enacted a com – a different compulsory program known as the Community Work and Training Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.044" offset="2159574">The legislative history of that program is set out in the brief submitted by the National Welfare Rights Organization as amicus curiae indicates that that program was still to be primarily for those fathers who were in the AFDCU program, the breadwinners.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.041" offset="2223522">However, and most importantly, when working -- when work incentive program was enacted in 1967, both of those programs were repealed and replaced by requirements that states have work incentive programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.231" offset="2276289">The Community Work and Training Program was completely repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.674" offset="2290082">The requirement in the AFDCU program that fathers accept work to which they were referred was repealed and replaced by a requirement that the state’s put all such fathers in the work incentive program within 30 days of their eligibility for AFDCU benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.646" offset="2361971">What the work incentive program did was it identified those individuals who in the judgment of Congress were appropriate for compulsory work or training.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.345" offset="2400737">It also identified those individuals by -- those individuals who were inappropriate for compulsory work or training.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.078" offset="2435636">Thirdly, it established an elaborate program of job placement and training for appropriate individuals and volunteers.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.953" offset="2475133">Fourthly and very importantly, it established -- it authorized the establishment of a separate administrative agency which would handle the work incentive program.</text>

            <text syncTime="913.098" offset="3755760">I think that raises an interesting point too in connection with the state’s suggestion here that there is a preference for a WIN -- referral for the individuals under the New York State program.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.831" offset="3802676">That kind of a preference is really irrelevant if one examines the way the federal statute operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.268" offset="3824410">If you're exempt from the program, from the work incentive program, what good does it do that person referred under the state program to be referred to WIN?</text>
            <text syncTime="937.423" offset="3853040">That person will be told that they can’t participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.048" offset="3863594">If you're not exempt from the program, you're supposed to be registered for WIN, registered for a WIN, not registered for something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.324" offset="3892642">Those individuals are yanked out of WIN and placed in the -- whatever facility, whatever service the state has available which could include admittedly employment, but are kept from receiving the benefits of the federal program as well, I might add is the job placement requirements of the federal program.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.526" offset="3989504">That too I think gets to an interesting point which is that under the federal program, work referrals are not supposed to occur if those work referrals would interfere with the plan for the permanent rehabilitation or self-support of the individual welfare recipient.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.770" offset="4058467">Now that seems a perfectly logical rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.007" offset="4067349">I think that some of the result -- that is not a requirement of the jobs that the difference in the standards of the jobs to which people are to be referred under the state program as compared with the work incentive program and one of the results of this is you get situations such as people being taken out of college and told to go to work as go-go dancers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.034" offset="4147493">One other important aspect of the 1971 Amendments should be mentioned and that is that those amendments also enacted as a matter of statutory law, certain priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.200" offset="4196185">Unemployed fathers and volunteer mothers were to be compelled to take part in the -- the unemployed fathers were to be compelled and the volunteer mothers were to be provided with the services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.093" offset="4239757">Before those services or jobs were provided to other individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.633" offset="4261909">There are no such priorities in the New York State Program and the consequence of that is, is really a virtual repeal of that aspect of the federal law which establishes these priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.912" offset="4302973">Congress has made up -- has set up a specific set of things that it wants this people to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.006" offset="4323349">It has established an order in which those things are to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.231" offset="4340276">The state ignores that order and refers people directly to its own program in whatever order is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.405" offset="4384998">After a person has been registered for the work incentive program, a process of appraisal begins under the rules that had been adopted by HEW.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.839" offset="4422719">The statute itself requires that before a person can be placed in work or training, the Department of Social Services must provide a number of services, counseling, health, vocation, rehabilitation, child care and other services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.318" offset="4480606">The Federal Government picks up 90% of the costs of these services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.667" offset="4494085">Those services are designed to prepare the person for certification as ready for work or training.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.379" offset="4516864">I think an examination of the budgetary history of the work incentive program is useful if one is to see what the purposes of those services really are and how important they have been in the federal program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.047" offset="4571512">In the Fiscal Year ending, 1969, Congress appropriated $117,500,000.00 for the work incentive program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.190" offset="4604113">In the Fiscal Year ending 1972, that is the last year of the operation of the program before the 1971 Amendments, Congress appropriated $259,160,000.00 for the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.255" offset="4660433">In the proposed budget, admittedly an austerity budget for Fiscal Year 1974, the President has proposed $534,434,000.00 for the work incentive program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.819" offset="4710693">Of that, $40 million dollars is to go for the process of registration, this appraisal process that we were discussing, enrollment, follow up services, public service employment, $49 million, On-the-job training, $46 million, institutional training, $151,351,000.00, other services, $116,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.460" offset="4813197">These services are real.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.541" offset="4817586">I mean, they're provided, Congress wants them to be provided to work incentive program participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.564" offset="4837648">But it's not just services that are provided, it’s also jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.160" offset="4851963">Congress did not leave the question of jobs to the operation of the marketplace, the way the New York state program does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.057" offset="4875577">Congress specifically appropriated money under Section 6 -- specifically authorized the use of appropriated money under Section 633 (d) of the Act for job placement services and for job development services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.299" offset="4928554">The on the job training money and the public service employment money that I just described is money that is used to subsidize employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.660" offset="4961991">In addition, at the same time of the 1971 Amendments came into effect, Congress amended the Internal Revenue Code to provide a tax incentive for employers to employ WIN graduates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.627" offset="5009847">In other words, Congress made it very clear that they did not intend this to be just a program of social services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.018" offset="5031476">It was a program that was designed to lead in an orderly fashion from a process of registration of the non exempt through a program of providing services, child care, counseling, training, and eventually into a permanent job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.760" offset="5098454">The New York program interferes with that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.754" offset="5162402">Under the New York program, a presumption of employability was established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.090" offset="5187688">In other words, it was assumed that a welfare recipient was employable unless that person could demonstrate that he or she was not properly in the work program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.407" offset="5237008">Those individuals who were found to be employable were required as we’ve mentioned before to report to the State Employment Service to obtain a Certificate that no Job is available from the State of Employment Service and could be terminated for failure to report to the State Employment Service, failure to report the results of a job interview or failures to report to a job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.766" offset="5322480">Notice that there is a real difference here between the federal statute and the state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.775" offset="5338467">Under the federal statute, the presumption is that one must register for the services designed to prepare one for work or training.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.992" offset="5367306">Under the federal -- under the state statute, the presumption is one of employability.</text>

            <text syncTime="1326.379" offset="5408893">This means that under the state program, you leap from the first step, non-exemption, not being exempt from the program, all the way up to the last step, job placement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.136" offset="5455914">One would not expect the program such as that to result in much successful permanent employment and in fact the New York Program didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.503" offset="5489351">More than half of the persons referred under the New York Work Program were separated from the jobs in which they have been placed at the end of four weeks after placement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.436" offset="5537102">Similarly, I think that it’s interesting to compare the statistics on the numbers of individuals who are actually placed with those who were terminated for -- not terminated because they had received income, but terminated because they had found to be -- to have -- they were found to have failed to comply with the requirements of the state program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.270" offset="5624456">2000 -- in July 1971, there were 2,361 job placements under the New York Program.</text>

            <text syncTime="1554.036" offset="6319522">If you refuse to take part in the work incentive program under federal law, you're supposed to be terminated from benefits only if and so long as you do not comply.</text>

            <text syncTime="2077.130" offset="8411930">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.601" offset="8425827">Briefly, I would like to cover in rebuttal three points of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.353" offset="8456756">One, the issue of preemption is one of Congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.882" offset="8482879">I call Your Honors attention to the quotes at page 7-A of our reply brief in which we quote from the Chairman of the Appropriate Congressional Committees who stated that it was not their intent even in enacting the WIN program to prohibit the states from providing for complimentary work programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.292" offset="8568560">I think in the WIN statutes and in the 1971 Amendments themselves, there are some indications of a lack of such an intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.599" offset="8601788">First of all, with the 15% penalty provision which provides for a penalty for states which fail to refer into the WIN program, 15% of their registrants for WIN leaves a balance of 85% of the WIN registrants whom Congress must have considered would not necessarily be processed through the WIN program and would seem to me that of those 85% could by the virtue of the statute be left out of any work requirement if the state itself wanted to enact such a requirement might raise serious constitutional problems for the 15% who were then -- who have been selected and required to go for employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.567" offset="8789661">Secondly that the -- system of priorities which were established for referrals in the 1971 Amendments, we submit to this Court involved a question of the Congressional determination of the use of, proper use of federal funds that the proper use of the federal funds should be in and under the WIN program to first place an employment those persons who were most job ready.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.799" offset="8898539">It does mean that this was if -- sole priorities for persons and who could be referred under what conditions they could be referred for employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.010" offset="8935424">And it seems to me that the simple establishment of priorities indicates the Congressional intent not to preempt the entire field to provide for work and -- work or training for all ADC recipients because if that -- if they were all inclusive, there would not have necessarily been a system of priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.556" offset="9001566">If you're going to include everybody, you don’t need to establish priorities for one various classes you’re going to be included.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.978" offset="9031241">I’d like to call the Court’s attention, the fact that and clarify possibly, the fact that the number of districts within the Social Services Districts within a state and the with -- which the WIN program operates is a determination solely of the United States Secretary of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.422" offset="9093099">And that in fact, as I referred to one of our briefs, the Secretary of Labor refused to request from the State of New York to increase the number of WIN districts within the state.</text>
