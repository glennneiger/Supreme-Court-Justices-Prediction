            <label>Mr. John G. Rocovich, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="39.672" offset="262040">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.636" offset="273951">The facts surrounding this case are both clear and undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.463" offset="289207">During the summer of 1969, a Field Revenue Agent commenced an investigation of the returns of the petitioner for the years 1964 through 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.890" offset="334973">Petitioner informed him that her records were temporarily in the possession of her accountant, whereupon the Field Agent proceeded to the accountant's office for the records and made available for his examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.437" offset="385128">Now the records in question were primarily canceled checks and working papers which were made by the petitioner in her own handwriting for purposes of keeping records for her sole proprietorship restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.296" offset="436537">The Field Agent examined the records for several days.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.160" offset="452002">During the course of his examination he apparently suspected that criminal fraud was involved and he requested and received the assignment of a Special Revenue Agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.852" offset="494738">The Trial Court found as matter of fact that the Special Agent in his capacity as such was conducting a joint investigation with the Field Revenue Agent for the purposes of ascertaining the correctness of the income tax return, plus the purpose of ascertaining whether there was any criminal tax fraud in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.531" offset="577494">The Special Agent, once he came to the case, proceeded to the accountant's offices, observed the petitioner's records, and thereupon went to the petitioner's house where he introduced himself, showed his credentials and gave a standard Miranda warning which included a statement that she did not have to produce any information and she was entitled to seek a lawyer's counsel before she responded to any questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.929" offset="671117">And the special agent proceeded to question the petitioner and then proceeded to the petitioner's accountant's office to seize or copy the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.183" offset="708106">In the meantime, petitioner heeded the special agent's advice and had contacted her accountant and lawyer, and advised the accountant to turn the records over to no one but her attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.589" offset="753768">When the special agent arrived at the accountant's office, the accountant refused to turnover the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.231" offset="780309">The special agent at that point issued a summons to the accountant directing him to turn the records over.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.359" offset="808835">From the special agent's return to the accountant's office on the return date, he discovered that the accountant had already turned the records over to me as the petitioner's attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.111" offset="855855">The government then instituted a proceeding to judicially enforce the summons under 7402(a) and 7604(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.214" offset="904234">This action arises from an order of the District Court for the Western District of Virginia affirmed by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals directing me to turnover the books and records in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.212" offset="956270">The central question we believe in this case is, whether or not the privileges against self-incrimination and unreasonable search and seizure prevents the government from seizing petitioner's personal books and records whenever they are out of her actual physical possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.032" offset="1027532">By way of background I think the government has never denied that the records in the hands of the accountant were the property of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.955" offset="1059192">In fact in their brief to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals they conceded that the records in question had they been in the hands of petitioner would have been protected by the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.109" offset="1107780">Thus the question becomes I think whether records created and owned by the petitioner somehow lose their privileged status when they are out of a actual physical possession.</text>

            <text syncTime="263.046" offset="1155532">Mr. Rocovich, does the record show whether these records were of a nature that the taxpayer would turn them over to her accountant say for a few days each year and then get them back or whether on the other hand they were more or less permanently in the custody of her accountant?</text>

            <text syncTime="280.271" offset="1224495">Well, I believe the accountant testified that the records had been delivered to him over a period of years, 55 on to for the purpose of preparing tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.426" offset="1273083">As a matter of fact, some records were at the petitioner's home and some records were at the accountant's office and she delivered the balance of the records to the accountant for the purpose of facilitating the sub-investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.467" offset="1325223">I don't think there is any evidence to the effect that the records were owned by the accountant.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.636" offset="1349883">In fact, the petitioner has always asserted through the proceedings below that they were clearly her records and owned by her and the government has conceded it.</text>

            <text syncTime="334.273" offset="1440475">The petitioner believes that the test of whether she may rely on the Fifth and Fourth Amendment privileges is whether she possesses substantial instance of ownership in the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.254" offset="1488436">And we submit that this test of course, would be subject to the condition at where a taxpayer voluntarily and knowingly and intentionally published the records then they would lose this privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.750" offset="1538382">In essence, I believe the test is from what source did the records originate.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.353" offset="1560743">If they originated with the petitioner, they should be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.360" offset="1572864">If they did not then they should not.</text>

            <text syncTime="378.951" offset="1619153">The cases which we cite in our brief are a series of cases which state that possession is not the test, it is ownership and as long as the petitioner had the right to demand or the taxpayer had the right to demand the records back, that possession was not the key as to whether or not they were privileged.</text>

            <text syncTime="462.217" offset="1952266">He had been doing this for 20 years or so.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.764" offset="1966477">I think the importance -- so we believe that the ruling question that we submit is the really only practical and workable rule which this Court that can adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.884" offset="2010885">If that is not the rule and if the government's test is adopted, I think the alternatives aren't satisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.574" offset="2045680">We could return to the case of Burdeau v. McDowell by this Court, I think in 1921, where records were turned over to prosecutor which had been obtained by a party breaking into a man's office, blasting the safe up with a part of dynamite, smashing his desk on axe and turning the records over to prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.119" offset="2123839">Certainly that type of evidence should not be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.163" offset="2144005">They introduced in the evidence that we agree with the dissent of Justice's Holmes and Brandeis and they said, “What could be more shocking to our sense of decency and fair play than that?”</text>
            <text syncTime="521.823" offset="2190712">Actually the Court's decision did not go off on the point of possession or ownership, they merely said, this Court merely said, “Well it was obtained by government compulsion so it must be okay.”</text>
            <text syncTime="533.783" offset="2238464">But I think the dissent, there has to be the proper rule in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.462" offset="2257272">Another alternative from a practical and policy standpoint is, what is an informed tax attorney to advice to his accounting firm clients if the government's test is adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.381" offset="2300844">He advised them to lease their file storage room to all of their clients, so that even though they are working on their personal handmade records, there will be some kind of constructive possession theory that they rely on to prevent waiving their privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.519" offset="2361448">I don't know what else an informed attorney could advice and what about for instance, your particular taxpayer class.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.980" offset="2391333">You advise them to only permit their accountant to work on their personal records in the privacy of their own home and in the same room with them, with door bolted, preventing Internal Revenue Agent from intruding with the summons and grasping whatever record might happen to be in the accountant's hand at that moment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1463.264" offset="5956420">This was a voluntary act, he transferred ownership and he transferred possession and he published his records by making it a matter of public record with the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.368" offset="5992887">So this case is not related to the one before the court and neither is the case entitled Perlman v. the United States where we had a man who invented a pneumatic wheel and obtained a patent and he was himself in a patent litigation, he introduced the wheel and exhibits and diagrams and documents and there he conveyed title to the Equity Court, he conveyed possessions to the Equity Court, he published the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.478" offset="6093302">So I think that court is, that case is not in point, he was subsequently prosecuted for perjury and he tried to suppress this information but since you have transfer of possession and ownership and publication, I don’t -- those cases seem to me to be correct but not in point to the case before us.</text>

            <text syncTime="1645.940" offset="6687117">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.500" offset="6701328">In this case, as in Donaldson against the United States, a joint investigation by a Revenue Agent and a Special Agent is proceeding prior to any recommendation for a prosecution, and we believe that the issue of the statutory authorization for the issuance and enforcement of the summons in this situation was decided by the Court in Donaldson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.494" offset="6825357">It's true that in Donaldson, the taxpayer seeking to intervene and the summons enforcement proceeding there had, no proprietary interest and asserted no proprietary interest whatsoever in the corporate records of its former employees, that were the subject of the summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.990" offset="6915323">And because of that, the Court unanimously held that the taxpayer had no right to intervene in such a summons enforcement proceeding. Here by contrast, the taxpayer was permitted to intervene, indeed the government did not oppose the taxpayer's intervention because the taxpayer was asserting proprietary interest in the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.725" offset="7002258">But all of the discussion in the Donaldson opinion about the lack of the proprietary interest in the records was in the context of the initial issue, the intervention issue in Donaldson and two Justices of the Court expressed the view that that was all of the Court should decide in Donaldson, that the taxpayer had no right to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.760" offset="7086373">Seven Justices however proceeded in Donaldson to decide the issue that the taxpayer was seeking to raise through his intervention since the issue had been fully argued and was an important issue in the administration of the tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.639" offset="7157948">And in the Court's opinion, that issue was expressed as follows, Donaldson however strenuously urges in addition that an Internal Revenue summons proceeding may not be utilized at all in aid of an investigation that has the potentiality of resulting in a recommendation that a criminal prosecution be instituted against the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.965" offset="7263274">There is no reference in this part of the Court's opinion who has a proprietary interest in the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.470" offset="7293262">Indeed, what the opinion does is explained the meaning of the Court's holding in Reisman which was the case in which the taxpayer was asserting a proprietary interest in the records.</text>

            <text syncTime="1813.174" offset="7356061">That is correct, the Dictum in Reisman, what the court did was explain the meaning of the Dictum in Riesman and interpret the statute with respect to the issuances of internal revenue summons, whether to the taxpayer, to those dealing with the taxpayer or in the particular case to former employers and we did not regard you the matter that has been decided only two terms ago and it was fully briefed in the Donaldson brief in our case on pages 24 through 38 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.802" offset="7490539">In Donaldson in our view that issue has been decided and the new issue presented in this case as we view it, the principle the issue is rather the issuance and enforcement of the summons here, are inconsistent with the taxpayers Fifth Amendment privilege that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.495" offset="7609344">We will turn to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.471" offset="7613210">Now in one, perhaps attenuated sense of that language an accused is compelled to be a witness against himself, whenever a third person discloses in a proceeding what the accused has communicated to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.857" offset="7690846">When the third person is required to disclose it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.274" offset="7704430">Whether that communication was oral or written? Of course the Fifth Amendment has never been extended to that extreme and should not be in light of its historical purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.170" offset="7756048">If it were extended to that extreme, all communications instead of just a few specific categories if communications would be privileged communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.269" offset="7808397">Now as we understand it the petitioner here is not contending that communications to an accountant are privileged under Federal law and the case is uniformly holding or not and nor is it contended that the accountant cannot constitutionally be required to disclose communications the taxpayer made to him which may tend to incriminate the taxpayer, so long as the disclosure is in the form of oral testimony by the accountant of what the taxpayer communicated to him, or in the form of the production of records or documents owned by the accountant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.585" offset="7989687">So a claim here is that if the taxpayer owns the paper in the accountant's possession on which the information is written, the Fifth Amendment protects the taxpayer against the production of those records by the accountant, even though the information disclosed to the accountant is not privileged.</text>

            <text syncTime="3302.829" offset="13314696">Well, Your Honor, we believe and contend that the rights and questions are personal, the human civil type rights to protect one's documents and the compulsion, directed against one's agent who is holding one's papers on his behalf is equivalent to directing that same compulsion against the person himself I think, essentially a principle agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.137" offset="13431933">I don't see why a man's privileges should all be waived just by delivering his records to a temporary bailee, a mere naked possessor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.024" offset="13479476">It would appear to me that that would be no firm basis for waiving these privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.311" offset="13504658">We take the position here and look in for a moment at when this recommendation for criminal prosecution is raised or at what point it becomes a criminal matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.960" offset="13559202">Justice Brennan it seems to me if the taxpayer was not in jeopardy then why would the government for instance issue a Miranda warning telling her that she was in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.863" offset="13610820">If in fact, at the point the Special Agent comes in, we have at District Trial Court level and at the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, a volunteer to produce these records as the government will obtain immunity for us under Murphy v. Waterfront Commission, that line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.368" offset="13680828">The government steadfastly returns to grant immunity in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.498" offset="13697337">So they must be interested in this point in securing evidence for criminal prosecution otherwise they wouldn't give them the Miranda warning, nor would they refuse to grant us immunity if they are not interested in a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.338" offset="13760763">We don't – my opponent has cited the problem with of the Fourth Amendment following a line of cases on title, we suggest to test instants of ownership of these records that should be to test and rather than sticking to a strict title situational, although most of the cases cited in the government's brief in Perlman and Burdeau and Johnson and several other cases like that, they return on the title and ownership concept, and I suggest a careful reading of Justice Blackmunn's opinion in the Donaldson case were surely this court clearly set this particular question aside and did not decide in that case and the inference in that case and in Reisman v. Caplin, that these records are personal records and should be protected wherever they are, just as in the Fourth Amendment, I mean the Fourth Amendment search and seizure situation which we contend this falls under it too, because I think of necessity, of necessity documents that are subject to the Fifth Amendment privilege, any search and seizure by the government would be an unreasonable search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.566" offset="14041631">So I think that line of thought necessarily falls over in this area.</text>
