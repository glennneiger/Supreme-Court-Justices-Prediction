            <label>Mr. Stanley A. Bass</label>
            <text syncTime="33.498" offset="237380">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.819" offset="250650">This case is here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which affirmed the dismissal of a petition for writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.659" offset="285968">The District Court in dismissing the petition did not reach any substantive issues but denied the petition on the sole ground that the petitioner being enlarged on his own recognizance by the state trial Judge pending the outcome the federal habeas proceeding was not “in custody” for purposes of the federal habeas statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.058" offset="375620">The issue presented is whether or not a federal habeas Judge is without power to entertain a petition for the writ until the state criminal defendant who is sentenced to imprisonment surrenders into jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.430" offset="437060">Whether the defendant has exhausted his available state court remedies and has been permitted by the very judge who imposed the sentence to remain at large, pending the outcome of the federal habeas proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.667" offset="490036">The background facts will be briefly as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.203" offset="504142">The petitioner Hensley is a chief presiding officer of the Universal Life Church which has awarded honorary Doctor of Divinity degrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.743" offset="538311">He was charged of violating a California misdemeanor provision which prohibited the awarding of degrees which signify academic accomplishment without meeting accreditation requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.105" offset="583764">The trial was held on May 19, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.415" offset="597034">At the close of the State’s case, the defendant moved to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.114" offset="611871">The court held that it lacks jurisdiction in the State all throughout the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.835" offset="626709">Subsequently, the State moved to reopen the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.069" offset="639666">Mr. Bienvenu, the defendant’s counsel at that time declined to appear at the reopening.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.618" offset="661817">He advised the prosecutor that neither he nor Hensley would appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.141" offset="683969">However, the traverse in this case states that Hensley was never advised by Mr. Bienvenu that he had to appear or that his failure to appear would result in conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.637" offset="725870">On the contrary, he says, he was advised that the trial was dismissed and that he did not appear further.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="160.341" offset="744782">Is that still relevant to us?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Stanley A. Bass</label>
            <text syncTime="163.147" offset="755963">That may be relevant in so far as we deal with his status on release on recognizance or whether or not there’s been a deliberate bypass.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.833" offset="794728">I think it may not be relevant, however, it’s offered in case questions do arise with respect to that but the Court held in defendant’s absence that the Court had jurisdiction and it found the defendant guilty in absentia.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.302" offset="860557">And on July 1, 1969, one year imprisonment was imposed plus a $625 fine and costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.189" offset="900159">And at that time, the state trial judge granted a stay and allowed the defendant to remain on his own recognizance of pending appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.217" offset="940283">Subsequently, the conviction was affirmed and state trial judge permitted Hensley to remain on O.R. pending the exhaustion of state post conviction remedies which were habeas corpus in the District Court of Appeal and in the California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.895" offset="998902">Then on June 16, 1970, Hensley filed his federal habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.804" offset="1014575">On the same day, the State trial judge granted a stay, an additional stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.151" offset="1032025">Permitting him to remain at large, pending the determination of the federal habeas corpus application.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.097" offset="1059715">Federal habeas corpus judge found that or ruled that Hensley was not in custody because he was on recognizance and he denied the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.380" offset="1104854">However, he granted a certificate of probable cause and the Court of Appeals affirmed, rehearing was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.069" offset="1131604">A timely petition for cert. was filed and this Court granted cert.</text>

            <text syncTime="261.474" offset="1149262">Mr. Bass, as the practical matter, is this about the only factual situation in which this -- in which the federal habeas petitioner will have exhausted state remedies and still be free on his own recognizance?</text>
            <text syncTime="278.046" offset="1215509">I would think during the course of his appeal on state courts, for example, he can’t get federal habeas because he hasn’t exhausted his state remedies and that it might be a fairly limited situation in which this type of thing would occur?</text>

            <label>Mr. Stanley A. Bass</label>
            <text syncTime="291.899" offset="1270993">Well, we don’t get into the question as to whether or not the state remedies are so ineffective as to check the rights of the petitioner that we have a question under 2254.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.505" offset="1313416">Here, since Hensley was permitted to remain at large by the state trial judge, he exhausted all of his state remedies without the problem of his having to surrender and his sentence running and the question of possibly becoming moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.963" offset="1363257">Here, the issue was preserved because at all times, he was permitted to remain on his recognizance by the state trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.365" offset="1396799">The important factor to note is that the state trial judge who permitted Hensley to remain on his recognizance may well have felt that Hensley’s failure to appear in trial was not intentional and would have a bearing at such time as the Federal Court reaches the question of deliberate bypass.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.418" offset="1469001">But it would appear that by releasing --</text>

            <text syncTime="714.678" offset="2962056">The state’s argument here is not based upon any legitimate needs of federal judicial administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.495" offset="2985357">It’s not based upon any law enforcement needs but is based strictly upon an outmoded conceptual definition.</text>

            <text syncTime="741.157" offset="3068008">Secondly, if he is not committed to file the habeas while he is on recognizance and must go into jail, there would be more pressure on the District Court to move more quickly, to hear the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="785.296" offset="3244596">In Peyton versus Rowe, this Court allowed the use of anticipatory attack upon a future sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.976" offset="3275316">In Jones versus Cunningham, it was unnecessary to wait until parole was revoked before Jones could bring the habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.893" offset="3302902">In Strait versus Laird, it was unnecessary to wait until the servicemen were reactivated before he could bring his conscientious objector application.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.751" offset="3338428">In this case, we deal not with the question of a District Court’s discretion but simply with the question of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.101" offset="3363819">There is no need here, for example, for the Federal Court to determine if bail should be granted because the state trial judge has already granted the stay while he exhausts the federal habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.449" offset="3405197">This is the reverse situation of the case in the California Supreme Court called In re Smiley.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.697" offset="3430170">There, a Federal Court granted on recognizance release and the California Supreme Court said that they had jurisdiction to grant habeas relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1861.086" offset="7547695">But here, because of the -- Judge Nelson wanting to do the defendant a favor if you will, and Mr. Stromer continued temporarily or stayed temporarily until such time as there was a consideration of the habeas petition by the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.987" offset="7607359">Thereafter, the matter was taken out of Judge Nelson’s hands by the subsequent stays that were issued by the Ninth Circuit and by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1903.482" offset="7717282">Now, the Court has regularly defined or expanded on what is custody, what status someone has to be in, in order to be in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.851" offset="7754794">In Jones, it indicated that a parolee is in custody because he can’t drive a car, he can’t work without the permission of the parole officer, he can’t go places or do things.</text>

            <text syncTime="1926.651" offset="7809964">This defendant in this case, his whereabouts are totally unknown, at least as far as the people are concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="3037.935" offset="12255065">For the record, after the federal habeas was denied, the state trial judge then granted another stay of about 12 days and that was the stay that kept him out until Mr. Justice Black acted on August the 12th.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.968" offset="12311280">The habeas petition was denied on July 31, so that the -- there was dovetailing throughout of stay orders that were granted by the state trial judge before the federal judge did know.</text>

            <text syncTime="3065.753" offset="12366346">Did I get the impression that you thought that you said before that going in, in this process of surrendering himself to custody of the state and then immediately filing on a petition for habeas corpus in the Federal Court and asking, was this a meaningless ritual, is that?</text>

            <text syncTime="3087.410" offset="12452968">I thought it was a meaningless ritual for the petitioner to have to go through.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.342" offset="12472717">I also have mentioned in the brief that I thought that it would be an extremely inadequate remedy to suggest that all he has to do is surrender either into the anteroom or to the institution of confinement and then he could probably be bailed by a federal judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.184" offset="12528097">The two circuits, the Fifth and the Eighth Circuit that decided the issue the other way, contrary to the Ninth Circuit, both involved civil rights cases coming out of itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.683" offset="12570102">And it was no accident that in those cases it was extremely important that the person who is still out on some sort of former release be allowed to seek vindication in the federal courts in a timely fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.789" offset="12618480">And we submit that there really is no reason other than just a definitional one which is outmoded, and we think has been superseded by Strait versus Laird and all of the pervious cases that this person can be considered in custody for the purposes of 2241 (c) (3).</text>
