            <text syncTime="56.907" offset="331003">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.253" offset="344377">This case arises under the Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.605" offset="369768">For the convenience of the Court, I’ve asked the clerk to distribute to each member of the Court a pamphlet containing the full provisions of the Clean Air Act as amended in through the 1970 Amendments, plus two excerpts from the Federal Register reproducing completely the parts of the administrator’s regulations that are at issue in this case, so that all of these provisions can be seen in full context.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.601" offset="505814">The 1970 amendments greatly strengthened the Act in a number of ways and among other things, the amendments for the first time provided for federally prescribed national ambient air quality standards and for federal standards before emissions from new stationary sources of pollutants.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.609" offset="609782">The ambient air quality standards apply to the presence of pollutants in the overall air in a community or region covered by the standards and the emission standards also referred to as performance standards in the act apply to the emissions of pollutants from a single point source.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.706" offset="714167">Under the 1970 amendments, each state is required to submit a plan for implementing the national ambient air quality standards and the question in this case is whether those plans also have to prevent deterioration of existing air quality in any portion of any state.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.572" offset="805700">The administrator has taken the position of the act does not require or permit him to require the States to include such a non-deterioration provision in their plans although it preserves the right of the States to do so if they wish.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.489" offset="897337">Respondents brought this suit for a declaratory judgment to the contrary of the administrator’s position and to direct the administrator to disapprove the state plans that have been submitted in so far as they do not prevent significant deterioration of existing air quality in any part of any state.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.611" offset="993782">The District Court upheld the claim of the respondents on the basis of the Act’s statement of purposes and on the basis of the Court’s view of the ex-legislative history and what the Court regarded as inconsistency in the administrator’s regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.619" offset="1097853">It issued a preliminary injunction, which the parties agreed to treat as a final order for purposes of appeal and on appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed on the basis of the District Court’s opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.194" offset="1148113">This Court granted the Government’s petition for certiorari and the Government’s application for a stay pending its decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="758.827" offset="3138644">Well it was not mandatory for this Court to grant certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.008" offset="3159437">We petitioned and we presented the governing legal question as the question presented in the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.773" offset="3182425">We think that question is here in either context.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.707" offset="3206248">Now the opinion of the District Court adopted by the Court of Appeals in evaluating the probability of success of the legal issues does not discuss any of the operative provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.584" offset="3269674">Although in our view, Congress in these provisions answered with complete clarity and with great specificity the underlying legal question that’s before this Court and I would like now to turn to these operative provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.306" offset="3356609">In the pamphlet that’s been passed out to the justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.600" offset="3377821">The structure of the Act relevant here begins with Section 108 on page 9 of this pamphlet which specifies that, “The administrator is to adopt criteria for each of the individual pollutants to be found in the ambient air” and the administrator has done so with respect to all of the common pollutants whether additional ones will be added remains subject to continuing review.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.223" offset="3524315">Then Section 109 on page 10 specifies, “That the administrator on the basis of these criteria for individual pollutants then will adopt what are called the national ambient air quality standards.”</text>
            <text syncTime="875.351" offset="3604773">Two standards are to be adopted by the administrator and have been adopted by the administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.523" offset="3629432">Our national primary ambient air quality standard defined as standard requisite to protect the public health and the national secondary ambient air quality standard defined at the top of page 11 as requisite to protect the public welfare from any known or anticipated adverse effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.422" offset="3729011">And Public Welfare is very broadly defined on page 48 of this pamphlet in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.139" offset="3759940">Section 300 2 (h) which says, “That all language referring to effects on welfare includes but is not limited to effects on soils, water, crops, vegetation, man-made materials, animals, wildlife, weather, visibility and climate damage to, and deterioration of property and hazards to transportation as well as effects on economic values and on personal comfort and well-being.”</text>
            <text syncTime="942.183" offset="3872057">These standards are very far reaching and have been adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.452" offset="3889194">They are not subject to collateral review in this case for reasons explained in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.699" offset="3910196">There is a statutory provision specifying another word for review of the standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.863" offset="3946872">So this case was decided and should be decided on the premise that the standards adopted by the administrator are fully adequate to prevent in the ambient air any known or anticipated adverse effects on health, vegetation, and all of the other factors covered in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.070" offset="4059617">The standards themselves are subject to continuous review and revision by the administrator as additional scientific information becomes available.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.042" offset="4099532">But these are stringent standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.943" offset="4107160">The Environmental Protection Agency is of the view that many urban areas will have extreme difficulty conforming even to the primary standard and even greater difficulty conforming to the secondary standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.725" offset="4174242">Now, the key provision for purposes of this case is Section 110 entitled Implementation Plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.594" offset="4217710">And that title is in the public law in the statute’s at large all of these titles are and that Section requires each stay to adopt and submit a plan providing for the implementation maintenance enforcement of the primary standard and a plan providing for implementation maintenance enforcement and enforcement of the secondary standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.271" offset="4332440">That’s all in a 110 (a) (1) and then 110 (a) (2) specifies that the administrator shall, the second sentence of that, shall approve such plan submitted to him or any portion thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.371" offset="4404851">If he determines that it was adopted after reasonable notice and hearing and that, and then they are listed A through H. Eight additional requirements that the plan must meet and if it meets those eight requirements and it was adopted after reasonable notice and hearing, the Act says on its face the administrator shall approve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.453" offset="4509236">It is undisputed that none of these eight requirements are -- adds a requirement that the plan provide against significant deterioration of existing air quality other than the requirement that the primary and secondary standards be met, which is part A.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.427" offset="4605053">The others are all concerned with different subject matter and are tied in with meeting the primary and secondary standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.187" offset="4640162">Now we think it is significant that this provision does not even say the administrator shall not approve such plan unless it meets these criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.143" offset="4687914">It speaks in the positive in the mandatory sense he shall approve but if it does meet these standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.040" offset="4719574">It has long been the view of the agency of that if a plan were submitted by a state, which admittedly met all the standards and yet disapproved it; it would have a very week position in court if sued by that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.428" offset="4781119">And it did not think it could prevail in such a suit and of course the case did not arise in that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.510" offset="4813406">Now in addition to, I might add that there are other portions of Section 110, which reaffirm that the plans or implementation plans for these federally prescribed standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.932" offset="4883101">I refer the Court in particular to subpart H there in this list of eight requirements, which says that the plan must provide for revision and number 2, whenever the administrator finds on the basis of information available to him that the plan is substantially inadequate to achieve the national ambient air quality primary or secondary standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.203" offset="4992188">Not that’s inadequate for some other purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.413" offset="5021027">The only definition of the plan in the Act is subpart D on page 13 in Section 110, which says, “For purposes of this Act an applicable implementation plan is the implementation plan which has been approved under subsection (a) are promulgated by the administrator under subsection (c) in which implements the national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard in the state.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.777" offset="5142444">The Act provides for an additional requirement and that is the Section 111 requirement on performance standards for new stationary sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.237" offset="5204302">This is a part from the primary and secondary ambient air quality requirements and I won’t have time to go into that in any detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.217" offset="5256234">But it is significant that the Act defines standard of performance to mean at the beginning of Section 111, “A standard for emissions of air pollutants, which reflects the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction which taking into account the cost of achieving such reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.769" offset="5354454">The administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.458" offset="5377233">Now, all of this indicates that there are two requirements being imposed by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.923" offset="5415058">One the national ambient air quality standards and the other, emission limitation requirements, which not preclude new development that which impose a practical best available limitation taking cost into account as a protection that applies as well to areas where the existing air quality exceeds that of the primary and secondary standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.071" offset="5523623">And then Section 116 of the Act specifies that the States are free to adopt more stringent standards for the ambient air if they care to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.107" offset="5571793">And this is in keeping with the finding recited in Section 101 (a) (3) of the Act that the prevention in control of air pollution at its source is the primary responsibility of states and local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.992" offset="5651310">Now this interpretation of the Act is also corroborated by other in court into provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.799" offset="5678582">The entire structure of the Act looks toward these implementation plans as being just what they are called plans to implement the primary and secondary standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.659" offset="5717974">Section 107 (a) of the Act on page 8 succinctly spells out what the States responsibility is and again it’s just have been an implementation plan for such state which will specify the manner in which national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards will be achieved in and maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.985" offset="5803342">And then one of the most persuasive provisions further corroborating the meaning of the Act and the entire scheme of it is to be found on page 41 of the pamphlet of the Act and that is Section 211 (c) (4) (C), the capital C just below the middle of the page on page 41.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.703" offset="5910235">I apologize that this was a mistakenly referred to in our reply brief as Section 210.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.052" offset="5931551">It is actually Section 211.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.942" offset="5947120">Subpart 4 basically, preempts the States from regulating fuels or fuel additives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.292" offset="5976586">But this Subpart capital C says that the administrator may however approve a provision regulating fuels or fuel additives and implementation plans or promulgate an implementation plan containing such a provision but only if he finds that the State control or prohibition is necessary to achieve the national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard, which the plan implements.</text>

            <text syncTime="1578.256" offset="6416384">This Court granted a stay later in the context of a situation where the States would have had to devote resources to implementing the District Court’s order rather than to implementing the rest of the plans, which are in effect and were approved by the administrator.</text>

            <text syncTime="1625.755" offset="6606346">Now, the obvious purpose of this provision C was to permit the States to regulate fuels or fuel additives when they had to do so in order to comply with what the Federal Act requires of them in their implementation plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.606" offset="6673847">But they aren’t allowed to do so in order to effectuate anything additional in their implementation plans that they may have put in of their own volition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1697.441" offset="6893171">I would like you turn just to the outset to this question about the preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.392" offset="6912920">If you look at pages 31 to 32 of the appendix, at the very bottom of page 31, the District Court stated having considered the stated purpose of the Clean Air Act of 1970 the legislative history of the Act and its predecessor in the past and present administrative interpretation of the Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.855" offset="6994840">It is our judgment that the Clean Air Act of 1970 is based on important part on a policy of non-degradation of existing Clear Air and that 40 CFR 51.12(b) in permitting the States to submit plans, which allow pollution levels of Clean Air to rise to the secondary standard of pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.461" offset="7069236">It is contrary to the legislative policy of the Act and is therefore invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.801" offset="7086582">Now admittedly the Court then went on in the next Section under injunctive relief to say there was likelihood of success but in fact what the parties did is interpret that sentence that I have just read to you as an effect to final conclusion that that regulation was invalid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1836.735" offset="7450311">It involves any area where air quality is better than one or more of the secondary standards for the six pollutants and therefore this case will vitally effect all rural areas, suburban areas and even a great many urban areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.315" offset="7508616">Petitioner adopted a regulation, which would allow all these areas, the air in them to deteriorate to the secondary standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.917" offset="7539022">We believe that the result will be massive deterioration of air quality both measured by the area affected and by the total pollution emitted into the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.462" offset="7577266">While the pollution in cities will be lowered under the statute to the secondary standards over the next few years and many particularly clean areas pollution will increase five, ten, or even more times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.481" offset="7629302">Since there will be an increase in pollution in far more areas than it will be reduced, a vast increase in pollution will result.</text>

            <text syncTime="1892.339" offset="7672769">Pollution has increased drastically in the formerly almost pure air of the southwest, as coal-burning power plants have been located there over the last few years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1994.640" offset="8081951">Let me give an explicit example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.883" offset="8094908">Arizona supports the Government in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.237" offset="8104312">New Mexico supports respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.432" offset="8113089">Both of them are now threatened with coal-burning power plants that will add drastically to air pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.469" offset="8133256">If New Mexico imposes, a very strict standard then those power plants will be built in Arizona but New Mexico will get the dirty air from Arizona and so the net result to New Mexico will be that they will still get their air pollution but they will not get the economic benefits of the power plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.553" offset="8209533">Now what these States are arguing is that if in fact there is a national requirement as they believe the law provides that there would be no significant deterioration of Clean Air then the rule they will be the same nationally, then industry will not locate it one street versus another because of the low air pollution standard that industry will then use all of its funds and resources to develop methods for not significantly deteriorating the air and still being able to do the things, which the country needs to have done.</text>

            <text syncTime="2066.440" offset="8369089">That’s right and that of course is what President Nixon said in proposing the 1970 Statute and we have cited a number of studies in our brief which shows that air pollution moves long distances across state lines that there was a serious air pollution problem in Miami which came from the Northeast that there have been serious air pollution problems in Oklahoma which came from the Great Lake states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.797" offset="8450591">There is no way for a state to protect its air by prohibiting significant deterioration unless the other states that are nearby also do the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.347" offset="8488730">Now, we submit that the statute itself is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.373" offset="8504822">The Congress called the 1970 amendments the Clean Air Act and that that act states as the first of its purposes that it was designed to protect and enhance the quality of the nation’s air resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.704" offset="8554141">We submit the petitioner’s regulation cannot produce clean air and will not enhance or even maintain existing air property and we believe that it is inconsistent with the language of the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.491" offset="8601370">But whether or not the statutory language itself is clear enough, the legislative history in this case is overwhelming.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.909" offset="8631045">It is interesting that the Government in oral argument here has not eluded it all to this legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.614" offset="8657795">In fact, they have not in either of their two briefs alluded to some of the most important elements of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.239" offset="8680364">Let me just briefly state what those are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.476" offset="8693321">First in 1967, the protect and enhance language was first put into the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.755" offset="8714428">The Senate Report said that this language was designed to enhance air quality and to reduce harmful emissions anywhere in the country not just in areas of high pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.730" offset="8758314">The history of the 1970 Act which Section -- which left Section 1857 unchanged is even more clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.792" offset="8790497">John Benjamin, then the undersecretary of the HEW which enforced the air pollution law at that time read a statement on behalf of Secretary Finch and the administration to both the Senate and House Committees considering the 1970 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.268" offset="8848488">And this statement is on pages 27 to 28 of our red brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.283" offset="8864475">It says, “One of the expressed purposes of the Clean Air Act is to protect and enhance the quality of the nation’s air resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.347" offset="8896763">Accordingly, it has been and will continue to be our view that implementation plans that would permit significant deterioration of air quality in any area would be in conflict with this provision of the Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.644" offset="8949948">We submit that’s our case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2299.926" offset="9303124">First of all, we think the language of the statute itself indicates that a massive deterioration of air quality was not intended by Congress, that that is not consistent with protecting and enhance air quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.190" offset="9348159">Second to what we have here is that the administration coming up, the people that enforce this statute coming up and telling Congress that a provision of the statute prohibits significant deterioration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.654" offset="9398000">Congress passes sweeping amendments in 1970 to strengthen the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.110" offset="9419839">It leaves that provision unchanged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.173" offset="9436035">Now, we submit that when the enforcers of the statute come to Congress and say, “This is what this provision means,” and Congress although modifying almost the whole rest of the Act does not touch that Section that that is at least persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.147" offset="9496012">Now, I will get on to what the Congress though itself said, because I think that’s important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.582" offset="9513671">Now, Secretary Benjamin also repeated that statement in effect in his own words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.100" offset="9535822">In the hearings before the House Committee which was considering the 1970 legislation, our witness representing the chemical industry protested that the Bill before Congress would constitute an unqualified edict against any or every degradation because the standards would apply to all area regions that are now were recreational or otherwise unindustrialized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.775" offset="9630490">He therefore proposed a flexible provision for balancing the equities as to each area in place of the national prohibition against significant deterioration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.006" offset="9675421">Congressman Rogers who was on the Committee, a ranking member of the Committee responded by vigorously opposing this proposal because it would allow clean air areas to be polluted, so that the country would be faced with having to clean them up later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.724" offset="9734248">Mr. Rogers’ statement is on page 31 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.299" offset="9748564">The Committee left intact Section 1857 which prohibited deterioration according to the administration witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.273" offset="9780433">In addition, the House Report, we think clearly adopted Congressman Roger’s position because it said that significant -- that it effectively said that significant deterioration was prohibited by stating the following, “the war against the air pollution will be carried out throughout the nation rather than only on particular geographical areas.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.002" offset="9863398">And then he went on to say, “effective pollution control requires both reduction of present pollution and prevention of new significant pollution problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.244" offset="9900387">That’s almost identical what Congressman Rogers had said in response to the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.637" offset="9921912">Now, let me turn to the Senate Report which underlies the 1970 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.874" offset="9942915">First it said that the statute applied nationally and did not apply just uniquely critical areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.957" offset="9971231">It then made clear that no state plan permitting significant deterioration of air quality should be approved by saying first deterioration of air quality should not be permitted except under circumstances where there is no available alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.879" offset="10034866">Now, if they stop there obviously what Congress would have meant would have been that in some instances at least, significant deterioration could be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.461" offset="10077184">But then the Committee went on to say that alternatives existed, it listed the alternatives and said deterioration need not occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.327" offset="10116681">And that’s on page 32 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.247" offset="10132355">Now, the language upon which the statement was based Section 1857 was in the 1967 Act and was not changed by the 1970 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.601" offset="10173733">Petitioner claims that the Senate Bill was later changed before its adoption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.973" offset="10195257">The only subsequent changes in the Bill after the Senate Report and this is basically a Senate Bill were to tighten the provisions designed to reduce pollution in dirty air areas, in other words in the cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.705" offset="10246144">The tightening of controls as to dirty air areas obviously cannot lead to any inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.118" offset="10267878">The Congress intended to weaken the Bill’s provisions as to clean air areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.230" offset="10296299">Now, petitioner in its reply brief quotes at considerable length summaries of the 1970 Act and says that if this very important provision were intended by Congress to apply to across the county, why was it not in this congressional summaries of the Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.893" offset="10358993">There is a simple answer to this contention and that is Section 1857 was not in the 1970 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.927" offset="10387101">It was in the 1967 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.692" offset="10398177">The 1970 statute contained only amendments to the 1967 statute and since Congress after being informed that Section 1857 prohibited significant deterioration decided to retain this provision without amendment, it was not in the 1970 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.689" offset="10474141">Therefore it is natural that the summaries of the 1970 Act did not include a summary of a provision which was not in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.566" offset="10509667">We submit that the -- not only as the legislative history strongly support of our position but the contemporaneous and consistent administrative interpretation until 1971 was likewise the Section 1857 prohibited significant deterioration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.691" offset="10574137">Counsel has said that EPA has long said that implementation plans could not prohibit that there was no requirement that implementation plans had to prohibit significant deterioration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.579" offset="10629726">That long standing rule goes back to August 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.984" offset="10647280">In 1969, the National Air Pollution control administrations which then enforce the statute gave the States guidelines for its implementation plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.614" offset="10689808">Under the heading of requirements of the Air Quality Act, the States were told and this on page 26 of our brief, an explicit purpose of the Act is to protect and enhance the quality of the nation’s air resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.066" offset="10743620">Again, they were quoting Section 1857 from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.494" offset="10761383">Air quality standards which even if fully implemented would result in significant deterioration of air quality and any substantial portions of an air quality region clearly would conflict with the expressed purpose of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.533" offset="10821465">So what HEW told the States in 1969 was this identical language prohibited significant deterioration then Secretaries Finch and Benjamin told the Congress, both Houses of Congress the same thing in 1970 as their interpretation of the statute and their interpretation of the 1970 Administration Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.680" offset="10902131">Two other HEW officials, high officials told congressional committees the same thing in 1969 and 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.690" offset="10934105">And in 1971, petitioner promulgated his own national primary and secondary standards which we think plainly stated, the standard shall not be considered in any manner to allow significant deterioration of existing air quality in any portion of any state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.112" offset="11003800">We submit those regulations despite the rather elaborate attempt to explain a way that language is directly inconsistent with the regulation which is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.547" offset="11049566">Now petitioner, principally relies on Section 110 of the Act --</text>

            <text syncTime="2789.329" offset="11260740">Well, we don’t rely on it because we think the statute in its legislative history make the regulation invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.822" offset="11290624">We rely on that for the proposition that the administrator continued even into 1971 to believe that the statute prohibited significant deterioration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.718" offset="11326255">Even if we were wrong, I am at interpretation and the Government’s we think rather strained interpretation of that regulation is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.446" offset="11357184">We still believe that the statute in this legislative history and earlier administrative interpretation are conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.371" offset="11380903">We note particularly, Your Honors, that of course when one is looking to administrative interpretation to get the greatest way to this Court has said that it is the contemporaneous administrative interpretation which is most persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.623" offset="11433880">And that of course, occurred repeatedly in 1969 and 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.297" offset="11456554">As I indicated before we think the harder, what the Government is arguing is that Section 110 is conclusive on this case that it provides the only criteria from which the administrator can reject the State plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.802" offset="11506604">And that these criteria do not include a prohibition on significant deterioration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.481" offset="11529279">We believe that this contention is wrong for several different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.423" offset="11549027">First, the language of Section 1857 specifically states that it implies to the entire statute and we submit that means it applies to section 110 like it applies to everything else and that therefore there was no need to restate the prohibition against significant deterioration in Section 110 or any other portion of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.130" offset="11627917">Since Congress had been repeatedly told at least on four different occasions that section 1857 prohibited significant deterioration, Congress obviously did not consider it necessary to add another provision in Section 110 but decided to simply to leave section 1857 unchanged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.389" offset="11708897">Second, Section 110 allows the petitioner as petitioner emphasizes to enforce the national standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.734" offset="11742333">Since Section 1857 applies to the entire Act, we think it is clear the Congress intended the prohibition against significant deterioration to be part of the national standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.757" offset="11786428">This construction is confirmed by the fact that the statement in the Senate Report that state implementation plans may not permit significant deterioration is part of the report’s discussion of the national standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.231" offset="11840345">And if there’s doubt about this, petitioner himself is included a prohibition against significant deterioration in the national standard which he promulgated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.826" offset="11878693">Third, Section 110 or language comparable to it was contained in the 1967 statute, the 1970 bills considered by Congress and the 1970 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.340" offset="11928743">Nevertheless, both high federal officials and congressional committees stated repeatedly that Section 1857 requires state implementation plans to prevent significant deterioration.</text>

            <text syncTime="3222.249" offset="12992345">Congress was told that significant deterioration would conflict with the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3248.174" offset="13096103">But it was said over and over again and for example when the witness before the House Committee said, “The statute was an unqualified edict.” Congressman Rogers says, “That’s right and we’re going to keep it there.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.189" offset="13148139">And the House Committee did keep it there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.216" offset="13156185">And the House Committee said the reason we are keeping it there is because we want to prevent new pollution problems from arising.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.117" offset="13183875">Now what the Government is in effect saying is that the night -- and I think there isn’t much doubt about this, that they -- the very least they suggests this that the 1967 statute did prohibit significant deterioration but now it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.222" offset="13248240">Now, that is in effect an argument that was has happened is that there has been a repeal by implication because the language is identical.</text>

            <text syncTime="3394.684" offset="13682082">Now the interesting thing is really the Government doesn’t have any substantial answer to this. What the reply brief says and I guess this is supposed to be the answer to most of this.</text>

            <text syncTime="3406.255" offset="13728371">At the most this legislative history indicates that some individuals testifying on the bills and even some congressman believe in the policy of non-deterioration would be advisable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3497.935" offset="14095130">That’s the first argument on the proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.524" offset="14105475">An additional argument is that we think that means that this is prohibition on significant deterioration is part of the national standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.236" offset="14140270">In fact the administrator has made it part of the national standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.021" offset="14155421">Now, if you look through the list of the reasons one can turn down an implementation plan in Section 110.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.532" offset="14185514">Everybody agrees that one reason for turning it down is it does not comply with the national standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.399" offset="14208920">These made it a part of the national standards; we think he had to because Section 1857 applies to the entire statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.198" offset="14240162">Let me just make one final point because I know the red light is on and that is all the statements that I have talked about Secretaries Finch and Benjamin, the House Report, the Senate Report, the other legislative administrative history all apply to a statute which either had the identical provision as Section 110 or was -- had a provision similar to Section 110 in the sense that they require the administrator to approve implementation plans if they met certain criteria which did not include explicitly under within that Section, Section 110.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.771" offset="14390418">So all these legislative history, administrative history goes directly to this point of what Section 110 means in conjunction with Section 1857.</text>

            <text syncTime="3586.778" offset="14450500">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.182" offset="14464084">The counsel for the respondent has stated that under our interpretation of the Act there would be a massive increase in pollution across the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.431" offset="14505148">We disagree with that but there is no factual record in this case on that subject and even if that were true I do not think that gets as much insight into the significance of the protect and enhance language which is at the beginning of the Act in Section 101 since that language was carried over verbatim from the much weaker provisions of the 1967 Act which did not provide for federal standard of emissions at all from point of sources or for a federal standard of ambient air quality which had no application to areas of the country where there was not a public health or welfare problem such as that it is now covered by primary and secondary standards which had no provisions about fuel and fuel additives, no provision limiting aircraft, weaker provisions with respect to motor vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.755" offset="14758431">Now the significance of some of the testimony about that language, I think can only be appreciated in the context of the 1967 Act which was the basis of interpretations that Secretaries Benjamin and Finch and others at HEW had developed as of the significance of this provision in the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.194" offset="14864175">The 1967 Act required the states to develop their own standards to the applicable only an areas where there were significant health or welfare problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.552" offset="14925615">There was nothing in telling the States what those standards should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.751" offset="14946408">And HEW arrived at the conclusion that because the stated purpose of the Act was to protect and enhance the environment and it was to apply on these problem areas that the state standards to be develop by the States under those provisions should not allow significant deterioration of the air quality in those problem areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.961" offset="15043166">The standards under the 1970 Act has specified this primary and secondary standards which provide in detail the protection of health and welfare that was the concern of HEW in stating that those state standards develop under the 1967 Act should not allow for deterioration that’s going to cause health or welfare problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.514" offset="15149432">There is no weakening in the 1970 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.631" offset="15161866">The 1970 Act spells all of these out in detail and prevents the states from allowing deterioration that will in anyway cause any known or anticipated effect, adverse effect on health, on vegetation, and on any of the broadly defined protections of the 1970 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.651" offset="15242010">It goes much further than the 1967 Act does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.637" offset="15257893">There was admittedly some confusion in the testimony because of this other habit of mind of thinking what significance the provision could have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3801.190" offset="15308152">So when you look at the provision on the face of the Act in itself that requires nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.413" offset="15333021">It merely states the purpose of the Act and there is nothing to which the respondents can point in the entire Act to which this can meaningfully applied because every --</text>

            <text syncTime="3827.587" offset="15413687">He did not change his mind. I would like to explain that on the basis of these regulations just as soon as I finished making this one point that there is nothing in any of the operative provisions of the Act that can be interpreted in light of this statement which in itself requires nothing to add a requirement to the States because every place in the Act that it says at the states must submit a plan it has a plan to implement, there is a primary and secondary standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.419" offset="15537089">There is no general requirement of a state plan other than the plan for that purpose and Section 110 specifies in great detail exactly what is required in the plan that the administrator shall approve the plan if it meets those requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3876.755" offset="15610441">Now, the provisions that have been adopted in these regulations were adopted in two separate parts which I distributed to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.212" offset="15656208">It’s the part that was adopted in August is the part that purports to specify what the plans submitted by the States have to include and it is undisputed that that part does not include any requirements against significant deterioration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3907.307" offset="15732590">The part of this issue distributed in April of 1930 was not on the subject of the plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.222" offset="15760280">That was where the national primary and secondary ambient air qualities standards were adopted and the great bulk of these regulations concern the national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.134" offset="15815868">There is at the beginning and this is on page 8187, the very first page on the right as you opened up a little scope provision Section 410.2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3942.191" offset="15872188">That provision in parts A and B defines what these primary and secondary standards are, and then part C which is the one that’s disputed here in parts D were intended to be savings provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3958.191" offset="15936136">The respondents say that they would be redundant if both were regarded as savings provisions, where part d saves to the states the right to include in their plans requirements to go beyond the primary and secondary standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3973.135" offset="15995904">And part C saves to the States the right to impose requirements in any manner whether in their plans or not to go beyond the primary and secondary requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3985.347" offset="16044805">Part C is peculiarly worded in light of this legislative background.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.201" offset="16064136">I asked the environmental protection agency why this peculiar wording should have been used in the savings provision and they told me that it was put in as an accommodation to the environmental groups because it was known that the environmental groups were like to try to persuade the States to adopt requirements against any significant deterioration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.663" offset="16158072">And they wanted to make clear that the national primary and secondary standards were not to have the effect of authorizing any significant deterioration if the States chose to forbid it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4025.564" offset="16205615">That is the reason why this peculiar language was used in the savings provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.029" offset="16223483">These regulations are not bout what the state plans have to include they are about the standards that were being promulgated as primary and secondary standards with no inconsistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="4044.971" offset="16283251">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
