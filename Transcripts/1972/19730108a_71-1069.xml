            <text syncTime="389.702" offset="1662203">Secondly, of course anything which affects the rent which would be charged upon that land would also affect a person who uses that land.</text>

            <label>Mr. Henry A. Burgess</label>
            <text syncTime="415.510" offset="1765439">No Your Honor I think that the right to vote is something that is granted by this particular case by this particular act.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.893" offset="1798980">The act says that a land owner may vote, and all other parties were excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.223" offset="1824266">So it would seem to me that if you are not a land owner, it does not make any difference while your tenancyis wanted sufferance for a year or for 99 years, in any event you are excluded from voting.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="442.219" offset="1872227">But in order to as maintain -- you have standard to maintain your constitutional issue, you got to show that if the constitution were applied in the way you say it be then your client would end up having right to vote.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="henry_a_burgess" startTime="453.950" stopTime="768.241">
            <label>Mr. Henry A. Burgess</label>
            <text syncTime="453.950" offset="1919143">Correct I understand that and that is why in the interrogatories and the order of the Court, the Court did allow Johnston Fuel Liners to intervene finding perhaps not expressly but certainly by implication and as a general orders that all of the facts and legal conclusions necessary enter the order or embodies in that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.912" offset="2026977">As I say, the case arises under the statutes of relating to the Watershed Improvement District and the purposes of that district of course, or to provide for the prevention and control of erosion, flood water, sediment damage is to provide for storage, conservation, development, utilization and disposal of water, there by to preserve and protect land and water resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.959" offset="2131257">It is also designed as statutory purpose states, from all the health, safety and general welfare, the people they state.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.147" offset="2163963">Now, this district is formed by the written petition being filed by land owners with the Board of Directors, what is called Water and Soil Conservation District which board then determines whether or not in their opinion the district would be feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.962" offset="2251212">Thereafter, if it is determined that it would be feasible a referendum has had.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.538" offset="2277543">Our statute provides no qualifications for the boarders except that you have to be a land owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.592" offset="2321742">The land owner is defined by the statute that as being one who holds the legal title or is acquiring title by a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.802" offset="2358627">There is no qualification as to residence, a non-resident land owner, one outside of the state may vote, a minor may vote by a guardian and deceased to state by an executive and there is no registration requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.357" offset="2432815">Now prior to the actual casting of the ballot, the land owner must make an affidavit in which he states the number of acres he owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.310" offset="2472626">He then votes and as the ballots are counted and in order to pass the referendum must have voting in favor of it, a majority of the land owners who also represent a majority of the acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.617" offset="2545873">So in effect the vote is weighted.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.547" offset="2565517">Now, after the creation of the district, a Board of Directors is elected to operate a district, there are five of them and in order to be nominated you have to be nominated by ten land owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.657" offset="2626017">Upon the creation of the district, the statute states it constitutes a governmental subdivision of the state and a public body corporate and politic, they have the authority to levy taxes, make assessments, build structures, accept grants, apportion benefits against irrigated lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.144" offset="2691950">They also have the authority to submit to the land owners, a proposition for the issuance of the bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.755" offset="2726431">Now, once again, only the land owners vote on the bonds, the vote must carry by two-thirds of the land owners voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.301" offset="2768541">And those two-thirds must own a majority of the acreage.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.315" offset="2784632">So once again you have a waiting of the vote in comparison to number of acre zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.393" offset="2812949">Now, in this particular case, it was argued of course, in the lower courts that the limiting of voter franchise to the land owners in the creation and maintenance of Watershed Improvement District violates the Fourteenth Amendment, Equal Protection clause and that it creates an unreasonable arbitrary and capricious voting classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.309" offset="2904586">The second argument was that the weighting of these votes by requiring a majority of the acreage is at the basement of the votes and the people resident in the district and the owners of small acreages.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.130" offset="2951920">Our Supreme Court held that while Wyoming is always recognized the distinction between governmental and proprietary functions of a legal subdivision and that this was a legal subdivision, that a Watershed Improvement District functions are primarily proprietary, and then they stated that the appellants in that case would fail to show that the statute was unconstitutional and that the classification of the burden showing this classification of orders was upon the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.400" offset="3076995">Our court also made the observation that there is an overreaction to the decisions of this court, both by judges and lawyers, that the one man one vote rule has been extended to a local specialized unit of government, and Wyoming Supreme Court rejected the idea or extend the rules include such water a improvement district.</text>

            <text syncTime="1294.077" offset="5279640">Secondly, in Wyoming there is a statute which specifically provides that you are a tenant at sufferance unless you have a specific written lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.010" offset="5327391">So in this case, there are a candidate sufferance although the Wyoming Supreme court passed over that question when I raised it in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.767" offset="5362395">Secondly, with regard to the question on paying for this, the district is originally formed as an (Inaudible) would indicate on a watershed area, the drainage is all the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.397" offset="5420910">Then after the district is formed and after they have decided that it is feasible to build a dam in a certain location, then only the lands that are benefited below that dam are assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.033" offset="5479528">In other words, not all of the lands that is in the watershed district, much of it is in the mountainous area, this area in particular is an outlying area, the lowest elevation I suppose in the district would be 6900 feet running from there to about 7200 feet.</text>

            <text syncTime="1379.870" offset="5622888">The meadows that are irrigated here will only grow in hay because of the altitude and the shortness of the growing season.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.572" offset="5649638">There probably is 2000 acres involved belonging to about 12 different families.</text>

            <text syncTime="2207.734" offset="8934275">I think also, that it's not fair for a lessee, who may be tenant at sufferance or at least for a term of years to be allowed to come in and push through a large expensive project -- the payoff on this is estimated as 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.260" offset="8992371">And he may be there a year of two and pull out and leave the landlord with $3 ½ or $4 a year assessment to pay on this project.</text>

            <text syncTime="2357.022" offset="9531434">It is a governmental entity, but it exercises no sovereign power over the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.861" offset="9550764">None of the --- it's more in the nature of a quasi-private corporation or quasi-public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.476" offset="9573230">It has a power to levy and collect assessments, which almost any mutual company would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.386" offset="9592874">It has the power to buy and sell real estate and personal property and the power to borrow money and sell bonds which any private corporation can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.394" offset="9624952">It does have the power to receive government grants and loans, that I think, the (Inaudible) corporation has that power also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.957" offset="9659225">And it has the power of eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.605" offset="9665808">Now there seems to be in counsel's brief, a great distinction made because of this branding of the power of eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.795" offset="9694542">Every private or public utility has the power to eminent domain.</text>

            <text syncTime="2747.669" offset="11094079">A small community like Wyoming, at first place we all think we are honest, secondly, the people come in and they are pretty well known to their neighbors and they are that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.367" offset="11132844">When you get all through looking at this case, I think that historically these cases started on a question of voting for Congress and then it got over to voting of a school trustee, and then the county commissioner, and you keep growing down and down and down into the spectrum of local self-government, and we contend that this principle should also be extended into the lower unit of this particular water improvement district.</text>
