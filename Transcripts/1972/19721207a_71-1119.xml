            <text syncTime="7.220" offset="132263">This appeal by the Indiana Employment Security Division presents the issue of validity of certain practices used by the Division in determining the eligibility of claimants for unemployment compensation benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.488" offset="197360">These practices which are called for by the Indiana Law, were held by a three-judge district court not to comply with requirements of the Social Security Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. Darrel K. Diamond</label>
            <text syncTime="93.358" offset="476766">They had in fact been granted much earlier on the basis of the preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order issued by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.564" offset="513651">The facts of Mrs. Burney's particular case were moot well before the district court entered its judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.600" offset="541759">In fact, it became moot at the time the referee providing the type of hearing which was required by the district court order determined that she was not eligible for benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.354" offset="604766">In this case, the first determination by the deputy was that Mrs. Burney was not eligible for benefits in that she was unduly restricting the hours in which she was available for work.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.175" offset="660041">The referee after a full hearing upheld that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.720" offset="686268">The review board after going over the case, hearing argument determined that the restriction upon her hours of possible work was not so severe as to indicate that she was not available for work within the statutory meaning.</text>

            <label>Mr. Darrel K. Diamond</label>

            <text syncTime="172.040" offset="791489">There was no appeal to the Indiana Court of appeals on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.541" offset="805491">So, Mrs. Burney's case was moot at this point in the same way that the Java case, also an unemployment compensation case, was moot well before it ever came before the courts for final decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.104" offset="867767">This was a class action, although her particular claim was not designated as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.196" offset="900159">The district court clearly stated that it was ruling on behalf of Mrs. Burney and of a subclass within the original case.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.358" offset="936835">In the original case, there were actually two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.232" offset="948328">One being precisely identical to the Java issue and the other Mrs. Burney's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.419" offset="977063">So the district court divided this into two subclasses while Mrs. Burney's particular case was moot at a very early stage this is a class action within the scope of the district court opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="632.969" offset="2635212">If I may then, deal briefly with the types of determinations which are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.351" offset="2664782">In determining a claim for benefits, there are basically three determinations to be made, breaking this down into three as far as appropriate analysis, as a matter of law, there are only two.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.059" offset="2727581">The first of these is the determination of insured status.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.774" offset="2746493">This is merely whether the claimant has had enough work and has earned wage credits in a covered employment to be eligible for benefits if he meets the eligibility requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.097" offset="2807724">This determination says nothing about whether the person is eligible or not eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.521" offset="2829458">In fact, a person can even request this determination when he is still employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.383" offset="2848893">The second determination goes to eligibility and this, I have broken down into two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.536" offset="2873553">The first issue, going to the reason for termination of the prior employment, that is basically whether the termination was attributable to the employer or to the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.611" offset="2937814">The third issue, which is involved in this case is a continuing question of the conduct of the claimant during the period of the unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.045" offset="2991522">Each week, the claimant is required to well, continue to be unemployed, to be able to work, to be available for work, to be making an independent effort to secure work, to not have refused an offer of a suitable job or not have refused instructions by Division to apply for a job which would be suitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.850" offset="3094758">This determination is made each week by the Division and it is on this basis that the determination of eligibility for that week is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.358" offset="3144808">There is never any determination by the Division which would have any effect for any week prior -- past the time of that week.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.831" offset="3186709">This is like, in a sense, pay for looking for work and you don't get paid until after you have done the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.203" offset="3232162">When a person comes in each week to present his claim, he is required to establish that he has met these criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.695" offset="3286183">This establishment may come about by his certification, upon the voucher form that he has met these requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.990" offset="3323382">It may come by an interview or a hearing, an interview type hearing with a Claims Deputy.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.038" offset="3363506">This hearing would be basically similar to the hearing on an initial claim which was described by this Court in its opinion in the Case of California Department of Human Resources Development versus Java.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.929" offset="3431111">The party, the claimant is called in, the question which raises the doubt is discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.478" offset="3477295">If there is anyone else who would have information, the Deputy finds that information and he reaches a determination of whether or not the person was eligible for that particular week.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.616" offset="3541870">That decision is as much an initial decision in that sense as is the first week.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.591" offset="3573739">The only difference being that in the normal situation, it is not necessary each week to determine the questions of why the previous employment was terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.443" offset="3641135">In this case, Mrs. Burney was determined by the Division, by the Deputy not to be available for work in that she was unduly restricting the hours for which she was available for work and the other case was presenting the same issue, in the New York case of Torres, there was the plaintiff Mr. Dinger who was found by the Division not to be making an effort to secure work.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.841" offset="3774777">In the Vermont case of Wheeler versus Vermont, there was a determination there that the claimant had refused to seek work when directed by the Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.388" offset="3824933">In the California case, Mrs. Crow was determined to have refused an offer of suitable work.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.590" offset="3857742">When these questions arose, it was necessary to make a determination of the prior week's conduct because each of these questions is a condition precedent to eligibility for unemployment compensation benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.339" offset="3932766">This is a different type of system than the welfare system, in which there is an initial determination of status such as a family has a child or children who are dependent within the definition of 42 U.S.C Section 606, that is, a needy child living with a designated relative who is deprived of the parental support of at least one parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.043" offset="4059512">In those cases, once a determination is made, it continues in effect and it was necessary to have a hearing because a prior determination having continuing effect is now being changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.994" offset="4143313">The welfare recipient has no such affirmative duties to go out and look for work, to be available for work and not to review his work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.532" offset="4189497">So, we have a completely different situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.586" offset="4201723">The welfare situation is not applicable to this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.492" offset="4237354">In looking to this Court's decision in Java last year which was held by the District Court to be dispositive of the issue, I believe that the rule of law of the Java Court actually supports the position of the Division in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.840" offset="4334738">In Java, you had an initial determination by the Deputy in the California Department, as to the eligibility of a particular claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.351" offset="4396805">After that determination had been made, one of the parties to that case filed a notice appeal and that notice or appeal was sufficient in itself to call for determination of benefits, even though in that case, the Division had determined that the benefits were due.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.328" offset="4492727">So, you were allowing a party to upset the decision of the impartial agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.539" offset="4529507">In this case, we merely have the other party seeking to overturn the decision of the impartial agency that benefits are not due, this is merely two sides of the same coin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.606" offset="4597844">I would emphasize in this respect that the Indiana Employment Security Division is an impartial arbiter in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.234" offset="4640266">The State of Indiana and the Division have no interest in whether or not these payments are made, in the sense that the money used to pay these benefits comes from employers and not from the state treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.119" offset="4715813">The administrative expenses so long as the plan is held to be in compliance with the Federal Law are paid by the Federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.832" offset="4754683">The interest of the state agency is merely in having a workable system in which the authority of the impartial arbiter is upheld and the duties placed upon claimants by the Social Security Act and the State Unemployment Compensation Laws are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.830" offset="4850709">When Congress passed the provision to the Social Security Law dealing with the questions of Unemployment Compensation, they had before it a general outline of what Unemployment Compensation plan would be like and this included these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.873" offset="4938898">The District of Columbia Unemployment Compensation Code which was then passed by Congress, includes the same provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.053" offset="4979545">So as a result we have the determination by the agency that a party is not eligible for benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.160" offset="5028028">We have a claimant for whatever reason, in most cases probably because of a sincere questions as to the fact but as was pointed out in the Java case possibly by an arbitrary desire or merely by a desire to apply short run benefit may file a frivolous appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.947" offset="5123114">There is no way to determine this until the referee decision has been made and in some cases on from there to the Review Board and from there to the Indiana Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.713" offset="5182255">The issue of due process has been presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.567" offset="5217677">I am not sure that it is this issue in this case except to in the following way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.242" offset="5244322">The District Court did not rule on the due process issue presented under Goldberg versus Kelly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.627" offset="5277863">It did, however, require the division to provide a prior due process hearing and did not explain what that hearing should consist of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.810" offset="5326660">Division filed a motion for amendment of judgment to show what that hearing would consist of and the District Court refused that motion being unable or unwilling to say what a due process hearing is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.031" offset="5403460">I believe it's clear from the law that there is no such thing as a due process hearing in the sense of a specific set of requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.850" offset="5454764">Due process is a much more general phrase which would vary from period to period and from case to case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.918" offset="5491022">What is due process in one situation would not be due process in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.029" offset="5515473">And what maybe a denial of due process in one situation would provide due process in another situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.862" offset="5546820">Therefore, it's necessary to look at this question within the realm of the unemployment compensation and not in the question of welfare even though both of these are programs under the Social Security Act and determine whether the deputy determination would be a proper determination in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.791" offset="5662490">Whether the deputy determination is itself a due process hearing within the scope of the District Court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.840" offset="5706689">Since the District Court refused or wasn't able to clarify that order, the Division felt it was necessary to give it the strictest possible interpretation because they didn't know what might put them in contempt of Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1426.300" offset="5808567">Since the injunction was presented, there is the deputy determination which is basically the same question -- the same procedure as was presented in the Java case, that is the deputy interviews the claimant, interviews other persons having information about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.130" offset="5915878">Now in the above both the cases for example frequently there will be no employer party because the prior employer would have no way of having knowledge as to the behavior of the claimant after this period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.645" offset="5973974">After all of this information is presented and in most of these cases the information comes exclusively from the claimant himself, the deputy determines the facts and determines whether that brings a person within one of the limitations, whether in that situation the person is eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.629" offset="6057880">However, since the District Court injunction was entered, the deputy determination did made in the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.865" offset="6094869">However the deputy determination of ineligibility is not given effect if the claimant expresses a desire to appeal to a referee, but rather benefits are paid despite the fact that there has never been a determination of eligibility for that period until a referee hearing and the written formal referee opinion is handed down.</text>

            <text syncTime="3764.178" offset="15160090">Plaintiff Torres was determined initially eligible for benefits allegedly without the employer having any notice of the application and therefore, without being involved in the critical procedure which this Court described in Java.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.880" offset="15226859">So, to that extent, it is a very unusual circumstance which we clearly don't have here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3798.297" offset="15296554">Now, concerning the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.773" offset="15314422">In Goldberg, this Court found that welfare benefits could not be summarily terminated without affording the recipient a prior evidential hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.427" offset="15357053">As pointed our earlier, this case is uniquely like Goldberg and in many respects, it is even stronger than Goldberg.</text>

            <text syncTime="3832.168" offset="15432077">The interest of the State in a summary procedure are much less here than they were in Goldberg because of the recoupment provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.269" offset="15464469">As pointed out, the State recoups over 70% of any wrongful payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3845.138" offset="15483904">In Goldberg, the Court recognized there was virtually no chance of recoupment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3864.783" offset="15562480">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.033" offset="15579512">In addition here, the determination of unemployment compensation benefits is a serious deprivation and a serious loss to the recipient as was the welfare, even though initial eligibility is not based on an individual means test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3885.196" offset="15644191">Java and earlier decisions of this Court recognized that, Congress intended Unemployment Compensation to meet a short term need.</text>
            <text syncTime="3894.646" offset="15681912">Just as welfare provides funds for the old, disabled, blind and children, Unemployment Compensation provides funds for unemployed workers, during their short-term unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.017" offset="15727470">Now as pointed out in the legislative history, a means test was not used because there was an explicit effort to avoid the stigma of welfare and the welfare mentality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3918.067" offset="15775640">They didn't want workers to get into the -- relying on welfare and therefore, not look for jobs, but the need for a prior evidential hearing is very great here because of the complex factual issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.377" offset="15832900">Once a person is in this continued claim status after the initial determination of eligibility the issues that come up subsequently are usually as in Mrs. Burney's case, issues of availability and issues of refusal of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3947.611" offset="15893817">Indiana Courts have held that these questions involved questions of fact and depend on the circumstances in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3955.760" offset="15926418">For example, is the claimant restricting the hours of work?</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.268" offset="15940420">Is the claimant restricting herself to certain types of work?</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.174" offset="15956093">Is the claimant looking for work?</text>
            <text syncTime="3964.969" offset="15963199">Is the job suitable?</text>
            <text syncTime="3967.131" offset="15971871">Was there an actual offer of a job?</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.635" offset="15981902">Is the job safe?</text>
            <text syncTime="3971.006" offset="15987440">Is there transportation to the job?</text>
            <text syncTime="3972.938" offset="15995173">Is there babysitting?</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.519" offset="16001442">What were the previous work habits?</text>
            <text syncTime="3977.074" offset="16011682">Is the person physically fit to attend, to work at this job?</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.023" offset="16031431">We contend that reliable answers to such questions can best be obtained at an evidential hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3988.828" offset="16058702">I think the past experience of the division with a near 50% reversal rate indicates that there are -- in the past, there was not a reliable procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.289" offset="16104573">As pointed out earlier, the interest of the State here are much less than in the welfare situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.228" offset="16136234">The ones -- argument advanced by the State and the brief is the need to minimize expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4014.034" offset="16159535">Well, the State -- this is not convincing because of the recoupment procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="4020.778" offset="16186493">Indiana has been implementing this order for over a year now and there was no apparent great increase in the costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.078" offset="16223692">The issue, the numbers presented by the California situation, I think the decision there, the Crow decision had been in effect for over a year and I think those figures were actually rebutted by the opposition when that case came before this Court for an emergency cert.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.314" offset="16316583">The other argument advanced by the State is that this is going to create administrative chaos.</text>
            <text syncTime="4059.598" offset="16341765">The experience is that it simply has not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4062.374" offset="16352841">They have simply moved their referee hearing up in time and according to their own statistics is working very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="4070.944" offset="16387114">So, there is absolutely no demonstration of either great costs or administrative chaos here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4079.548" offset="16421595">The conclusion is as Congress recognized, we are dealing here with a program that is of critical importance to unemployed workers and our position is that only an evidential hearing prior to a termination of benefits can assure that the purposes of this program to get benefits to unemployed workers can adequately be met.</text>
