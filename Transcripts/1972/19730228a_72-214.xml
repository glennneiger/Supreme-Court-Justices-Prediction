            <text syncTime="35.529" offset="245530">Mr. Pollock, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Earl E. Pollock</label>
            <text syncTime="39.646" offset="261935">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.799" offset="274578">Within the past year, this is the third case to come before the Court, arising out of efforts to release the critical shortage of freight cars on the nation's railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.839" offset="342706">The other two cases Allegheny-Ludlum and Florida East Coast involve rules and rates intended to discourage delay in returning cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.758" offset="394428">This case involves railroad charges intended to discourage the in-transit inspection of grain and in that way reduce the wasteful use of cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.233" offset="448345">The new tariffs were published by the railroads almost exactly three years ago to become effective on March 28, 1970, but before the effective date, the Interstate Commerce Commission, acting under Section 15(7) of the Act suspended the charges for the maximum seven month period provided by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.963" offset="547192">The suspension was voluntarily extended by the affected railroads for an additional six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.722" offset="578226">The charges were finally put into effect in May 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.284" offset="600482">After extensive hearings, the Commission found that the charges were just and reasonable and also found that the charges would make a substantial contribution to the improvement of the national freight car supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.275" offset="668505">The District Court, the court below, set aside the Commission's order, in addition without any request by the plaintiffs to grant such relief, without any discussion of its authority to grant such relief, without any finding of irreplaceable injury, and indeed without any injunction findings whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.594" offset="769755">The District Court suspended the charges which are then been in effect for over a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.962" offset="795251">Thereafter, this Court entered and ordered which stayed the judgment below and which permitted the rates to go back into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.711" offset="842167">My co-counsel, Mrs. Christian, Associate General Counsel of the Commission will present the position of the appellants and the United States on the District Court's suspension of the charges, while my argument will deal with the District Court's decision on the merits of the Commission's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.380" offset="940910">These tariffs imposed charges for interrupting grain shipments for the purpose of in-transit inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.332" offset="984691">This service involves stopping a car loaded with grain while it is already en-route, switching the car to a separate track at a few locations in the country, where the car is held for sampling and grading of the contents, waiting for disposition orders from the shipper or his consignee after he receives the results of the inspection, and then eventually switching the car back into the regular line-haul movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.461" offset="1133171">The car delay resulting from this practice amounts on the average to more than three days for each and every inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.763" offset="1170474">Now this delay can readily be avoided by having the inspection, if an inspection is desired, made either at the point of origin or at the point of destination after delivery, or by omitting the inspection altogether as it's frequently done.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.822" offset="1250617">Historically, the nation's railroads have made separate charges for providing in-transit inspection service, but in the western district, unlike the east which has been doing this since 1963, these charges previously applied, although with a number of various substantial exceptions, only to the second and subsequent inspections on any one grain shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.072" offset="1363675">The first inspection in other words, was in the western district provided without additional charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.345" offset="1396799">This extraordinary practice grew out of a legal requirement which no longer exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.068" offset="1431594">Until five years ago, the inspection of interstate grain shipments was required by Federal Law, but in 1968, Congress repealed this requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.736" offset="1486346">At the same time, the Congress authorized inspection on the basis of so called submitted samples.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.655" offset="1521977">The result of these changes in the law is that under the law at present, any shipping point in the country can also be an inspection point.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.711" offset="1574222">The --</text>

            <text syncTime="368.577" offset="1577671">Under the former requirement that the inspection have to take place while the grain was in in-transit?</text>

            <text syncTime="374.276" offset="1600449">No, Mr. Justice Stewart, it did not have to be done while it was in transit, but as the Commission pointed out because of prior practice and because of convenience, the practice of in-transit inspection of grain continued.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="394.439" stopTime="395.417">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="394.439" offset="1681115">So it wasn't a requirement?</text>

          <turn speaker="earl_e_pollock" startTime="395.417" stopTime="417.077">
            <label>Mr. Earl E. Pollock</label>
            <text syncTime="395.417" offset="1685086">It was not required and in fact, one of the principal reasons for the Commission's decision in this case is to stimulate the grain trade so as to depart from this practice in the light of the Commission's findings that in-transit inspection is by no means essential.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="417.077" stopTime="418.861">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="417.077" offset="1771708">but it wasn't essential, as you just told me, under the old law?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_e_pollock" startTime="418.861" stopTime="559.787">
            <label>Mr. Earl E. Pollock</label>
            <text syncTime="418.861" offset="1778813">That's right, that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.812" offset="1786650">It could have been done the other way but it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.438" offset="1813086">The court below found with respect to this 1968 repeal that the primary purpose of the Congress was to affect an increased utilization of rail cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.451" offset="1869197">Nevertheless, in-transit inspections continued in very large numbers even after the repeal, amounting in 1969 to over or almost half a million inspections in just the western district alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.633" offset="1937951">Now faced with this situation and an increasingly critical car shortage, the western railroads responded by publishing the tariffs which are challenged in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.621" offset="1997824">These tariffs imposed essentially the same charge for the first in-transit inspection that previously applied to the second and subsequent inspections.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.767" offset="2050487">The tariffs of course apply only to grain shipments which are inspected while in-transit.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.472" offset="2077236">There is no charge if the shipment is inspected at origin or at destination after delivery or if inspection is avoided altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.488" offset="2121331">And before the Commission, the railroads even expressed the hope that they would not have to collect one single cent of these charges because the purpose was to avoid the inspections and not to raise revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.071" offset="2183607">The Commission summarized this decision of holding the charges in four chief findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.861" offset="2214849">First of all, the Commission found that because of the repeal in 1968 and because of other evidence in record, in-transit inspection is no longer essential to the orderly marketing of grain.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.276" offset="2276498">The Commission found instead that this service was entirely optional with shippers and their consignees, and that the basic responsibility of the railroads with respect to transportation does not require them to provide this service.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="559.787" stopTime="566.221">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="559.787" offset="2342536">Does the basic impetus Mr. Pollock for these inspections come from the consignee or the shipper?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_e_pollock" startTime="566.221" stopTime="910.695">
            <label>Mr. Earl E. Pollock</label>
            <text syncTime="566.221" offset="2368240">Primarily, the consignee and indeed primarily from the grain exchanges which are the principal plaintiffs in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.258" offset="2432397">Indeed there is a considerable economic advantage to these grain exchanges by virtue of the in-transit inspection of grain, since if the shipment is made to a particular point for the in-transit inspection, at that point the grain merchants in that particular area have in fact a captive market with respect to that grain shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.289" offset="2548485">The grain being there, it then becomes exceedingly difficult for reconsignment of that grain to a distant market or to a market which would require a back call on the transportation and indeed this is the -- it is this kind of dislocation, particularly among the grain dealers and the grain exchanges which has brought forth the principal opposition to these charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.323" offset="2688711">In other words, the Commission found that this service was purely an accessorial service, it was a special service and it was quite like a service, for example, that was needed for delivery of the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.806" offset="2746598">Second, the Commission sustained the reasonableness of the combination of the line-haul rate and these inspection charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.902" offset="2786931">The Commission pointed out that under the Terras, the aggregate charges could never exceed the maximum reasonable level determined by the Commission and the Commission reaffirm the vitality of the maximum level, pointing out that there was probably no segment of the country's railroad freight structure that had been reviewed more frequently and intimately than the one that has application to the movement of grain.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.774" offset="2922454">Third, the Commission found that the inspection charges themselves, are just and reasonable because they were less than the cost of the service to the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.368" offset="2968848">And fourth, the Commission found that the charges would materially increase car utilization and that elimination of in-transit inspection of grain would increase the number of available freight cars by several thousand annually.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.076" offset="3035721">The Commission retained jurisdiction to determine whether any funds derived from these charges should be used to upgrade the railroad freight car fleets and for this purpose, the Commission ordered the railroads to file periodic reports showing just what was the actual operation of these charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.726" offset="3126314">These reports dramatically confirm the effectiveness of these charges in reducing the volume of in-transit inspections.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.185" offset="3172080">They also serve to demonstrate, as the Commission found, the purely optional elective nature of the in-transit inspection service.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.100" offset="3219728">The report show that the frequency of such inspections before the charges became effective was nearly two-and-a-half times higher than the frequency afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.920" offset="3271032">Stated otherwise, there is already been, in the short time of these charges have been an effect, a 60% reduction and the frequency continues to decline because of the economic incentive which these charges provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.233" offset="3336338">The most recent report shows that there was only about one in-transit inspection for every five grain shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.534" offset="3385553">The Commission's findings were sustained by the District Court as supported by substantial evidence, but the court satisfied the Commission's order on the sole ground that the Commission did not adequately explain what the court viewed as a departure from an allegedly long-established Commission doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.618" offset="3497880">The court based this conclusion not on the Commission's findings, but instead on an expressly secondary reasons cited by the Commission for distinguishing a 1969 decision by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.031" offset="3587532">Entirely, on this very slim read, just four sentences taken out of a 43-page report, four sentences, constituting little more than a dictum, the court below held that the Commission had adopted what the court called an evidentiary rule which is discriminatory per se and that the Commission had thereby departed from its prior decisions which require consideration of the reasonableness of the aggregate charges in these service cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1140.587" offset="4665762">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.953" offset="4679137">As Mr. Pollock has stated, my argument this morning will be devoted to the second issue presented by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.183" offset="4712155">That is even assuming that the District Court correctly reversed the Commission's decision on the merits and remanded the case to the Commission for further proceedings did it nevertheless act beyond the scope of its power in ordering that that the rates themselves be suspended unless and until otherwise ordered by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.956" offset="4807241">On this issue, I am speaking on behalf of both the United States and the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.208" offset="4828244">It is our position that the order of the court was beyond the scope of its powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.993" offset="4855306">Mr. Pollock has already stated the facts related to the suspension issue and I will not repeat them in any detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.061" offset="4883623">Briefly these rates went into effect on May 4, 1971, and they remained in effect until the Commission had issued its original decision and during the entire pendency of this judicial review proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.420" offset="4949034">It was after a year later, in May of 1971 –1972, the District Court issued its opinion, reversing the Commission's decision and setting aside the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.150" offset="5003995">It is this portion of the order, that we believe is beyond the scope of the court's power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.357" offset="5028760">The solution of this issue turns on Section 15(7) of the Interstate Commerce Act as interpreted by this Court in 1963 in Arrow Transportation Company against Southern Railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.735" offset="5082363">Under Section 15, the right to initiate changes in their rates is essentially a matter for the managerial discretion of the carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.557" offset="5121651">The Commission is empowered to declare the rates unlawful only after full investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.941" offset="5147146">The only other limit upon the carrier's right to initiate changes in their rates is the provision of Section 15(7) which authorizes the Commission in its discretion to suspend the rates for a maximum period of seven months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.643" offset="5213915">The statute explicitly provides that if the proceeding has not been completed at the end of the seven month period, the rates “shall go into effect.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.115" offset="5259786">In the Arrow case, this Court was faced with a question of whether a District Court would have jurisdiction to itself suspend or enjoin the rates after the seventh month period had expired, but before the Commission had issued its original decision in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.893" offset="5330944">This Court held that it could not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.580" offset="5349648">It is stated at page 667 of its opinion that the intention of Congress in enacting Section 15(7) was to vest in the Commission, the sole and exclusive power to suspend and to withdraw from the judiciary any pre-existing power to grant injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.040" offset="5427493">The only difference between Arrow and this case is the stage at which the court has employed a judicial suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.065" offset="5459675">We do not believe that this is a sufficient difference toward a different result</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.807" offset="5478588">.In other words, we believe that the reasoning of Arrow applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.874" offset="5502830">In the first place, the basic Congressional policy of Section 15(7) as confirmed in Arrow is to allocate between the shippers and carriers, the risks and versions that are necessarily associated with any proposed rate change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.690" offset="5590183">Inevitably, a carrier proposing a change in its rates wishes to implement that proposal immediately, while the shippers on the other hand would prefer to delay it until the lawfulness of the rates has been finally determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.096" offset="5643786">The policy of Congress as adopted in Section 15(7) was essentially a compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.739" offset="5670327">It provided that during the first seven months, the risks and the burdens of a proposed rate change should be placed entirely on the carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.005" offset="5711391">That is, if the Commission chooses to suspend, the carrier cannot implement its rate change and if the rates are ultimately found to be lawful, the carrier has no remedy, it can never recover the lost remedies or the other lost benefits of that seven month period.</text>

            <text syncTime="1446.893" offset="5890905">What was on review was a final agency action, Your Honor, but this footnote does not apply for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.602" offset="5917759">In the first place, it was not issued pending judicial review, it was issued at the conclusion of the review proceeding, pending reconsideration of the case by the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.759" offset="5958405">Secondly, the suspension order entered here by the court did not preserve the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.368" offset="5980871">These rates have been in effect for over a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.866" offset="5990797">The effect of the court's order was to change the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.916" offset="6006993">So the suggestion of a limited power to maintain the status quo pending judicial review simply is not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.366" offset="6072822">We believe that the careful Congressional balancing of the risks and burdens of suspension which this Court held in Arrow, Congress intended to place on the carrier for the first seven months and upon the shippers thereafter, subject to the protection of a possible accounting and refund provision of a recollection suit applies equally when the case is pending before the Commission on remand, as when it was pending before the Commission in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.595" offset="6193716">In neither event has the lawfulness of the rates than finally determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.867" offset="6214823">And we believe that the Congressional policy is that once the seventh month period has expired, the carriers are entitled to place their rates into effect and to keep them in effect unless and until the rates are finally adjudged unlawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="1725.882" offset="7006856">Exactly, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.416" offset="7013021">It is other equitable powers to impose conditions for the protection of the shipments such as an accounting and refund provisions are not affected in anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.653" offset="7065997">In addition to the Congressional policy which I have mentioned that the carriers be permitted to put their rates into effect after seven months and keep them in effect unless and until they are found unlawful, we believe the Arrow decision cited two additional policy reasons for denying the court's power of judicial suspension which we believe are equally applicable when the case is pending before the Commission on remand as when it was pending in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.469" offset="7185220">In the first place, this Court pointed out that the exercise of a judicial suspension power would interfere with the primary jurisdiction of the agency and as I have just pointed out in answering Mr. Justice White's questions, the agency continues to have primary jurisdiction to determine the lawfulness of specific rates even though an error of law has been pointed out by the courts and the case remanded to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.112" offset="7291800">The actual determination of the lawfulness of the rates is still for the primary jurisdiction of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.407" offset="7316982">And the same nexus that this Court found in Arrow between primary jurisdiction and the suspension power applies here as in the situation that existed in Arrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.236" offset="7364315">Secondly this Court pointed out in Arrow that if the courts were permitted to suspend, the result might be different results to different shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.158" offset="7407992">The same situation could occur if the judicial suspension were permitted in connection with a remand because as this Court is aware, any number of suits can be brought to set aside the same Commission order in district courts all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.203" offset="7468178">If those courts should reach different results, one sustaining and the other reversing the Commission and if the reversing court were permitted to exercise a suspension power, then you would have the same type of different results to different shippers that this Court was concerned within Arrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.274" offset="7544456">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1872.955" offset="7595238">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.492" offset="7613315">I am representing here the Wichita Board of Trade and 37 other grain industry groups which comprise in effect the farmers in the Western United States, the country grain elevator operators in that part of the country, as well as the boards of trade on which grain is bought and sold and many of the grain companies which are the people who buy and sell the grain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.822" offset="7726686">First of all, this concept of inspection does not explain itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.440" offset="7749151">What we mean here by inspection is a grading of the grain in order to determine the quality of the grain and the value of the grain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.920" offset="7783006">Grain is susceptible to moisture, susceptible to contamination of farm material and kernel content and this type of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.830" offset="7818742">So that to know the other call out of grain does not tell you anything about what it is value is or whether it can be used for human food and things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.223" offset="7848312">So you have to get a grade in order to determine these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.413" offset="7869001">The practice over the years as these gentleman have told you and the young lady has been to take this grade at a marketplace such as Chicago or Kansas City or Omaha.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.532" offset="7913514">The cars come in there and the government employed samplers take the the sample of the grain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.123" offset="7935875">They write down to Board of Trade and it is inspected and analyzed by impartial government people and they say, this carload is number 2, yellow corn and it has so much moisture in it and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.270" offset="7980492">At that point, it becomes a salable commodity because we know what we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.157" offset="8004002">So that the reason why the grain has been inspected in transit has not been because of the Grain Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.825" offset="8026676">It has been because this is the place to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.783" offset="8038484">This is where the market is, this is the condition of a grain on a day that it is sold on a market and this is where the impartial inspection is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.845" offset="8070771">The change --</text>

            <text syncTime="1992.840" offset="8074742">If it is in transit, that suggested that it was originally destined somewhere beyond this market, does not it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel J. Sweeney</label>
            <text syncTime="1999.187" offset="8100133">No, it shipped to the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.861" offset="8106820">It will go from a country elevated to the market say to Omaha for instructions and re-consignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.941" offset="8131166">After the inspection is made then whoever buys the grains says well, ship it to Chicago or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.568" offset="8157602">You do not know who is going to buy the grain until it is inspected, that is the whole idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.327" offset="8180694">In other words, when you bring it to central grain exchange, they can bring that sample before the Board of Trade and people all over the country, all of the world can bid on that grain and in effect the farmers getting the benefit of this total market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.936" offset="8231163">The other way to go always for the farmer to ship his grain to Omaha to one of the handful -- maybe half a dozen elevators that are located there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.289" offset="8260524">He is at the mercy of those people, he has to sell to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.702" offset="8274213">The other way he can go now is to ship it in there and have it inspected and pay the $17, in which case he is paying $17 extra a car was something that he has always done and which is already paid for under the line haul rate itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2060.849" offset="8346728">Well, I think the alternative that many people have suggested is that if the railroads are really concerned about giving the shippers an incentive to eliminate the grain inspection, the thing for them to do would be to reduce their rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.081" offset="8403675">In other words, let us say the rate is $0.20 from a point in Nebraska at Omaha.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel J. Sweeney</label>
            <text syncTime="2087.995" offset="8455398">The carrier has no interest in the quality of grain, however, by providing a service which is of value, he is enhancing the attractiveness of the railroad service, but the point is that the carriers, when they made the $0.20 rate for example, they put into that rate $0.2 specifically because of the cost of the grain inspection, this was stipulated in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.043" offset="8535542">If the rate was not a full service rate, if the rate did not include the grain inspection, that rate would be $0.18.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.745" offset="8558320">So what I am saying to you is if they want to give them an incentive, let us do what they should do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.034" offset="8575457">They can not take away the service and continue the charge us the full $0.20.</text>

            <text syncTime="2314.668" offset="9362056">First of all, he is destroying the marketing structure which we have built up over 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.580" offset="9381700">He is putting a lot of people out of business that are involved in this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.217" offset="9396224">The second thing that he is doing is he is saying to us, I am going to take the service away from you and as I continue to charge you a rate which includes a specific cost of that service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.108" offset="9431855">We would have a much different case, if they were here saying, we took our rates and we took two cents off, we have published upper grades.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.568" offset="9457664">Now this is what has happened in the past, and that is why this case is at such cross roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.686" offset="9474069">In the past where the railroads wanted to put rates in without inspection, they have reduced their rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.815" offset="9498624">They have said we will drop from $0.20 to $0.18.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.445" offset="9509177">We will now give you an $0.18 rate which you can use without grain inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.085" offset="9527672">We will give you an incentive and this is what has happened and now all of a sudden, they have switched into this new position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.187" offset="9552123">They want to take away the grain inspection and they want to keep the higher rates which compensate them for it and they cannot have it both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.601" offset="9577827">If they want to go down this other road, if they want to come back next week, they can publish a new tariff and say, every rate in the West shall be $0.2 lower whenever a grain inspection is weighed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.267" offset="9620459">This is a way that they could have gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.360" offset="9628818">They could have avoided all these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.279" offset="9636446">They could have solved the car supply problem that they have been talking about that it said that they want, but they did not want to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.261" offset="9660374">They wanted to add a charge so that the man who takes the grain inspection has to pay for it once in the rate and secondly with the $17 and the man who was prevented from doing it because he says, I do not want to add another $17, he still pays the old rate which included the compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.309" offset="9728606">So that people that are using the inspection are being deprived because they're paying double, people who don't use the inspection are being deprived of the service that they're paying for right now today.</text>

            <text syncTime="2457.581" offset="9933720">I think if they were really sincere and all they wanted to do was get this goal of helping the car supply, they would come out with a very straightforward proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.005" offset="9967365">They would say we're going to knock two cents off every rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.527" offset="9977501">As of tomorrow, if you don't take your inspection, you're going to save two cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.168" offset="9992025">This is what I call an incentive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.517" offset="10001429">What they've been calling an incentive is actually a penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.686" offset="10010102">They're saying you're already paying for it once, tomorrow you're going to pay for it twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.276" offset="10024521">We can't go along with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.847" offset="10034761">Unfortunately, the Interstate Commerce Commission did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.290" offset="10048554">Now, we get to the question of why are the Interstate Commerce Commission decisions renewed at all by courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.613" offset="10069870">The reason is, because Congress put statutes and they said you can interpret these statutes and you can apply them to the facts, but you can't do it arbitrarily and that's exactly what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.021" offset="10115427">We have an arbitrary decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.963" offset="10123264">We have decision where the Commission was overwhelmed with all this evidence and repetitive testimony, all this legislative history from the Grain Standards Act about how important car supply is, and how this thing is going to help car supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.643" offset="10201945">So the commissioners are sitting there and they've got letters in their files, they've got complaints, they've got people criticizing them in the newspapers about the car supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.537" offset="10237471">Really, the problem is that the railroads just don't buy enough cars to replace the old ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.776" offset="10254503">In the last 15 years, they've dropped 300,000 box cars, they used to have over 600,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.295" offset="10276551">Now we've got 300,000 plus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.331" offset="10284701">So when they talk about a saving here, 300,000 cars a year or 600,000 cars a year, this is not the solution to the car shortage problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.962" offset="10319182">It's a small step in that direction, but it's not the great solution as presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.589" offset="10333706">So the Commission looked up and they said, well this is a car supply case, we're going to approve this thing and at that point they said we are not going to follow the statute and we're not going to look at this pile of evidence over here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.731" offset="10378324">We, at the Commission know well enough, what's good for the public, what's good for the railroad's car supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.929" offset="10399117">We don't have to look at statute then we have to look to the merits of the decision with this background, because this is really the background on which the Commission decided the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.275" offset="10448436">When the Commission came here, in a jurisdictional statement they specifically said to this Court that they were not going to ask the Court to review the merits of their decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.547" offset="10485530">Apparently at that time, when they first came here they were convinced that they couldn't defend their decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.810" offset="10506637">In the last few months something has happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.385" offset="10512906">They filed a brief and they're now trying to defend themselves on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.059" offset="10527640">I'm not going to question their right to do that, but I think it does show a little bit that there was certain lack of confidence in their own decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.435" offset="10561076">What do you have to prove in a case like this?</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.254" offset="10572361">You have to prove that the changes, in the rates and charges are just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.105" offset="10591796">This is Section 15(7) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.348" offset="10604753">Now one bar is on thing, when you have concepts of just and reasonable, it's somewhat vague and what is a just and reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.261" offset="10632443">Well, in this particular case, in this particular Act, Congress put in specific standards that the Commission shall consider in determining what is a just and reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.794" offset="10670582">The standards are in 15 (a) (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.419" offset="10685001">One thing is that they must show that the rates are at the lowest cost consistent with the total services and the other thing is, they have to show the effect on the movement of the traffic, whether or not the traffic would be diverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.424" offset="10749053">So the Commission then has to come to grips with the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.166" offset="10768071">More specifically within three months before these tariffs were published, the District Court in Ohio had affirmed a decision of the ICC in the transit charges case, which was the same kind of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.369" offset="10824808">The Southern Railroads decided that we've been providing transit on cotton for long time at the line haul rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.540" offset="10853543">We will now add a charge of something like $50 a car for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.088" offset="10867754">That case went before the ICC and the ICC decided, one you have got to present costs for the through movement, show us how much it cost to handle this traffic, how much your cost is for the transit and give us your total revenue and your total cost, otherwise we can't determine the overall reasonableness of your proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.153" offset="10944031">The other thing I said is that there would be a likelihood that you're going to lose lot of traffic to the trucks if you raise your rate like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.365" offset="10972871">That case went to the District Court in Ohio, and was affirmed by the District Court and then went to this Court and was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.090" offset="10999724">So here we're starting out and we're going to trial in this case and the railroads have got to prove these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.888" offset="11026892">Yet, they put in no evidence whatsoever on these issues and this is how the case comes to the Commission and they are sitting, trying to write a report which is going to find these rates just and reasonable when the railroads have put no evidence in on two issues that are spelled out by Section 15 (a) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.121" offset="11091884">Well, they had quite a job on the hand trying to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.849" offset="11102751">Here is how they went about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.739" offset="11110379">They said well, we don't have to follow the principles of the Southern Transit case, which incidentally are the statutory principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.263" offset="11140472">They said, this case is different from the Southern Transit case where we said you have to have total cost with the total movement and show us how much money you're making on this traffic before we're going to let you tack a charge on top of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.210" offset="11188224">So they said, well, in this case, we've got thousands of rates in a wide area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.293" offset="11212570">Where we've got a big job on our hands like this, well it's just too much to ask railroads to supply with cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.770" offset="11234408">We shouldn't have to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.283" offset="11240469">Well, of course, the Southern Transit case involved rates throughout the South and involved all the railroads and involved thousands of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.811" offset="11266591">So this distinction was I would say specious at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.265" offset="11288430">I don't know how stronger these people are defending that in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.194" offset="11300133">They talk about it as a dictum, they walk away, it's virtually a dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.856" offset="11314761">This Court many years ago in the (Inaudible) Divisions case said that there are means of meeting it when you've got thousands of rates involved, present typical evidence and there was some kind of a sample, show us representative rates and that's good enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.443" offset="11361155">This is how the business of the Commission is carried on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.007" offset="11371395">Everyday, all the day we've got cases involving thousands of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.182" offset="11384142">Nobody throws up their hands and says there is thousands of rates, they don't put any evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.945" offset="11399189">That's not true at all, where you've got thousands of rates, the justification and necessity for putting in these costs required by the statute is even greater, because there is more people affected by a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.030" offset="11443493">They could have broken this case into 50 different cases, let each railroad try their own case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.564" offset="11461674">It would be that much less rates in each one, but because they all come together and all simultaneously try to put this thing across.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.156" offset="11488005">It doesn't take out of the statute and leave him from the statutory burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.367" offset="11504828">The other way that Commission went on this point is they said, well, we find that way back in 1934 issued a decision on grain rates and in that case we looked very closely and we decided what a reasonable level of rate would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.087" offset="11563760">Now if we take those rates, and add to it, every single general increase we've had in the last 40 years, we will find that that total rate is still higher than what the shippers would get here if they add the $17 on top of the rates that they're paying today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.192" offset="11640142">What had happened is that the 1934 rates have become obsolete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.045" offset="11659577">They no longer move the grain traffic today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.434" offset="11669086">If these were the only rates that we have in the tariffs, the grain traffic wouldn't move by rail at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.219" offset="11688208">It would either be uneconomic or the barges and the trucks would get it on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.709" offset="11702209">There is no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.787" offset="11706493">These rates are as high as the sky.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.248" offset="11716315">So the Commission said, well, we've got that, and as long as the railroads haven't exceeded those rates, which their principle witness said, are paper rates don't move any traffic, as long as they don't like see those rates, we find that, this is alright.</text>

            <text syncTime="2991.222" offset="12068237">They have to know how much profit are the railroads making on these rates today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.909" offset="12082970">Can they afford to reduce the rate and give them a reduced scale of rates instead of adding something on top of them, on top of rates in many cases which are rather high.</text>

            <text syncTime="3005.726" offset="12126229">They try to walk away from the statute, or refine to an old decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.093" offset="12143783">Now if you stay with that for a moment, let's say they prescribed the rates of 1934, 10 cents, that rate today is say 25 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.112" offset="12175862">It's gone up 150%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.601" offset="12185788">There was never any prescription by the Commission that 25 cent rate is just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.550" offset="12205537">In order to bridge this tremendous leap from a 10 cent rate to a 25 cent rate, the Commission said, well, over the years those cases have gone up in this general increase cases and therefore every time we got any general increase case, this rate now becomes a new maximum reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.871" offset="12278888">Well, that isn't true at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3107.469" offset="12533217">I don't see how they could find it just and reasonable, they never looked at them, all they look at in those general increase cases is the total revenue need of the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.573" offset="12561638">So they need 5% more money and if they find that they do it, they'll give it to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.858" offset="12578774">I want to say just something on this Arrow case and we have here a special situation and all the talk about possible refunds gives us no help at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.332" offset="12620675">These people have put in a charge which they want to be a barrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.137" offset="12635930">They have come into this Court to say that since the charge went in, 50% of these inspections no longer take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.947" offset="12663202">So that on the shipments which they have precluded, nobody is going to get a refund of $17 a car on a shipment that wasn't inspected because the charge was so high that nobody could use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.875" offset="12702908">On the other 50% what happened to the charge is that it was passed onto the farmer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.033" offset="12727463">When the purchase was made from the farmer they deduct the freight rate and the $17 a car, that's taken right away from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.936" offset="12759124">He is not a party to the transportation with the railroad, he has nothing to do with the shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.273" offset="12776469">He will never get that $17 back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.436" offset="12785142">Everyday that this case goes on without restoring the District Court's decree, the farmer is loosing $17 on every car that is inspected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.008" offset="12827355">The other way he loses is that he is losing his market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.253" offset="12836342">He can't get this nationwide market that we have been providing him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.732" offset="12850343">So we have people going out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.713" offset="12858180">We have grain inspectors that have been fired, we have this whole system of marketing through grain inspection which is being gradually destroyed and taken apart while the litigation goes forward and the railroads understandably and the ICC, not quite so understandably say that no one can do anything about it and they rely upon Arrow case which said that we don't want single judge courts doing a job before the ICC decision which can only be done by three-judge courts under the statute after an ICC decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.131" offset="12991927">We summit that the railroads lose a case, they can go to court get the Commission set aside and then they can put their rates in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.392" offset="13028916">On the other hand, the shipper should have the same power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.273" offset="13044485">They should have the same right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.372" offset="13048874">They shouldn't be just going to court to touch bases and to go back to the ICC again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.876" offset="13070921">They should be able to get some substantial relief while the case was back to the ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.825" offset="13090670">Bearing in mind particularly that it isn't necessary for the Court to say this is just and reasonable or it's not just and reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3283.502" offset="13237373">At that point as it was noted in the footnote the case belongs to the three judge courts, it's up to them to decide and it's up to them to decide whether the situation is such that they have to grant some kind of ancillary relief and we asked that court to grant us ancillary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.475" offset="13297246">We didn't have some grant, the specific relief that they did, but we asked them to order the ICC on remand to immediately have this rates canceled.</text>

            <text syncTime="3378.413" offset="13616985">The railroads had failed to meet the burden of proof and all of the District Court was saying is since you've failed to meet your burden of proof in a case in which you had ample of time to do so, as of this date you have no further right to keep those rates in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.395" offset="13668916">Without prejudice to down the road perhaps the ICC will give them another hearing, perhaps some decisions, some valid decisions will be issued some day that will approve this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.132" offset="13703920">But in the mean time, the life of these rates as of September 1971, when the ICC issued it's decision, was critically dependent upon whether or not the ICC found that they had fulfilled their burden of proof and if they didn't fulfill the burden of proof as of the next day, they have no right to be in effect and the court is in effect saying you made a mistake, you didn't follow the law and therefore these rates have to go out, until such time as you fulfill your obligation and prove that they are just and reasonable.</text>

            <label>Mr. William A. Imhof</label>
            <text syncTime="3443.736" offset="13878314">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.894" offset="13890957">My name is Imhof, I represent the secretary of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.550" offset="13909556">The secretary is represented here today because both of the issues principally before the Court today are of vital concern to farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.873" offset="13938813">Farmers after all are the fellows who are bearing this charge that we have been fighting about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.700" offset="13958144">The grain farmer in the West sells his grain to a country elevator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.954" offset="13975176">He receives the price that day at Minneapolis or Chicago less the cost of getting it there by railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.933" offset="13999104">Historically, line-haul rate included a stop for inspection which facilitated that the sell of the grain at the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.975" offset="14031287">Now the railroads have added a penalty charge over and above the line-haul rates for the inspection and that penalty charge too is deducted from the price the farmer receives for his grain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.060" offset="14079561">And this burden is especially better for the farmer because he knows and indeed our friends, the railroads conceded at the hearing below, that they were already collecting for this inspection charge out of the line-haul rate and therefore the new inspection charge from a revenue standpoint for the railroads is largely gravy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.139" offset="14155943">However, we are more greatly concerned and I will confine my remarks to appellant's attack upon the equitable jurisdiction of District Courts, upon review of ICC orders and this issue is of concern not only to grain farmers but to farmers generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.186" offset="14220100">Farmers rely heavily upon rail transportation for both transportation of their produce and also for their supplies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.886" offset="14250924">Their livelihood, sometimes even their economic survival depends on having available rail transportation at reasonable rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.412" offset="14284988">Of course, what is their first line of defense against unreasonable rates?</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.634" offset="14297945">It's the Commission, but if the Commission makes a mistake, if it approves a railroad proposed charge on less than requisite amount of substantial evidence, where should they go?</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.591" offset="14345697">Until recently, it seemed clear enough that a shipper could bring suit in a three-judge District Court which if it sustained his charges about the Commission's failure, could enjoin collection of the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.867" offset="14402853">This was the view of the Alabama District Court and of the Fifth Circuit whose judgments you affirmed in the case in Arrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.713" offset="14434200">In this case of course, it was the view of the District Court in Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.261" offset="14452381">We belief it was also the District Court -- the view of the District Courts in California in the Cantley case, and in the District of Columbia in the Ad Hoc Committee on Consumer Protection case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.438" offset="14493132">I think we might note in passing that it was also the view of the Illinois District Court in the Inland Waterways case which was relied upon by the railroads, this Court reversed the District Court in that case but didn't question the exercise of equitable jurisdiction by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.680" offset="14558124">I think the District Court in that case did go too far and foreclosed the discretion of the agency on remand and that was the reason that it was overturned by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.744" offset="14598353">Just over two years ago, however, a District Court, three-judge District Court in New York declined to enjoin collection of Commission approved rates on the ground that the theory of the decision of this Court in Arrow logically extended foreclosed such relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.974" offset="14659271">The small shipment decision was of course pressed upon the Kansas Court in this case, but the Kansas Court declined to alter its judgment and indeed refused to stay of its judgment especially because the farmer who was bearing this inspection charge, can be protected only if collection of the charge is enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.599" offset="14733772">The appellants argue that the injunction issue is controlled by Arrow and that under Section 15(7) of the Interstate Commerce Act, only the Commission can suspend the railroad rate and then only for the statutory period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.054" offset="14791555">However they overlook the fact that the suspension provision in Section 15(7) is confined by its own terms to the period prior to Commission decision and they also overlook the fact that in Arrow, both this Court and the lower courts were careful to confine their holdings to the situation presented, that is where the Commission had not yet completed its investigation or issued an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.907" offset="14879013">While both the District Court and the Court of Appeals in Arrow denied the availability of injunctive relief at that stage, both concluded that after final order by the Commission approving railroad rates, the three-judge court upon review of that order has the power to enjoin the effect in the rates, in affirming those judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.575" offset="14961664">This court also pointed out that judicial cognizance of the reasonableness of rates is confined to review by a three-Judge court of the ICC order, it can't take place before that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.319" offset="15016626">We submit that therefore upon a fair reading Arrow lends no support to appellant's arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.908" offset="15038986">This is not simply our conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.703" offset="15046196">We would refer Your Honors to the decision of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals which is referred to in the decision in ad hoc committee on consumer protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.701" offset="15082141">We note also that in that case, the Court held injunctive relief to be available not withstanding that there was a possibility of a motion for reconsideration before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.878" offset="15126862">The dichotomy drawn by the courts in Arrow and Ad Hoc between the judicial roll before and after decision by the Commission approving rates is entirely consistent with the statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.954" offset="15171166">The Congress provided for two situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.161" offset="15184018">The Arrow case dealt with of them and that was shippers resorting to injunction prior to Commission decision and they amended 15(7) to provide for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.151" offset="15215992">But in this case we are not talking about 15(7), we are talking about the urgent deficiencies act which Congress provided especially for judicial review of Commission orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.064" offset="15255594">It created a commerce court and transferred the jurisdiction of that court in turn to the district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.405" offset="15273044">It had no intention at anytime of restricting the equitable powers of the circuit courts or the commerce court in making those transfers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.953" offset="15319228">I think I would like to address a couple of specific points which have been of interest to the Justices in the arguments presented heretofore this morning.</text>

            <text syncTime="3872.411" offset="15592991">I think if you logically extend the Commission's argument to its fullest length you are reviving the negative order doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="3889.624" offset="15661850">Of course, then injunctive relief was not available because the court never even got jurisdiction over the order.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="4044.527" offset="16281475">Thank you Mr. Imhof.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_e_pollock" startTime="4051.569" stopTime="4307.568">
            <label>Mr. Earl E. Pollock</label>
            <text syncTime="4051.569" offset="16309687">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.930" offset="16319091">May I first of all point out that much of the argument made by the appellees here bears no relationship either to the findings made by the Commission which I comment to Your Honors, or to the proceeding that was conducted before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4070.872" offset="16386905">For example, Mr. Sweeney's principle argument here concerning the necessity of a cost analysis under section 15 (a) (2) was never raised before the Commission and of course, under this Court's decision in Tucker and in other cases is barred, but more fundamentally, the appellee's arguments and I think this gets perhaps to crux of it failed to take account of the nature of the rate making function and the Commission's role and discretion in performing that function.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.706" offset="16506232">When it comes to carrier made rates there is contrary to the appellee's suggestion no single rate which is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4110.228" offset="16544266">There is instead a zone of reasonableness and this zone is located between a reasonable maximum and a reasonable minimum, and the carrier is free under repeated decisions of this Court, without a special permission from the Commission to adjust its rates as well as those rates stay within the zone of reasonableness and do not violate the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4135.005" offset="16643427">Now what could the Commission do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.214" offset="16652204">On the basis of its own prior decisions and its particularized attention year after year after year, decision after decision after decision, the Commission reaffirmed the vitality of the current maximum reasonable level and said across even if we add, even if we were to add these inspection charges to the existing line-haul rates, the resulting combination would still not exceed the zone of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.524" offset="16777488">Further more, and in particular relation to Mr. Justice White's earlier question, I think it is important to recognize that under the statutory scheme, carrier initiated rates are valid unless set aside by the Interstate Commerce Commission and not vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="4188.596" offset="16857736">In other words, under the statutory scheme, a carrier need not get permission to institute rates, instead the carrier has that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4199.601" offset="16901726">Congress gave the carrier that right subject only to the Commission power to suspend the rates for this limited period of seven months and it was on that basis that this Court in Arrow said that that is the only exception made by Congress and neither the Commission nor courts can intervene beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4221.335" offset="16988662">With respect to the optional nature of the inspection, Mr. Sweeney has said that this is absolutely essential but look at the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4229.040" offset="17019486">At the present time, only one inspection is made for every five shipments certainly indicating that it is not essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="4238.389" offset="17056893">Further more in-transit inspection has never taken place, as the Commission pointed out on Page 15 of the Appendix, with respect to all large traffic carrying grain, all truck traffic carrying grain and now 80 % of the shipments go without -- by rail, go without any in-transit inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4259.808" offset="17142575">It is for the Commission to determine whether this is a necessity and the Commission found -- Pages 56 and Pages 17 through 90 of the Appendix that it was not essential and certainly, this is not the form to re-argue the nitty-gritty of rate making issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="4278.419" offset="17217076">If there is anything which is committed to the discretion of Interstate Commerce Commission, it is this matter of determining what constitutes a reasonable rate under established principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4292.987" offset="17275277">It is also instructive, I would say is closing that although both appellees now argue for the necessity of the suspension power in courts, they do not even see fit to request such relief in the District Court.</text>
