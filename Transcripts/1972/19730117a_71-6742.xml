            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We’ll hear arguments next in Hurtado against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.836" offset="330689">Mr. Armendariz.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="albert_armendariz_sr" startTime="57.368" stopTime="585.388">
            <label>Mr. Albert Armendariz, Sr.</label>
            <text syncTime="57.368" offset="332884">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, how are you, gentlemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.418" offset="365066">The case that we are going to consider today gentlemen arises out of a right that the United States Government and for that matter, state Government have in securing the services of the witnesses in case in which the Federal Government and the states are, this involves Federal Government only, but in general, the states are interested in having.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.460" offset="497246">In other words, witnesses for the state, witnesses for the United States Government and in the process of securing these witnesses the Congress has passed Rule 46 (b) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure which authorizes the incarceration of these witnesses during the pretrial procedure to guarantee that they will be there and should they not be able to make bond and that they will be there to testify during the proceedings involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.865" offset="670804">Then, we have in conjunction with this, and by the way, I might say here that there are other ways that a witness maybe detained such as an example of the mafia or a mafia witness who is -- who the Federal Government that fears maybe killed maybe detained in.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.920" offset="771009">So there are other ways of detention other than through 46 (b), but then we have an article which is found in the law regarding the payment of these witnesses and this is the statute which is in question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.161" offset="860035">The main issue here as I see it is the interpretation of 1821 regarding the payment of witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.429" offset="897128">This is the main issue and the main issue arises because of course in the -- if it is interpreted in a certain way then of course the constitutional issues can be reached, but the main issue arises because we have a statute which is in three pieces, it is a tripod, the statute is in three pieces or three sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.841" offset="1022725">The first section is that no person shall be held to, excuse me, I think I'm reading -- the first section involves the payment of a per diem, a per diem to all witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.812" offset="1102660">Now, the second section involves itself with the payment of that part of the money that a person or a witness would spend in hotel and eating or sustenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.943" offset="1171101">And then the statute in its evolvement has a last section which refers to incarcerated witnesses and states that such witnesses will receive $1.00 a day compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.983" offset="1231287">The interpretation of the statute is really the important thing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.473" offset="1261275">I think that we have a very similar case in the way that the Court should proceed as the Dandridge case and that is -- that is that the interpretation of the statute is of first consideration because if the interpretation is -- that is $20.00 a day then we don’t reach the constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.560" offset="1353644">Now, it’s important then to look very carefully at the words of the statute and to look to the rules of interpretation of statutes and this is of course what we feel has -- has not been done by the Court’s below.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.812" offset="1438595">First, you must look at the fact that the very first section refers to a per diem, it calls it a per diem.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.096" offset="1491780">Now, this is of course a daily payment and if we look at the statute itself, and we look at the intention of Congress in all of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.051" offset="1571610">We are faced as lawyers and as judges with this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.372" offset="1592822">We must recognize that Congress in its scheme of things has provided for payment, for services, for all Court attachés.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.968" offset="1647261">It has provided for payment to each one of you as judges of the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.265" offset="1676413">It has provided for payment for we lawyers who might be asked to participate in the defense of a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.952" offset="1727195">Congress has provided for payment for the bailiffs, for the janitor of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.661" offset="1758020">And Congress has provided likewise for the payment of witnesses, $20.00 per day.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.390" offset="1796890">Now, must Congress say that in that first section that a per diem shall be paid to witnesses, including those incarcerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.540" offset="1881527">This is what the Fifth Circuit seems to think, but that’s not the rule of interpretation of statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.230" offset="1908276">Now, look at the second section that we have here gentlemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.135" offset="1919875">The second section excludes salaried employees of the Government from the $16.00 payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.686" offset="1966164">Now there's rational there.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.041" offset="1975568">The rational is that salaried employees of the Government receive money from the Government to pay their daily expenses, their hotel.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.784" offset="2022484">It excludes the witnesses in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.539" offset="2041501">This is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.136" offset="2047875">It excludes them from the $16.00 specifically because they are having their room and board paid for by in the local pool keep.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.774" offset="2086431">It excludes witnesses who reside near the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.281" offset="2104508">This is also reasonable because if you live near the Court, you go home and you eat at home.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.052" offset="2123630">You don’t need pay a hotel bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.240" offset="2136377">Now, the second section excludes those that Congress intended to exclude it, means that the first section doesn’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.357" offset="2164799">The first section says, “All witnesses.”</text>
            <text syncTime="521.155" offset="2187995">Now, we come then to of course the work or the term “attending court” and this is where the Fifth Circuit has stated that, a witness in jail is not attending Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.997" offset="2263333">They seem to – they seem to say, I mean they say, although they -- they don’t quote a case to us that this is a stage of the proceeding, but we’re not dealing with semantics and words.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.841" offset="2330728">We’re dealing with fairness and equality and we are dealing with the interpretation of a statute of Congress in which we should not attribute to Congress such a – such a disposition to give to one witness who is free, who is in a hotel, enjoying himself $20.00 a day while he waits and the person who is placed in jail, give him $1.00 a day while he waits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1070.745" offset="4386356">This is a troublesome case and it is good I think that the problem has been brought to light.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.633" offset="4421883">Whether there is anything that this Court can properly or should do about it is and not so clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.301" offset="4464619">In the first place, it seems to me important to put before the Court what I conceive to be the basis of the jurisdiction of the District Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.637" offset="4525955">There is in the appendix, the original complaint beginning on page 4 of the appendix and there is also a first amended complaint beginning on page 28 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.691" offset="4606098">It isn’t wholly clear to me which one is actually the one upon which the District Court acted, but I would assume that the first amended complaint is the one which is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.237" offset="4672345">The United States is the sole defendant named in this complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.634" offset="4697945">There is no officer of the United States, no Marshal, and no United States Attorney, and no Cabinet Officer, and no one, but the United States is named as a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.775" offset="4758444">If you look at the complaint, paragraph two it says, “That this suit seeks to enjoin the enforcement of a federal statute to Title 28 U.S.C. 1821 and it requests a three-judge court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.765" offset="4834408">And then if you look at paragraph three, you will find that it is alleged that there is a case of actual controversy and there is a reference to the declaratory judgment statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.225" offset="4892296">Now, I think it is perfectly clear that Congress has never consented to a suit by citizen or an alien against the United States to enjoin the United States from anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.857" offset="4946840">It may have in some special Acts, but it has not in any statute which is applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.296" offset="4972544">And similarly, I think that sovereign immunity is a barrier to a suit for a declaratory judgment against the United States unless the case is in some other way brought within the jurisdiction of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.924" offset="5051120">When we examined the statutes which relate to the jurisdiction of the District Court, the only one which can have any application here --</text>

            <text syncTime="2530.479" offset="10225246">Now, let me say as I indicated in our brief in our position that I have tried to do a little good in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.353" offset="10272789">I have called it to the attention of the Deputy Attorney General and of the Attorney General and it has proceeded this far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.722" offset="10314271">That on January 10, 1973, the Attorney General sent a letter addressed to the Speaker, a corresponding letter to the Vice President, but the letter has not yet been sent to this Speaker or to the Vice President.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.652" offset="10390026">The form I have has a big rubber stamp on it to budget for clearance not sent to Congress and under the form, there has to be clearance from the office of management and budget the last paragraph of the letter says, “The office of management and budget has advised that enactment of this legislation is consistent with the objectives of this administration.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.740" offset="10486366">Now, when clearance is obtained from the office of management and budget and my influence is that office is not always very great, but the Attorney General has recommended it to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.405" offset="10553031">If it is obtained then this proposal will be sent to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.404" offset="10576959">The proposal as is indicated raises the $1.00 per day in both places, that is both in Section 1821 and in the immigration provision to $20.00 per day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.975" offset="10635264">It also takes advantage of the opportunity to make a change in the provision with respect to transportation cost for ordinary witnesses where the statute now provides that it should be first class and the suggestion is made that in modern times the economy class airfare is adequate and they are doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.204" offset="10716139">However, I am told that this will be simply a means of putting it before Congress if it gets before Congress and that the department may well not support the full $20.00 a day and there is a really real problem here which needs to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.347" offset="10788760">$20.00 a day for 30 days in a month is $600.00 a month and in this particular area of Mexico, 70% of the people have an income of less than $80.00 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.223" offset="10848214">And there is great concern that if we provide a build in way to make $600.00 a month by illegally entering the United States and being detained as a witness that the number of people who do this maybe very greatly increased.</text>

            <text syncTime="2712.020" offset="10951450">But, if that is works out to be eight times as much as you can make working in the fields in Mexico, it may look pretty good and the suggestion has been made that if this does come before Congress that representatives of the department will recommend that there be added a proviso to this effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.911" offset="11042983">This wording is not final, but it explains the idea provided that any alien who has entered the country illegally and who is held not more than 30 days as a material witness in a case involving the illegal entrance of himself or another or any violation of the immigration law shall receive only $5.00 per day for such period of incarceration when not attending in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.203" offset="11152175">And this I mention, because it seems to me to emphasize the fact that this is a problem which ought not to be resolved in some kind of rigid constitutional terms that the equal protection clause requires that everybody be treated the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.089" offset="11223751">That it obviously has practical connotations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.494" offset="11245380">This is not just a mechanical thing, but the protection of our borders against the introduction of illegal immigrants who compete for jobs against American citizens in areas where jobs are not readily available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.262" offset="11320404">It is a legitimate matter of American policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.267" offset="11336391">It is a matter which can appropriately receive the attention and consideration of Congress and which seems to me in a proper allocation of function should be determined in detail by the Congress and not by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.693" offset="11406190">Now, it is very appropriate I think that the issue has been raised and that steps are being taken so that it will be put before Congress for active consideration there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.630" offset="11461883">I would think that the ultimate resolution of the problem would be better in the hands of Congress then by any solution which it seems to me this Court can make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.834" offset="11526666">This Court cannot spell out a detailed statute which will say, “Well in case of illegal immigrants and so on.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.982" offset="11555297">The only analogy that has been suggested for proceeding by this Court is in terms of some equal protection idea which idea I think is not relevant here in the fact of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.640" offset="11621961">Accordingly, we would submit that the judgment below should be affirmed.</text>
