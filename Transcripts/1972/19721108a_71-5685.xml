            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We’ll hear arguments first in 71-5685, Daisy Johnson against New York State Education Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.517" offset="161416">Mr. Nathanson you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carl Jay Nathanson</label>
            <text syncTime="17.203" offset="172178">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.810" offset="186598">Education has long been a regarded as perhaps the most important function about state and local government.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.662" offset="213974">It’s recognized as fundamental and preservative of the democratic societies.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.844" offset="234768">Education truly prepares the individual for meaning -- meaningful participation in society, economically, socially, politically, and intellectually.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.655" offset="278026">New York State like most states in the United States conceived education of such fundamental importance about the individual and society that it compels minors to attend upon compulsory instruction for a period of 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.677" offset="342079">It’s against this background that the issue presented in this Court must be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.525" offset="365484">New York’s public school system continues to rely extensively upon textbooks as the basic core for their curriculum.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.670" offset="398085">It remains that fundamental tool in the education of all young students of public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.933" offset="423058">The question presented in this Court is whether the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids New York State from denying indigent school children, textbook essential for the required instruction solely because of the inability of their parents to pay textbook rental fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.279" offset="500485">In all but six of New York 756 school districts, the statutory scheme for providing textbooks is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.424" offset="541027">With respect to students in grades seven to 12, the Education law requires that textbooks be provided free of charge to all students in both the public and the private schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.448" offset="589197">With respect to students in grades one to six in the public schools, the legislative scheme provides that the authorized voters of a school district may vote a tax for the purchase and loan of textbooks free of charge to all students in grades one to six.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.916" offset="655026">However, in the absence of such budget approval and such approval of a tax for that purpose, the local school districts are required to either rent or sell textbooks to all children in grade one to six.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.309" offset="712600">In June and July of 1970, the voters of the West Hempstead Public School District defeated a budget and a tax for the purchase of textbooks and the distribution of textbooks free to children in grades one to six.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.194" offset="772159">Consequently, the local school district notified all parents of children in grades one to six that they would have to pay a textbook rental fee as a condition to their children obtaining textbooks.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="177.784" offset="814477">Now, what’s the situation today?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carl_jay_nathanson" startTime="180.335" stopTime="192.167">
            <label>Mr. Carl Jay Nathanson</label>
            <text syncTime="180.335" offset="824717">Well, Mr. Chief Justice, in subsequent to the granting of the certiorari in this case, the school district did in fact approve a school budget and a tax for the purchase of textbooks.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="192.167" stopTime="196.344">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="192.167" offset="872051">So that all these students’ grades one to six are now receiving books, are they?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carl_jay_nathanson" startTime="196.344" stopTime="233.611">
            <label>Mr. Carl Jay Nathanson</label>
            <text syncTime="196.344" offset="888769">All students in the elementary school are now receiving books.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.241" offset="900368">However, the local school district is under an obligation under New York State law to hold annual budget referendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.231" offset="928266">The preceding history of the pattern of voting in this district where six out of seven school budgets have been defeated -- the fact that they are -- these local school board admits that absent approval of this tax, they are mandated to rent or sell textbook to local -- to the students in the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.841" offset="1002768">I think based upon whether or not this case is moot or presents a justiciable controversy and I will cover that further subsequently in the argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="233.611" stopTime="235.051">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>

            <label>Mr. Carl Jay Nathanson</label>
            <text syncTime="235.051" offset="1043623">The petitioners in this case are parents of children in the elementary school grades.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.121" offset="1063894">They were notified, received letters; the record bears it out prior to the commencement of the school term that no textbook would be provided to children unless their parents pay the textbook rental fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.464" offset="1113213">Petitioners are also recipients of public assistance in New York State and were unable to pay -- were unable to pay the textbook rental fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.762" offset="1142471">That factor is uncontroverted by the record and there’s no question of indigency.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="264.515" offset="1161383">Isn’t there something in the record however that part of their payments are for educational purposes?</text>

            <label>Mr. Carl Jay Nathanson</label>
            <text syncTime="272.525" offset="1193462">Yes, the -- with respect to that question, New York State in 1971 reduced the level of benefits for public assistance from 100% of need to 90% of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.189" offset="1244139">At the present time, recipients only receive 90% to what the state has determined to be the minimum need for sustenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.875" offset="1266918">So there’s no question that even assuming there was a minimal allowance in the budget for education, the very fact that they reduced the budget by that 10% deprives the recipients of any opportunity to purchase the textbooks.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.928" offset="1359078">Yes sir, the education increment is used for other items aside from textbooks will be used for purchase of sneakers for gymnasium classes, will be used for purchase of gym suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.163" offset="1407979">It would cover all items related to educational needs.</text>

            <text syncTime="354.389" offset="1520933">I have contacted the attorney who argued the case before the court and held the Rosado case.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.816" offset="1546637">I was informed by that attorney that the school -- the allowance is intended to cover all these other items and not intended to cover textbooks.</text>

            <text syncTime="389.436" offset="1661158">The superintendent of the school district although compassionate with the plight of the children indicated that he was obliged under state law to exact the textbook rental fee as a condition to furnishing textbooks.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.654" offset="1705984">The recipients also contacted to the state and local welfare agency and requested an allowance to cover the textbook rental fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.881" offset="1738898">They were informed that New York State when it went on to the flat grant system, eliminate all special grants and any opportunity to provide for this type of expenditure.</text>

            <text syncTime="486.537" offset="2049546">I might point out that the local school board in the matter as it appeared in the lower court conceded that there were in fact other recipients in the school district who were similarly affected by this legislative scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="1653.493" offset="6717315">I fail to see how they maximize impact of the textbooks by denying textbooks to those who perhaps need it most.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.618" offset="6745840">It would seem that a less onerous alternative would be to deny textbooks to children in grades one to 12 who are able to pay the textbook rental fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.533" offset="6777501">In that case, all children will be able to obtain textbooks in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.178" offset="6808116">I think this case is also parallels the Hopper case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.238" offset="6820342">In Hopper too, there was no federal constitutional right to vote in the state election.</text>

            <text syncTime="1880.610" offset="7625853">Yes, I would.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.002" offset="7631391">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.968" offset="7643199">I would initially very like analyze these two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.304" offset="7660544">I'm trying to place this case if I may in its proper perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.531" offset="7681546">The two statutes are Section 701 of the New York Education Law and that deals with the provision the furnishing textbooks from grade seven through 12 and which allows the local school board to pay up to $10 per book, per child for the school year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.613" offset="7765870">That’s $10, that the outside limit they may spend in grade seven through 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.655" offset="7786036">Section 703 dealing with the primary grades one through six speaks some terms of qualified voters of any school district may vote of tax for textbooks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.617" offset="7825847">If they do not, if they are under the austerity program, then they may charge a rental fee per year of $7.50 per child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.489" offset="7861373">Now, this provision under 703 does not implicate the heavy areas -- the urban areas in New York State because of provisions there do allow the local school boards to provide textbooks without a referendum and authorize them and so to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.883" offset="7942875">It’s note worthy as well that in these large urban areas, New York City and we have set them forth which they are Buffalo and Rochester, Syracuse and Yonkers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.480" offset="7989269">Its note worthy that these are concentrated areas of welfares.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.353" offset="8004733">So that’s it’s not quite justified on the part of the petitioners here to claim that State of New York is discriminating against indigent welfare recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.331" offset="8048724">As a matter of fact, large percentage of the welfare recipients do reside in these urban areas and all beneficiaries of the state’s statutes that do permit school textbooks to be distributed without any charge of rental fee.</text>

            <text syncTime="2004.725" offset="8122284">Yes, they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.591" offset="8133778">I’m just -- If I may Justice Marshall, I’m simply trying to place this case in its perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.706" offset="8158229">I think it’s getting a little out of hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.551" offset="8177560">Now, the $7.50 rental fee per year in grades one through six can actually be deemed a reasonable rate in light of the $10 limit that supplied in grade seven through 12 under Section 701.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.290" offset="8244537">And because of declaration of policy in State of New York with regard to grade seven through 12 is that because of the added cost of the textbooks and the technical nature of the textbooks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.451" offset="8289155">This heavy burden should not be passed on to any of the children and the State has formulated that declaration of policy in that statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.632" offset="8329906">Now, the $7.50 figure is a reasonable rate when we look at the $10 rate in Section 701.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.976" offset="8359267">Now, in New York State prior to this Court’s decision of Rosado against Wyman, there were special need grants for AFDC or Aid for Dependent Children recipients included.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.859" offset="8422797">There was included an item for textbooks in these special need grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.938" offset="8439097">This Court in Rosado determined that the State of New York may not sole proceed with specialty grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.688" offset="8470131">There must a flat general grant and following this Court’s dictates, New York Social Services Law was amended to reach so that Section 131-a does eliminate all special grants excluding rent in fuel, but includes textbooks and related education expenses under the general grant and the record shows and it is just been conceded by the petitioners in this case that when the Rosado case was remanded to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.933" offset="8587055">The District Court determined that approximately $3 is included in the monthly grant for all educational expenses for the family of four.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.107" offset="8619760">So that amounts to $36 a year per family of four.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.139" offset="8635956">Assuming that the 10% reduction goes -- is involved here then that would be $32.40 per year for educational expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.258" offset="8684440">Now, we’ve just noted that the rental fee is $7.50.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.085" offset="8707741">So that it is note worthy that it is not unjustifiable rental fee and that these plaintiffs -- these petitioners can afford this assuming that they budget the welfare grants properly.</text>
