            <text syncTime="20.490" offset="185344">This case involves the first assertion in this Court that an individual Indian citizen may engage in a private commercial venture literally, any private commercial venture in direct competition with other citizens of the state or for that matter even with other Indians so unfortunate as to have been declared competent or to have moved off the reservation with paying or collecting any of the excise taxes applicable to all such businesses on an equal basis conducted by other citizens of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.434" offset="365066">It involves a claim of a right literally to destroy those other competing businesses, a claim, which is asserted again by a citizen entitled by the Constitution to every right and privilege extended by the state to every other citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.507" offset="449390">The factual setting and which this claim arrives is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.277" offset="468511">The Colville Reservation is not an isolated track in the State of Washington occupied only by Indians.</text>

            <text syncTime="227.400" offset="1013008">Most of which have probably been sold to non-Indians, but even if they are still retained by Indians, those yellows lands on the reservation do not support the peculiar claims for their owners, which the appellant makes here for his land.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.132" offset="1083852">Which is still restricted as far as alienation and taxation is concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="343.766" offset="1478405">Where the -- where Wapato and Toppenish of that area is mostly patented land.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.789" offset="1502542">Though, again there is a mixture as there is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.909" offset="1511006">There’s land retained by Indians even down there.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.399" offset="1532949">Moreover, there’s one other point, far from all of the Indians on the Colville -- in the Colville tribe live on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.797" offset="1566595">The record in this case indicates that between half and three quarters of them leave off the reservation add to that number, those Indians living on patented lands on the reservation and it’s clear that the extraordinary privileges claimed by appellant are likely to be available only to a capriciously fortunate minority of Colville or other Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.342" offset="1668786">And it’s this integration in these reservations, which gives rise to the importance of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.601" offset="1697729">Indeed, I think to its very existence and presence before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.403" offset="1716955">It’s this integration, I believe, which accounts for the fact that until a last-ditch effort to show up appellant’s claim to tax exemption last spring.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.136" offset="1759901">The Federal Indian Trader Act was simply unused in the State of Washington except on two isolated coastal reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.230" offset="1792293">They were all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.472" offset="1797308">They shop in the same store as whether they were Indian or non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.189" offset="1816116">Now, the approach of Congress to Indian tax exemptions has been to set out post exemptions explicitly by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.051" offset="1851538">Mr. Cohen’s Treaties are written for that Bureau of Indian Affairs, which was quoted here yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.295" offset="1872541">It says, “Indeed, such exemptions as apply to specific federal or state taxes on the income of Indians or on their property must be found then or derived from statutes and treaties or agreements with the Indian tribes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="459.111" offset="1939832">The approach of this Court for many years has been identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.337" offset="1956760">It has based successful exemption claims only on specific acts of Congress and not since the demise of implied governmental immunity 34 years ago in the Helvering case on general philosophical concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.382" offset="2020916">Now, appellants first and chief claim to a statutory exemption is based on the Indian Trader Act and this Court’s decision in Warren Trading Post.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.734" offset="2066265">The exemption, which this Court found there was limited specifically and cautiously and by its expressed terms to sales by a license Indian trader to Indians, a class of sales of cigarettes which Washington statutes themselves exempt at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.563" offset="2153618">The Indian Trader Act, the First Section of which is 25 U.S.C. 261 speaks directly of sales to Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.307" offset="2188622">In fact, should the sec -- should the Act be construed to apply to sales by Indians to non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.070" offset="2219656">Section 262 and 264 clearly require each non-Indian purchaser to obtain an Indian trader’s license, to go and buy these cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.620" offset="2261870">The absurdity of this result indicates the absurdity of appellant’s claim that he is exempted by the Indian Trader Act from a general non-discriminatory excise tax on his sales to non-Indians.</text>

            <text syncTime="567.269" offset="2372420">I will certainly get to that what I consider to be a philosophical point because we will claim that Warren Trading Post is not applicable to the State of Washington because of PL 83-280.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.357" offset="2432815">The point I'm making now is that those cigarettes which we actually our attempting to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.306" offset="2456639">I think that exemption may have come into existence since the -- this since is rather -- this case has gone a long time since it came into existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.518" offset="2489448">But the point that we’re arguing for here is solely the proposition of sales to non-Indians.</text>

            <text syncTime="669.368" offset="2780871">The same legislature, which passed that statute, passed a conditional Appropriations Act of $8 million based on the usefulness of that Act in closing of these Indian cigarettes sales.</text>

            <text syncTime="692.965" offset="2875225">That Act by its terms simply says that the state will no longer engage in useless Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.972" offset="2907303">This Court has recognized -- the Court has recognized that a state can’t collect an excise tax from the purchaser after he has made a purchase and distribute it himself to his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.618" offset="2949831">An excise tax like this has got to be collected to the seller to be collected at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="841.015" offset="3467473">To the effect that the exemption from a use tax which we just couldn’t collect and which no state can collect.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.325" offset="3492655">This kind of exemption I'm sure exists in many state excise tax statutes where you don’t -- it’s impractical to try to make a criminal out of the purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.021" offset="3527450">You must collect these taxes from the seller or you can’t collect them at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.170" offset="3556080">Now, appellant’s next claim to a statutory exemption from these particular excise taxes is based on Section 6 of the General Allotment Act is applied by this Court in Squire versus Capoeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.252" offset="3612400">In that case, Chief Justice Warren stated that income from a timber sale from Mr. Capoeman’s allotment.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.783" offset="3638523">The sale over which he had no control was exempt from the federal tax on capital gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.143" offset="3663914">This Court found the sale to be the equivalent of a sale of the land itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.336" offset="3684707">The finding was obviously correct and equally obviously inapplicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.933" offset="3707068">Timber can be cut from land such as Mr. Capoeman’s, literally once in a lifetime or less and the land that was found by the Court had little, if any additional value so that the proceeds of the timber sale constituted the only income in all probability, which the allotment would provide for Mr. Capoeman in his lifetime and amounted for his purposes were concern to a sale of the whole property.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.260" offset="3812394">He had control over neither the fact nor the timing of the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.046" offset="3831515">Mr. Tonasket’s income here however is continuing.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.132" offset="3847920">It is neither based on the fruits of the land nor on its exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.224" offset="3868296">It is simple business income.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.477" offset="3881253">Moreover, Mr. Capoeman’s tax exemption had no adverse effects on timber sales by non-exempt landowners.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.373" offset="3912913">Mr. Tonasket’s claim on the other hand, if upheld can and will destroy the businesses of competing sellers of cigarettes or of any other commodity, which Mr. Tonasket chooses to sell at retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.676" offset="3970069">Finally, it seems doubtful that Mr. Tonasket’s inevitable claim to a federal income tax exemption on the profits of his sales is likely to have much appeal to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.613" offset="4021791">Yet, it is the logical corollary of the extension of Squire versus Capoeman to a situation now before you, which was certainly not in the minds of the Court at the time that which that case was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.732" offset="4078320">Appellant’s final statutory claim to exemption is based on Section 4 of PL 83-280 itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.792" offset="4110503">A statute designed to authorize the extension of state jurisdiction over Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.996" offset="4135372">The statute itself provides that it shall not “authorize the encumbrance or taxation of any real or personal property belonging to any Indian that is subject to a restriction against alienation imposed by the United States”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.887" offset="4202872">First of course, that statute doesn’t grant any tax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.474" offset="4221262">It simply preserves those granted by other statutes from encroachment by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.595" offset="4245713">Moreover, it like all of those other statutes except perhaps the Indian Trader Act deals solely with property taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.156" offset="4279986">Nothing can be more clear from the decisions this Court and for that matter practically every other court in the land then the distinction between property and non-property taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.581" offset="4325648">This Court in U.S. v. Detroit even allowed the taxation on the leasehold interest on federal lands leased to private persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.307" offset="4368593">The cigarette taxes and the sales taxes here in question are in no way property taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.419" offset="4397014">In addition, these excise taxes have two distinguishing features not shared by inheritance taxes involved in the Oklahoma cases or for that matter even by net income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.816" offset="4442676">First of course, the ultimate burden of these taxes does not normally rest on the business charge with paying or collecting them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.396" offset="4476949">They are passed on to the ultimate purchaser of the cigarettes or other items offered for sale by the retailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.677" offset="4506102">In fact, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, Washington State law requires that the sales tax be passed on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.639" offset="4529925">It is not permitted to be absorbed by the retailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.949" offset="4547166">Second of course, appellant’s claim involves the right to destroy all of his competition in the sale of cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.148" offset="4576005">Appellant asserts in his brief that the 3 cents tax by the Colville tribe on each pack if added to the state 16 cent tax will wipe out his ability to sell cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.504" offset="4629400">How many cigarettes then will a competitor in the City of Omak without appellant’s claim the exemptions sale subject to a 16-cent tax in competition with appellant’s 3 cents?</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.958" offset="4687182">For that matter, how many appliances can a non-Indian businessman in Omak sell on which he must charge of 5% sales tax in competition with appellant who claims the right to sell the same article free from taxes?</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.166" offset="4752071">For that matter, referring back to one of yesterday’s cases, can a similar businessman in Seattle sells cigarettes or appliances in competition with an Indian seller for whom that BIA acquires property in Seattle under the claim of right asserted here yesterday by the appellant in Skelera (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.970" offset="4839215">Please remember that this appellant is a citizen of the State of Washington entitled to the rights of every other citizen including police protection, schools, and every other state and local governmental service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.385" offset="4912880">Nor is this a theoretical entitlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.888" offset="4926882">All state and local governmental services are actually extended to Indians by Washington State often that a per capital cost to the state in excess of that to the average of non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.502" offset="4981426">In point of fact, we can at least asked the rhetorical question whether Congress could consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution require us first in 1924 to have all Indians as citizens and then say that they should pay no taxes at all and this arises in these cases not an income tax cases or inheritance tax cases, which affect only the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.990" offset="5083303">But in this case which affects other citizens of the state and their ability to do business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.189" offset="5112142">Now, at this point except in passing, I haven’t mentioned PL 83-280 for what I consider to be good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.935" offset="5155088">I do not believe that it extended the jurisdiction of the state to impose cigarette sales taxes, cigarette taxes, and sales taxes in Colville reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.270" offset="5196466">Because the state already had that right, but if there is any doubt about that jurisdiction, it is surely dispelled by PL 83-280.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.571" offset="5249651">And that statute is relevant in connection with the one point in this case and which the Solicitor General asserts the possession, sales of cigarettes to Indians which are tax-exempt under the doctrine of Warren Trading Post in the absence of PL 83-280.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.846" offset="5322794">Now, appellant has labored long in this murky legislative history of PL 83-280 without I submit producing a shred of evidence that it was intended to bar these taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.486" offset="5373367">He asserts that the law does nothing more than to extend state court jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2090.223" offset="8464280">There were -- there are several points that do need answering here and I would take them in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.873" offset="8482879">First, I am not surprised that the Attorney General came up finally with the bootstrap argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.951" offset="8503150">That argument is the state provides services therefore it should have the ability to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.867" offset="8526869">That’s a normative argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.301" offset="8532616">It has nothing to do with the statutory problem of acquiring jurisdiction for taxing.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="2111.383" offset="8548916">Then what does Section 280 mean when it says as to civil jurisdiction the states after they have gone under 280 will have jurisdiction over civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.179" offset="8612133">And to the same extents and this is the general part to the same extent that such state has jurisdiction over other several causes of action and those civil laws of such state that are of general application to private in persons and property?</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_l_pirtle" startTime="2147.239" stopTime="2295.512">
            <label>Mr. Robert L. Pirtle</label>
            <text syncTime="2147.239" offset="8692276">But Your Honor, the answer to that is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.694" offset="8706173">First, the language in there is not language of plenary grant such as you find in the Termination Acts, Klamath and Menominee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.947" offset="8739192">It’s very concise and it’s restricted to private persons and private property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.182" offset="8760090">Now, when you get to the cases and you can find this on page 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.833" offset="8774719">The cases are enumerated on the brief of NCAI.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.659" offset="8786004">You’ll find that civil law and criminal law are not the entire body of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.800" offset="8810559">There is an additional third class which is that law of the sort of interface between sovereignty and the citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.948" offset="8839189">The sovereignty of the state government or the federal government and the citizen mostly it comes up in connection with cases of administrative proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.496" offset="8877328">But a tax power is a sovereign power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.586" offset="8893733">In this case, we’re discussing the conflict between tribal tax power and state tax power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.755" offset="8914422">That is not a law of governing private persons and private property to use that narrow language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.742" offset="8938350">And the Attorney General failed to read to you from the last sentence in that letter from Ormie Louis which by the language with the published reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.740" offset="8970324">So, it’s nothing new.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.365" offset="8976802">He said, but with he said, this should make the state laws apply and to civil transactions among Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.836" offset="9014732">Taxing power by either state or the tribe is not a civil transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.126" offset="9031868">That clearly is outside the meaning of that narrow language and then he goes on to say, but with a minimum of interference with Indian control of Indian affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.267" offset="9072410">Now, the Court might say to itself that language is rather broad perhaps, it’s overly broad if the Court feels it’s overly broad, the Court can restrict it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.442" offset="9117132">And I suggest that the Court should restrict in accordance with the Court’s rule in the Holy Church case in which the church in New York imported a vicar from England for its preacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.154" offset="9171989">And they clearly violated a federal statute they said, you shall not import people from outside the country to take jobs for you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.225" offset="9200306">And this Court said, when language can be extended beyond the meaning of the legislature, it must be restricted to the intent of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.999" offset="9231339">When it says as specifically, here we don’t even have it specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.587" offset="9245759">We have just broad language of civil law as true, but then it’s narrowed by those modifiers to private persons and private property.</text>

            <text syncTime="2295.512" offset="9285465">But you’ve indicated that perhaps, there might be some ambiguity in 280 in the passage that are I was reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.665" offset="9313991">But the Committee Report on that after some preliminaries about the efforts to draw all Indians into the total culture goes on to say that it extends to those reservations the substantive civil laws of the respective States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.379" offset="9412838">Now, do you say that substantive civil laws do not include the tax statutes?</text>

            <text syncTime="2334.182" offset="9440110">It says substantive civil laws of the States and it goes on to talk about civil transactions among Indians.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert L. Pirtle</label>
            <text syncTime="2360.302" offset="9544600">I think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.559" offset="9553586">I would say that that has to do with the sovereign ability of a state to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.579" offset="9573648">The tax may fall on many areas of private property, transactions, excise, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.274" offset="9600502">But I think that that language when you look at the entire statute, look at the entire legislative history, there’s no tax talk specifically tax talk except on that discussion in the sub-committee hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.882" offset="9646895">And there it’s made very clear that Congress does not intend to any tax to be levied from the Indian people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.804" offset="9670614">It was never discussed and clearly, the Congress first purpose in the 1968 Act would be frustrated if they were eluding on of state taxes prior to the consent by the Indian people to jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.368" offset="9736861">Now, I answer one additional argument Your Honors and that is -- this is the bootstrap argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.855" offset="9762774">The argument that the state provides services and therefore they should have the power to tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="2419.971" offset="9783254">Well, Section 2 (b) and 4 (b) as I read them cited that this Section which is the at new law 280 shall -- nothing in this Section shall authorize the taxation of any real or personal property of any Indian or Indian tribe.</text>

            <text syncTime="2464.410" offset="9960991">I think it is Your Honor, but there are two points to be made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.675" offset="9974053">One is that the language of encumbrance -- this Court found on the Squire case to include also the federal income tax of problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.450" offset="10013132">And this Court ruled in the Rickert case that the General Allotment Act which required that there be no, at the end of the trust period, there’ll be no lien, there’ll be no prior debt which could attach to the property said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.387" offset="10068929">That language in extends not only to the land, but to the horse, the plow and the barns on that building.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.266" offset="10100485">That’s the personal property needed to use the land.</text>

            <text syncTime="2505.885" offset="10126921">I think not Your Honor, because it take -- compare Mr. Tonasket with Squire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.361" offset="10144789">Squire was lucky enough, fortunate enough not to have growing timber on his land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.152" offset="10159940">Mr. Tonasket has nothing but grass.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.824" offset="10170702">Now, the Congress -- the purpose of Congress today is in the promulgating the Tobacco Ordinance of the Colville tribe for example is clearly that trust land be utilized in a modern way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.193" offset="10224097">It is no part in expecting the Indian the poor Indian to be a farmer on his land in East Omak which is an Indian village.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.444" offset="10253145">When he has no timber on it and when the only really legitimate and sensible method of developing the land is some kind of a commercial enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.113" offset="10295777">Now, I would say additionally, Your Honors, that in the Kansas Indians case, this Court said specifically that conferring rights and privileges on the Indians cannot affect their situation which can only be changed by treaty stipulation or voluntary abandonment of their tribe and organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.005" offset="10367352">In the case which the Attorney General cited in his opinion as direct President Goody versus Smith, the Court the quotations there are from the In re. Heff case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.099" offset="10415731">Those are the ones in which the Court had earlier said Mr. Justice Rutledge and in a not very well thought out opinion that the General Allotment Act which conferred citizenship and the right to vote and participate in Government also made people subject to taxation and this Court specifically overruled Heff in United States versus Nice in 1916.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.737" offset="10502353">So, the very foundation of the Goody versus Smith case has been overruled by this Court.</text>
