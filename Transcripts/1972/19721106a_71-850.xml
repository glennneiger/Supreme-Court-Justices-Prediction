            <label>Mr. Philip A. Lacovara</label>
            <text syncTime="29.057" offset="219617">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.226" offset="232260">This case as I mentioned is the follow-up sequel to United States against Dionisio.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.629" offset="253889">It's also here on writ of certiorari to the Seventh Circuit, and in this case we have a slightly different factual setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.313" offset="288580">This was an investigation being pursued not by a special Grand Jury but by the regular September 1971 Grand Jury, and the Grand Jury was investigating a theft from interstate shipment and a conspiracy violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.919" offset="355035">Mr. Mara was subpoenaed before the grand jury and was directed by the grand jury foreman to give exemplars of his hand writing and his printing.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.236" offset="396309">And he returned -- refuse on constitutional grounds, essentially Fourth and Fifth Amendment grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.914" offset="423058">The Government then filed a petition with the District Court to compel Mr. Mara to give the handwriting and printing exemplars and in that petition, the Government alleged the nature of the grand jury investigation which is an investigation under Section 659, Theft from Interstate Shipment and 371, Conspiracy and it alleged that Mr. Mara had been asked for handwriting and printing exemplars which the grand jury considered essential and necessary solely for the purpose of comparing his handwriting to determine whether he was the author of certain writings that were before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.915" offset="587003">The petition further alleged that Mr. Mara had refused to obey the foreman’s direction and refused to give the handwriting and printing exemplars.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.610" offset="633814">The Government also in an attempt to comply with what it understood to be the requirement of United States v. Dionisio which we were nevertheless challenging before this Court, submitted in Camera to the District Court an affidavit by an FBI agent who had testified before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.848" offset="706748">And in that affidavit as the petition alleged, the Court would determine that if there were reasonable grounds, that reasonableness must be determined for the grand jury’s demand for the handwriting exemplars.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.434" offset="765158">The -- that affidavit was before the District Court at the hearing on the Government’s petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.858" offset="794833">The respondent objected to the petition for the exemplar order raising essentially two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.111" offset="827852">First, the contention was that the Government did not have probable cause to support the application, the argument being that since the grand jury had not indicted him, it clearly did not yet have probable cause to think that he was somehow linked with the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.235" offset="892322">And secondly, the objection was made that the Government was trying to support the petition by showing of reasonableness by submitting an affidavit that was not being made available.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.024" offset="939447">The District Judge ruled that an in camera submission was sufficient and also ruled that probable cause was not the standard necessary even under the Dionisio to secure an exemplar order.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.888" offset="994931">The respondent, Mr. Mara, was then ordered to provide such samples of his handwriting, his printing as the grand jury might deem necessary and in this case Mr. Justice Marshall the order explicitly did not make any reference I believe to the -- to any agents of the grand jury, it said to provide exemplars before and to the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.984" offset="1083329">There's been no objection – there was no objection at the hearing either before the grand jury or at the original hearing on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.780" offset="1118542">After the District Court entered its order, requiring the giving of the exemplars and Mr. Mara refused in open court to give the exemplars and was committed for contempt, Mr. Mara, through his counsel submitted an application for a stay or for bond, and in that application as he has since then, has urged the contention that it was improper to suggest or to direct that the handwriting exemplars be given to a sworn agent of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.006" offset="1251349">The argument is made, this goes beyond the lawful province of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.695" offset="1270157">I had to anticipate, I say that the Government position on this is the same as it was in the prior case that the refusal before the grand jury was a categorical one based on constitutional grounds not based on the local of the giving of the exemplars.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.790" offset="1334523">And both the petition and the order call only for the giving of exemplars before the grand jury, if respondent is willing to comply with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.134" offset="1375901">After the District Court denied bail or stay, the Court of Appeals did release Mr. Mara on bond and when the case was argued, the Court of Appeals also asked that the FBI agent's affidavit be submitted to it in camera and that was subsequently done.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.684" offset="1462105">The affidavit is now before this Court as a sealed exhibit, it is never been seen to the best of my knowledge by respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.198" offset="1496168">The Seventh Circuit reaffirmed its holding in Dionisio that the Fourth Amendment requires that the Government on behalf of the grand jury must make an affirmative showing of reasonableness before it can obtain an exemplar like this from a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.056" offset="1571610">The Court rejected Fifth and Sixth Amendment privilege and counsel claims for essentially the same reasons that it had in Dionisio, but it held here that it would address itself to the procedures that the Government had to avail itself in order to show reasonableness and would also discuss the substantive content of that reasonableness showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.206" offset="1676204">On both points, the Seventh Circuit held that the Government on behalf of the grand jury had been deficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.890" offset="1706924">On the question of the proper procedure, the Seventh Circuit ruled that in order to demonstrate reasonableness, the Government must submit its affidavit or any other proof it wants to bring to the attention of the District Court in an open and adversary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.735" offset="1774320">So the Court of Appeals said, the respondent can have an opportunity to litigate the sufficiency of the Government showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.876" offset="1818833">The Court ruled that grand jury's secrecy is not a magical incantation and was not applicable in this kind of setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.627" offset="1857912">On the question of the substantive showing, the content of the reasonableness determination, the Court imposed a number of factual requirements that must be affirmatively demonstrated by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.325" offset="1908694">These are set forth of course in the Court’s opinion which is printed as an appendix to the cert petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.800" offset="1934608">The Court of Appeals stated at the outset that the Government must show that what is being conducted is a lawful, properly authorized grand jury investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.574" offset="1985703">That the investigation is probing some objective that Congress can permissibly authorize.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.398" offset="2012975">It must also show that what is being sought is relevant to the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.819" offset="2034604">That’s exactly the kind of preliminary showing of this Court in Branzburg, not to mention many other cases that are cited in the various briefs has refused to require grand jury to show before it could conduct its inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.264" offset="2092387">In addition to what it termed the showing of relevance to the inquiry, the Seventh Circuit insisted that the Government must show that the grand jury process is not being abused, and that the exemplars being sought are adequate, but not excessive to its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.770" offset="2162500">Now that rather ambiguous formulation was amplified by the Seventh Circuit which went on to say that this meant that the Government had to show exactly with more specific detail on the FBI agent's affidavit before it had shown, what the purpose of the identification evidence was, what its connection was with the crime being investigated, what the witness's connection is between the identification, evidence and the crime might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.816" offset="2294680">The Government also has to show according to the Seventh Circuit in order to obtain the exemplar that the evidence, the identification evidence is not otherwise available, again, another test that the Court explicitly rejected in Branzburg in the First Amendment context and the Court said that it would regard the grand jury process as being abused, if the Government failed to show that it was unable to obtain this material in any other way because the Court said, “Having a grand jury obtain evidence that investigators might otherwise be able to come upon is an abusive process.”</text>
            <text syncTime="588.094" offset="2455698">We think that is also an unsupportable position, but in any event, the Court found that the showing of the Government had made in the affidavit submitted in camera did not rise to the level of showing these stringent standard -- meeting the stringent standards of relevancy non-abusive grand jury process, and direct link between the witness whose identification, whose evidence was being sought and the other materials before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.308" offset="2572622">The Government promptly filed a petition to review that decision and in the interim, Judge Friendly had a virtually identical case before him in the Second Circuit, a case of United States against Doe, Mr. Schwartz, the real party in interest and in that decision, Judge Friendly taking specific note of both Dionisio and Mara, ruled that reasonableness was not the standard that had to be met as an affirmative matter in obtaining this kind of exemplar, handwriting exemplar and that in any event, if there is to be some sort of preliminary showing of reasonableness, the test certainly can’t be as burdensome and as intense as the Seventh Circuit has suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.316" offset="2776586">The bedrock position that we take in this case of course is identical to the one in Dionisio and that is that the grand jury witness is lawfully before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.463" offset="2825174">Apart from a Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination, the witness has the obligation that every other citizens has to appear and to give testimony to cooperate in the grand jury's investigation even if that means giving some physical, some non-communicative or non-testimonial evidence that maybe involved in the grand jury's investigation of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.192" offset="2916185">We think it's settled that the Fifth Amendment does not apply to this kind of inquiry as even the Seventh Circuit has held.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.201" offset="2956204">We also believe that like a voice exemplar, handwriting is the kind of identifying physical characteristic that one does not have a reasonable expectation about.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.370" offset="3004897">His handwriting is customarily made available in all sorts of casual contacts and that the grand jury is not usurping any untoward power, is not impinging upon any privacy when it asks the witness to provide it with a sample of his handwriting.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.758" offset="3078353">Now, there's some argument in this case as in the other that giving of exemplar evidence is somehow different for Fourth Amendment purposes from the giving of oral testimony which we all concede is not covered by the Fourth Amendment because giving of exemplar evidence involves an act of the will.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.920" offset="3167065">It involves an affirmative, physical act to create in the words of the legal aid agency's brief, to create the evidence that is being sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.936" offset="3207084">Well in a sense, there is a creative process that is at work here.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.534" offset="3225475">The witness is being asked for a voice exemplar or for a handwriting exemplar must as a matter of intellect and will, decide that he will cooperate.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.501" offset="3261419">He must order his muscles, his diaphragm, his larynx or his hands in this kind of case, to manifest the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.729" offset="3294333">But we cannot see that there is any constitutional difference between that kind of voluntary action, that kind of cooperation, and the kind of voluntary action or cooperation that an ordinary grand jury witness is being asked for oral testimony, he must furnish.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.880" offset="3362879">He too when asked what do you know about the accident that occurred on 43rd street or when asked, what you know about gambling in Kell, Illinois, must go through the same cognitive process, deciding whether he will voluntarily formulate a response, whether he will order his body to provide the evidence that will intelligible to the grand jury itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.711" offset="3462248">He has to create the evidence that it has to be laid before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.798" offset="3478549">We think that for Fourth Amendment purposes no more -- no less than for Fifth Amendment purposes, there is no relevant constitutional distinction between the giving of oral testimony that is unprivileged and the giving of physical exemplar evidence that is not itself subject to an expectation of privacy and that we submit is this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.323" offset="3572694">Now, moving along to the standards and as Mr. Justice Stewart asked in the earlier case, if the Court agrees with the Second Circuit and disagrees with the Seventh in the Dionisio decision, and holds that there is no burden on the grand jury to show reasonableness before it can expect compliance with its orders than the two issues that are before the Court in this case become academic.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.067" offset="3667675">That is the procedure to be followed in showing reasonableness and the content of the reasonableness showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.446" offset="3693171">But assuming the Court, decides that there is some obligation of this sort, we submit that in this kind of context, a current ongoing grand jury investigation, the procedure that was followed in this case is quite sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.785" offset="3758477">That is the submission of an in camera affidavit which the District Judge can examine to determine whether it is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.586" offset="3793690">We think that cases relied on by the Seventh Circuit are quite at odds with the customary obligations of adversary litigation, and we also emphasize that we're talking here about a grand jury proceeding where there is a need for dispatch, there is a need for secrecy, there is a need for simplifying the proceedings, especially when as we believe is the case, there are no major constitutional values implicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.083" offset="3919705">Now, the submission of an ex parte affidavit to the Court to make some legal test of it, of its sufficiency is not at all unusual in this kind of setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.796" offset="3966516">It is the traditional procedure with the search warrant and it is been thought necessary that the warrant can actually be issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.139" offset="3995878">This is what actually happens, the warrant is issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.773" offset="4006431">Whatever privacy is involved is already invaded pursuant to that warrant before there is any opportunity to test its sufficiency and adversary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.706" offset="4050213">But going beyond that, the cases relied on, like Davis against the United States, the grand jury minutes case or Alderman, the illegal electronic surveillance case, talked about the necessity for an adversary hearing because the inquiry in that area was one of relevance and a relevance determination is one that turns on a lot subtle factors, which cannot always be recognized by a judge who isn’t as close to the evidence, to the investigation, to the background as the adverse party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.137" offset="4191901">But even in Alderman, the Court said that they are related kinds of inquiries that can be made, and made decisively and finally ex parte by the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.077" offset="4235682">And in fact in subsequent cases also reported in the same volume of the US reports, Giordano and Taglianetti, the Court explicitly affirmed that District Judges acting in camera without an adversary hearing could decide such issues as whether a person had standing to complain about a Fourth Amendment violation and could even decide ex parte without any contest from an adverse litigant, that in particular electronic surveillance was legal and that determination would not be subject to any adversarial litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.856" offset="4386774">We consider this kind of case a fortiori because if a District Judge can make a decisive and conclusive determination that an electronic surveillance is lawful and can make that without giving any opportunity to the other side to contest that determination, we think in a much more extreme posture of an ongoing grand jury investigation, there is even less justification for demanding that the Government showing of reasonableness, if any it must make, must be subjected to full litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.555" offset="4537553">And in this case, I might point out what we have is an order by the Court of Appeals that the respondent in an exemplar case must be given an opportunity to test the sufficiency of the Government's showing, and I think that clearly contemplates a full trial-type or hearing-type proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.402" offset="4628982">That I think is --</text>

            <text syncTime="1221.464" offset="4989262">We think that is the kind of determination that can be made ex parte on the basis of a submission by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.230" offset="5016325">This is the kind of determination that a judge who is presented with an application for a search warrant customarily makes, and he even has to make higher standard of determination than in this case, because the Seventh Circuit hasn’t said the probable cause is the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.902" offset="5082990">But we are content in our system to allow District Judges to make ex parte determinations of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.409" offset="5112978">And I think, even though you are correct that the Court hasn’t completely ruled on all of these electronic surveillance issues in Taglianetti as I say, the Court did affirm the ex parte procedure that was followed in the determining who had been overheard and who hadn’t, and in Giordano, which was a master order sending back for further proceedings in a number of electronic surveillance cases, Mr. Justice Stewart explicitly stating in his concurring opinion that the Court was in no way intimating that ex parte proceedings were not satisfactory to determine legality and that in fact has been the process that’s been followed in lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.013" offset="5295417">So, we think then the rationale for the adversary hearing cases is inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.593" offset="5321749">On the other side, we have what is a legitimate value, and that is the value of grand jury secrecies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.436" offset="5349125">We're not talking now about attempts to keep the minutes of grand jury proceedings secret so that they can't be used to impeach a witness when he testifies years afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.725" offset="5390294">We’re talking about a requirement that the Seventh Circuit has imposed, that the Government make an open showing of the current status of a grand jury proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.659" offset="5433971">We think that is probably the -- as a distant from the legitimate purposes of grand jury secrecy which are designed to provide the grand jury an opportunity to pursue its investigation without providing any tip off either to the witnesses or to other people who may not be called before the grand jury about the focus of the grand jury's investigation, its progress thus far, which witnesses may so far have been called before or which witnesses may not had been?</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.257" offset="5552358">We think that balancing those two factors, the lack of any substantial need for an adversary litigation of a showing of reasonableness against the very considerable interest of preserving the secrecy of an ongoing grand jury combined to render the Seventh Circuit's decision wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.208" offset="5640234">The separate inquiry of course is one of the standard of reasonableness of the Seventh Circuit in explaining what it meant in Dionisio by listing all of the criteria that must be met here, I think it has gone far beyond with this Court has ever intimated, must be shown, certainly in any grand jury investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.237" offset="5728319">The Court imposes a very stringent obligation of showing relevancy which is perhaps even more intense than the similar suggestion that had been made and rejected in Branzburg and I think, it is our position for a much less justifiable constitutional objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.004" offset="5807417">Furthermore, the requirement that the Government -- the grand jury must show the evidence is not otherwise available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.779" offset="5842526">Another criterion that was rejected in Branzburg is unwarranted, is somewhat unrealistic because at the one end, if the witness himself is agreeable to providing a grand jury -- providing a handwriting exemplar, we don’t have the litigation that we're confronted with today where the witness refuses on constitutional grounds to cooperate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.459" offset="5949210">On the hand, it's not difficult to see that using other investigative channels to secure handwriting exemplars maybe even more intrusive on Fourth Amendment interests, then is issuing court process, asking a person to come to the United States Courthouse where in secrecy he can provide an exemplar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.087" offset="6035728">It would be possible presumably for FBI agents to go to a person’s bank, or to a credit agency, or to his employer, and ask whether they will supply exemplars of the -- would be witness' handwriting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.439" offset="6097168">I don’t think that the Court should regard the lack of use of those alternatives as something the Government must affirmatively apologize for, before it asks a grand jury witness to provide exemplars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.651" offset="6161951">The level of the showing that the Seventh Circuit has imposed in this decision, I think can best be illustrated by a reading of the Government’s petition before the District Court which set out specifically the offense that was being investigated by the grand jury, which set out specifically that the grand jury thought it necessary for this witness to provide handwriting and printing exemplars so that the grand jury could determine whether he was the author of particular writings already before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.942" offset="6303117">In that context, I think, if that showing does not meet whatever reasonableness showing the Constitution may call for, of course, we argue that it calls for none, the standard must be something quite close to probable cause which is an anomalous requirement since probable cause is the end of the grand jury's inquiry not its beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.221" offset="6396217">For that reason, we request that the judgment Seventh Circuit be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1588.374" offset="6456822">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.352" offset="6480750">I would like to start my argument before this Court to get to certain aspects of the facts as they evolved in this Mara case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.611" offset="6525785">The Government has just conceded the point that this was not a special grand jury that Mara was called before, it was just an ordinary grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.099" offset="6567790">He appeared in the US Attorney’s office in Chicago on two separate occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.683" offset="6594121">He was asked for his handwriting exemplars not by the grand jury or the foreman to the grand jury, but by the US Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.571" offset="6641664">He was asked to return to the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.555" offset="6653576">He was asked again by the US Attorney, the assistant in the grand jury room to supply these handwriting exemplars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.121" offset="6699865">And upon his refusal to do so on constitutional grounds, the US Attorney directed the foreman of the grand jury to direct the witness to supply the handwriting exemplars and that's how that it came -- there came about the petition, then before the District Courts at (Inaudible) in our district and the order, the petition which is set forth in the appendix asked for the giving of these handwriting exemplars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.391" offset="6828910">To this day, we do not know what is in that affidavit which was submitted in camera to Judge Robson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.345" offset="6868720">The first that the witness or his counsel knew of what -- some semblance of what was in that affidavit is what was set forth in the Circuit Court of Appeals' opinion wherein they stated that the contents of affidavit were solely the work product of an FBI agent, the sole product of an FBI agent, and that it was investigation which occurred outside the scope of a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.534" offset="6989511">Mara was not afforded an opportunity of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.083" offset="7003721">No kind of procedure was afforded him outside the grand jury room wherein and whereby he would give exemplars to a FBI agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.787" offset="7042487">We do not know whether or not the FBI agent was the duly designated authorized agent of a grand jury and in that posture, that is how that case came before the US Court of Appeals, and it is now presently before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.414" offset="7113017">We do not, that is Mara, we do not concede that the exemplars sought by the Government are non-testimonial or non-communicative because we just do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.926" offset="7175084">We have no ideas, I've stated this to what in these affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.158" offset="7192012">It well might be that what this grand jury or precisely what the Government wanted was a matter which was essentially germane to the Government’s case and to prove a case against Mara because as they stated in their petition for order, he was a potential defendant in an investigation with reference to the statutes involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="2024.597" offset="8201801">We raise the testimonial and communicative nature of the exemplars before this Court because if it is selectively germane to proving the Government case then the Fifth Amendment would apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="2562.738" offset="10354291">Chief Judge Campbell was a judge in our Court for some 32 years and for many years, he reigned as the Chief Judge and he knew a little about grand juries and their operations and what occurred and it was his opinion in that speech that grand jury should be abolished because any US Attorney who deems it necessary, can indict anybody for any reason whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.881" offset="10470902">And that the grand jury does not function today as an arm to stand between the accused and the accuser and on that basis, it should be abolished and I concur in that expression, especially in view of what has occurred in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2679.191" offset="10820106">We believe that some characteristics are protected and that handwriting exemplars is one of the ones that is protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.509" offset="10853439">The particular exemplars sought by any agency is not in plain view and that is the reason why the particular agency or the grand jury must seek it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.679" offset="10894085">Furthermore, the authorship of the exemplar which is already in the possession of the intervening investigating agency or the grand jury is unknown.</text>

            <text syncTime="2720.713" offset="10986245">I would take the same position with respect to fingerprints.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.918" offset="10998993">I think that there were some distinctions which was raised by the Court before with respect to voice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.319" offset="11024697">The person coming before the grand jury generally responds with his voice and if the Government can use that as a particular way of securing an exemplar, that is distinguished from the usual -- that the handwriting exemplar which is generally not use as a means of communication unless the defendant wishes to do it or unless the witness wishes to do it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.108" offset="11111842">Also the question of the scar in a generally undisclosed place, I think that is protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.071" offset="11135666">On the other hand, facial features or scar on the face would not be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.554" offset="11153638">I think we have to look at the normal context of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.714" offset="11166177">What is generally in open view and what is generally not in open view to be produced or created or performed by the individual in the context of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.061" offset="11207659">I think, if we look at Schmerber and Davis, we can come to the conclusion that handwriting exemplars are indeed protected by the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.419" offset="11241096">In Schmerber, the question was whether the Government had to get a warrant, to get a blood sample after a person was properly arrested, based on probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.333" offset="11276727">And the holding there was that they didn’t have to get the warrant because there were exigent circumstances and there was probable cause for the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.974" offset="11307238">So, we come to the particular circumstance that blood is protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.466" offset="11325210">If we look at Davis, this Court is quite correct in stating that the holding in Davis does not say that fingerprinting is protected by the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.798" offset="11362513">They didn’t have to say it there because it was obtained in otherwise unconstitutional circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.078" offset="11383724">But I think the inference from Davis is that indeed it is the fingerprint itself and not the context in which it was taken which controls because otherwise, the Court would not have had to have gone to such great lengths to explain that fingerprints are reliable because they are unique, because they could be obtained in a one shot affair, because it's not necessary to repeat, because it's a simple procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.373" offset="11484871">If we were talking about the means or the context in which the exemplar was taken or the fingerprints were taken that would be one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.793" offset="11522591">But the Court went on to Davis to explain by a lower standard for obtaining fingerprint would be permissible; looking at the characteristics of the fingerprints and not at the characteristics of the proceeding in which it was obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.334" offset="11576717">Proposed Rule 41 (1), I think shares or draws from Davis this implication because under 41 (1) (h) (6), a person who is requested to give non-testimonial identification can come to the magistrate who issued the order and say can this be taken at my home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.322" offset="11660622">And if it -- and assuming that it can be taken at his home or not in a Government agency or not in a courtroom, there is nothing inherently coercive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.212" offset="11696253">We're not talking about a custodial situation such as a police station and I think that’s where the Second Circuit’s opinion in short is in error by combining the characteristic exemplar with the atmosphere in which it was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.585" offset="11761664">If we look to the question of whether the Fourth Amendment should apply to the grand jury, the Government keeps arguing and as it has before that the grand jury’s powers are unlimited, they refer to Branzburg, they refer to Blair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.852" offset="11822791">But in every one of these cases, the question which was raised was one of testimony which has been traditionally protected by the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.194" offset="11868139">Never, except in these recent series of cases, including another Second Circuit decision, US against Doe -- (Devlin) has the scope of the grand jury gone beyond testimonial items and I include within that context, books, and records and documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.441" offset="11933132">This is a new expansion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.901" offset="11938983">It appears from the history of the grand jury process into areas not before covered by the grand jury process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.557" offset="11973569">Now, I think that that distinguishes cases like Branzburg and Blair which deal with the traditional grand jury power to secure testimony subject to the Fifth Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.703" offset="12026232">And I think that the Government in explaining the scope of the grand jury power forgets that even the power to get testimonial evidence is limited by the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.006" offset="12071372">So, it seems that where the grand jury power is to go beyond its traditional scope of requesting testimonial evidence, including books and records which is protected by the Fifth Amendment, to something non-testimonial, that the non-testimonial aspect should also be protected and the grand jury’s power limited in an appropriate -- by an appropriate constitutional protection in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.131" offset="12171891">Historically, I think the balance fits properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.945" offset="12191117">Historically as I said, the Fifth Amendment protected against invasions of testimonial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.349" offset="12228733">There was no need to apply the Fourth Amendment because the grand jury didn’t seek such evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.013" offset="12251408">With Wade and Gilbert, this other evidence is now considered to be non-testimonial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.842" offset="12270738">If the grand jury wishes to secure that evidence by not affording some protection against the request for it, the power of the grand jury is greatly broadened beyond what it has traditionally been and I might add that the opinion in US against Doe (Schwartz) refers to the fact that Rule 41 (1) refers to a Second Circuit opinion in US against Doe (Devlin), but in Doe (Devlin) the Fourth Amendment issue was never raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.008" offset="12391424">It was ordered entirely on the Fifth Amendment and the issue in Doe (Devlin) was whether a person could be punished for contempt for refusing to give the requested exemplar when if they had refuse to give that same exemplar to a police office coming for it, they could not be held in contempt and of course, that's one of the problems we have which is posed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.787" offset="12474493">If an individual refuses to give a policeman or an FBI agent or some other Government agent an exemplar where they do not come with the court order, they cannot be punish for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.613" offset="12513782">On the other hand, if they refuse to give that same exemplar to grand jury that requests it, under the position taken by the Government, they can be held in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.570" offset="12561638">I think that the standard for determining if the Fourth Amendment applies as we assert it does, the standard for determining when the Government can secure this evidence has been outlined in such cases as Camara and Terry where the Court is willing to say, “Let us balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.111" offset="12643767">What are the needs on one side?</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.442" offset="12653171">What are the constitutional protections on the other side?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.449" offset="12665187">And I think that if we look at in that context, we can come out with a test which satisfies both requirements.</text>

            <text syncTime="3159.750" offset="12742405">The Government claims that the interruption of the grand jury process is a policy against permitting an adversary hearing in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.853" offset="12778768">The context here is one of the contempt preceding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.111" offset="12791829">That has always been the exception on the cases like Cobbledick and Gabel (ph) and Costello for a challenge to the grand jury process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.092" offset="12823698">And traditionally, an attack on the grand jury process in terms of a refusal to obey, means that the case goes to a Court for purposes of the contempt proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.009" offset="12859434">And it is in that context, that it is appropriate, that the witness in this context where he claims the Fourth Amendment privilege be permitted to challenge the subpoena requiring production of the exemplar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.809" offset="12910634">It is the Court and the not the grand jury that would make the determination as to whether the Constitution is a protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.502" offset="12937383">There is no fact question involved in the ultimate sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.997" offset="12951385">It's a constitutional question which must be resolved by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.027" offset="12971447">If we look at the warrant situation as an analogy to this one, it is true that a warrant is obtained in an ex-parte proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.170" offset="13004048">However, usually in the warrant context there is a need for speed to prevent the destruction of evidence or to make sure that the defendant does not plead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.050" offset="13047620">And then, there is suppression hearing, if the defendant isn’t -- the potential defendant is indicted and if the search was unreasonable in the sense, for instance, if the warrant is refused and the defendant’s house or office is torn apart, there maybe a civil damages action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.535" offset="13109478">Here in this context as I said, there is no need for speed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.034" offset="13131525">The defendant is around or the witness is around.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.942" offset="13143124">He is unlikely to destroy his hand so that he will not give an exemplar or to cut off his hair so that he need not give a hair sample.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.921" offset="13179068">In any case, the hair can grow back and so, we have a real difference in need in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.842" offset="13206758">And just briefly to summarize there is an intrusion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.516" offset="13221386">The intrusion is not an invasion into the body as it is in the context of blood, but it is a compulsion by an order to produce something.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.935" offset="13255137">And under this Court decision in Morton Salt, we look at the way in which the item can be obtained to determine if there is an intrusion and here compulsion is equal to intrusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3471.948" offset="13991163">Mrs. Bamberger, I take it one differing factor between your application of the deposition rules of relevancy in a grand jury proceedings is that in your civil proceeding, your issues are pretty well delineated by your complaint and answer whereas you don’t have any similar format for the grand jury proceeding that would enable you to say, is it or is it not within the limits framed by a particular set of documents?</text>

            <text syncTime="3500.782" offset="14106520">Well, in the context of the grand jury proceedings that -- what you say about the civil proceeding is correct and I would say that in the context of a grand jury proceeding, the usual way it comes up is that the Government has collected some kind of case and has prepared an indictment and it goes to the grand jury to present its evidence and it has a framework with which it could make a presentation to a District Court in a contempt proceeding and the Government is not functioning in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.553" offset="14233579">They have obviously done more upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.560" offset="14241625">Now, in the context of the grand jury doing its own investigation, where there is no Government presentation, the grand jury, I think in order to demand an exemplar must tell the District Court once again that its investigation has led it to a certain point on which they believe that the exemplar would be relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.256" offset="14344443">In the sense that it would be helpful in determining if this particular person was connected to the crime which it was investigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.065" offset="14375581">Of course, in that case I would assume also they would have to seek the aid of the US Attorney in making the application to the Court for a petition, in case the witness refused to comply with the request of the grand jury.</text>
