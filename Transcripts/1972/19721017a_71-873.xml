            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll hear arguments next in No. 71-873, United States against Falstaff Brewing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.932" offset="271130">Mr. Kauper, you may proceed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kauper" startTime="44.481" stopTime="187.590">
            <label>Mr. Kauper</label>
            <text syncTime="44.481" offset="281266">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.743" offset="294327">This is an appeal under the Expediting Act from the order of the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island dismissing the Government's complaint with the antitrust laws against the Falstaff Brewing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.568" offset="345631">The complaint alleges that the 1965 acquisition by Falstaff Brewing Corporation, the Nation's fourth largest brewer of the assets of the Narragansett Brewing Company, the largest brewer in New England violates Section 7 of the Clayton Act as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.252" offset="416371">Like Greeley, the preceding case on the docket, it is a potential competition case.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.594" offset="441762">Central to the case is the need to halt and if possible to reverse the increasing trend towards concentration in the brewing industry in local markets, a trend which was both noted with concern and was the primary basis for this Court's 1966 holding in United States against Pabst Brewing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.160" offset="527966">The market in this case is not in dispute, it is stipulated, it is the production and sale of beer in the New England area comprised of the six New England States.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.835" offset="570702">There is no allegation in the case at the time of the acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.166" offset="588048">There was any direct competition between Falstaff and Narragansett.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.508" offset="613439">The Government alleged rather that Falstaff was a significant potential competitor in this market that the market was concentrated and becoming increasingly so and that the net effect of its elimination as a potential competitor therefore substantially lessened competition within the meaning of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.128" offset="699852">More particularly, the Government alleged that Falstaff had the incentive to enter -- it had the financial capability to enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.020" offset="731408">It had reasonable prospects for a successful de novo or toe-hold entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.041" offset="759515">The District Court relying on two findings dismissed the Government's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.255" offset="784384">More specifically, the Court concluded that Falstaff's management had considered the acquisition by other means, find them unprofitable, and that therefore, the decision was made by Falstaff not to enter this market by any means other than the acquisition of Narragansett.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kauper</label>
            <text syncTime="204.987" offset="923355">More specifically, if I'm right, the allegation and the evidence submitted would tend to indicate that it is one of the Nation's 10 largest brewers.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.283" offset="964524">Seven of those brewers are already in the New England market.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kauper" startTime="219.998" stopTime="229.423">
            <label>Mr. Kauper</label>
            <text syncTime="219.998" offset="983333">Two of them -- well, I don't know who had said they were way out west but they were significantly further west than Falstaff and they are also significantly smaller than Falstaff.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="229.423" stopTime="242.205">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="229.423" offset="1021053">So, at least in argument you're going to say that Falstaff had superior opportunity and resources to any other brewing not already in the New England market to enter.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kauper" startTime="242.205" stopTime="248.129">
            <label>Mr. Kauper</label>
            <text syncTime="242.205" offset="1072149">I believe that was the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.368" offset="1076851">I don't think we would have to establish that it was absolutely the only one that could do so.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="248.129" stopTime="260.757">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="248.129" offset="1095868">On the other hand, if the record showed there were 15 or 20 with equal access and resources of the potential competition argument would be much less than Falstaff.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kauper" startTime="260.757" stopTime="272.229">
            <label>Mr. Kauper</label>
            <text syncTime="260.757" offset="1146441">Yes, I think if -- if the evidence were to demonstrate that there were very large number of potential entrants, then clearly one would have to take the position elimination of one had no particular impact.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="272.229" stopTime="286.033">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="272.229" offset="1192312">In other words, part of the potential competition theory I should suppose would be a proof that the potential entrant was -- if not unique at least one of a very small group, would it not be?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kauper" startTime="286.033" stopTime="1041.865">
            <label>Mr. Kauper</label>
            <text syncTime="286.033" offset="1247483">I think that essentially is correct, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.142" offset="1259917">So that its elimination had some consequence, otherwise clearly it would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.098" offset="1283741">The court below, we believe misconceived standards which are to be applied in this sort of a case, more particularly in its two key holdings, we believe that it improperly relied upon subjective statements made after the fact as to what the intentions of Falstaff's management would have been at a previous point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.788" offset="1370572">Second, we believe that it failed to recognize the concentrated nature of the market in the New England area.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.819" offset="1402650">In finding that, this particular market was “intensely competitive”.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.239" offset="1428355">Finally, we believe it put undue weight upon certain post-acquisition evidence which tended to indicate that following the acquisition by Falstaff, Narragansett's market share declined.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.400" offset="1476942">Let me now briefly deal with the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.587" offset="1489690">The New England beer market, first of all, is a growing market sales -- total sales increased by 9.5% during the period from 1960 to 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.374" offset="1536920">In 1960, the top eight firms in the market controlled 74% of the sales, by 1964, that figure was 81%.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.972" offset="1575267">In 1960, the top four firms controlled 50% of the market, the top four firms in 1965, 61.3% of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.900" offset="1614973">In the seven years preceding the acquisition, the number of brewers operating plants in New England declined from 11 to 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.439" offset="1657083">In short, we believe that this evidence carefully tracks the same trends which were noted by this Court in United States against Pabst Brewing Company in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.476" offset="1701282">The increasing trend towards concentration, the decline in number of brewers is approximately the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.440" offset="1737122">We also, as I indicated, Mr. Justice Stewart, the facts are indicated that there are 10 -- of the 10 largest brewers in the Nation, seven are already marketing in the New England area.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.287" offset="1784560">The remaining three -- of the remaining three, Falstaff is clearly the largest, it is also the one most geographically proximate to the New England market although I think we would all recognize that it's not within, let's suppose, a hundred mile.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.499" offset="1853419">The market is characterized as is the marketing at most beer by heavy promotional and advertising expenditure.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.188" offset="1884139">The Narragansett Brewing Company acquired by Falstaff at the time of acquisition was the leading brewer in terms of sales in the New England area with approximately 20% of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.183" offset="1928129">It was at the time of the acquisition, a healthy firm, its profits and sales had increased substantially during the four years prior to the acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.912" offset="1970970">It had engaged in significant planned expansion and indeed inquired -- acquired certain assets from certain other brewers during that same period.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.544" offset="2005556">Its distribution system was primarily through independent wholesale distributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.003" offset="2027395">They were not bound by contract to Narragansett, to handle Narragansett's beer exclusively and indeed the evidence suggest than in most instances they did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.964" offset="2067205">The Falstaff Brewing Company, the acquiring corporation, at the time of the acquisition was the fourth largest brewer in the United States having 5.9% of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.308" offset="2112554">It at that time operated eight breweries.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.731" offset="2126346">Most of those breweries had been acquired by Falstaff during a 20-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.967" offset="2151215">In most instance, there were small failing breweries of capacities of some hundred, two hundred thousand barrels.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.506" offset="2185383">In each instance, Falstaff had substantially modernized those plants, had greatly expanded their capacity, and in that manner, had developed the system which made them, by 1965, the fourth largest brewer in the Nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.097" offset="2251734">During the period preceding -- immediately preceding the acquisition, Falstaff's sales and profits had also expanded greatly.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.747" offset="2286320">It was a financially healthy company.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.686" offset="2298128">It had no difficulty in securing capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.456" offset="2313174">Falstaff distributed its beer in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.767" offset="2326444">Approximately 80% of its beer in various markets was distributed through independent wholesale distributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.432" offset="2357060">Most of those distributors were non-exclusive distributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.506" offset="2373360">I think the figure is something like 75% of the total wholesale distributors did not carry Falstaff's line exclusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.641" offset="2409932">The balance of its beer was distributed through its own owned branch operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.062" offset="2431666">Now that was true in cities where it operated breweries.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.668" offset="2442010">It was also true in the number of cities in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.361" offset="2456848">So that it was experienced with at least two types of distribution system namely the independent wholesale distributor as well as the branch distributor which it owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.019" offset="2503450">So far as entry is concerned, Falstaff had conceived or perceived by -- that national breweries and you had Mr. Metzger in the previous case referred to probably the four best known international brewers, by virtue of their national status had certain competitive advantages over Falstaff.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.691" offset="2586102">This includes the ability to advertise on a national basis and what is referred to as the so-called prestige factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.502" offset="2617344">In fact, an individual who goes in to buy a can or a bottle of beer, he gets accustomed to a particular brand which he can find anywhere in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.855" offset="2654751">In 1958, Falstaff commissioned a report to be made ahead on its future growth.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.824" offset="2678680">That report is referred to throughout the record as the Arthur D. Little Report which was submitted to Falstaff in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.829" offset="2714728">That report was designed to indicate the method of growth for the Falstaff Brewing Company in the years to come.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.110" offset="2743777">It made a number of recommendations but I'd -- let me refer to three.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.692" offset="2762167">First, it rather clearly and categorically stated that if Falstaff was to expand its sales, it would need to become a national brewer, but national brewer status.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.548" offset="2805530">Second, it recommended that entry be made into new markets by the building of new brewers.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.259" offset="2836459">Specifically, in the context of our case, it suggested that -- excuse me -- Falstaff should enter into the New England market -- pardon, the Northeastern market by the building of a new brewery, which was to be located in Baltimore, Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.285" offset="2904482">But more generally, it concluded that building of a new brewery was more economical than entry by other means.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.403" offset="2945024">It also indicated that distribution by Falstaff through its own company-owned outlets was more profitable to Falstaff than entry -- pardon me, distribution through the use of independent distributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.589" offset="3005733">Following a receipt of that report, Falstaff began through public pronouncement and otherwise to indicate its desire to become a national brewery.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.165" offset="3052022">Foremost among its desires was an entry into the Northeastern market.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.532" offset="3077517">In pursuing that particular goal, it had negotiations with several other brewers before culmination of the acquisition of Narragansett.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.348" offset="3124746">These brewers -- I think it -- must be indicated that at least in several instances came to Narragansett and not came to Falstaff and not the other way around, but there were extended negotiations with the Liebmann Brewing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.957" offset="3183156">There were extended negotiations with Rheingold Brewers.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.185" offset="3196113">These are both brewers operating primarily or have brewing headquarters in New York -- in the New York City area but marketing in the New England area.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.018" offset="3235401">Employees were sent to visit the plants of the Piel brewery, plants both in New York and Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.154" offset="3259956">There were contacts made with other brewers in the Upstate New York area and indeed contacts inquiries made of Falstaff by several smaller brewers, at least two, pardon me, in the New England areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.561" offset="3321605">Now it's in that setting that the Government contends that the acquisition of Narragansett by Falstaff eliminated a significant potential competitor from this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.054" offset="3375626">Falstaff does not, as we understand it, deny that it had the capability, financial, technical capability to enter the New England market, nor does it deny at least in general -- in general that it had a strong incentive to enter the Northeastern market.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.296" offset="3456606">It does not assert as out far as we can tell that there were any other brewers who are more likely to enter into the New England market.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.734" offset="3498297">Its essential argument as we understand it, is that it could not enter this market other than by its acquisition of the Narragansett Brewing Company because and this was the basis defining by the District Court, statements made by its executives that it was necessary to secure a strong, viable distribution system to enter the Northeastern market and that kind of system could be obtained only through the acquisition of Narragansett.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.449" offset="3629119">Hence, I think the issue in a large part comes down to the criteria by which one identifies a potential competitor in a given market.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.503" offset="3677393">That is in a sense issue one.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.475" offset="3689305">Second of all, I think it should be pointed out that Falstaff also contends that this market was in fact intensely competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.698" offset="3726190">Now I take it that the relevance of that is that if the market was intensely competitive before the acquisition, intensely competitive after the acquisition, the elimination of the significant potential competitor in and of itself would not materially hold the competition in the marketplace, and hence under those circumstances, we should not be concerned about the question whether Falstaff is such a significant potential competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.449" offset="3837158">Now in general, I don't think after the discussion yesterday we need to review in detail the theory of a potential competition case.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.073" offset="3875715">In essence, it has two parts, one is that the particular firm, the acquiring firm in this instance was in fact likely to enter the market and that this because of the concentrated nature of the market would be pro-competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.189" offset="3944155">That is it is in fact a likely entrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.607" offset="3957844">Second part of the theory says in essence that its presence as a potential competitor is likely to have had an impact on the behavior of firms already in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.051" offset="4011551">And it is that impact which is then eliminated through its entry of a brewer, particularly of the size of this particular firm, Narragansett.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.880" offset="4054915">Indeed, in the cases decided by this Court, dealing with potential competition, there appears to be -- appears to have been more emphasis on the latter than on the former.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.958" offset="4099218">Those cases, the El Paso case, the Penn-Olin case, Procter &amp; Gamble, Ford Motor case decided last term, all emphasize the effect which that particular acquiring firm had on the market even without actual entry, but instead by virtue of its existence, and the phrase which has come to be used is on the wings of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.179" offset="4196080">As it was put in the panel, the existence of an aggressive, well-equipped, and well-financed corporation engaged in the same or related lines of commerce waiting anxiously to enter an oligopolistic market would be a substantial incentive to competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.444" offset="4261177">Now that's the basic theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1124.338" offset="4600769">But what it suggests is a firm which is positioned at a certain point in the market.</text>

            <text syncTime="1138.108" offset="4655835">Now I think so far as what is subjective, what is objective and that is indeed the major part of what we are concerned with in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1220.553" offset="4985605">But so far as the question of entry itself is our belief and we believe the Court has already so indicated that the standard to be applied is whether or not a reasonable management on the facts established would have believed there was a basis for entry if this acquisition had been prohibited.</text>

            <text syncTime="1280.082" offset="5223737">In other words, I think there is a second part to the problem in this case because the testimony which is relied upon by the president of Falstaff in particular, his testimony given in a much later date as to what he would have done or would not have done, what other in the management of Falstaff would or would not have done.</text>

            <text syncTime="1594.464" offset="6481272">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.609" offset="6505827">I have been interested in several of the colloquy between counsel not only in this case but in the preceding case in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.762" offset="6554415">One of my interests lies in the dealing of the Government with the subjective evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.134" offset="6595897">At one point in the briefing of this case, a suggestion seem to me clearly was that my subjective evidence, the Government did not elect to go so far as to say the subjective evidence should not be admitted and indeed they made no objection to the kind of evidence we are talking about at the trial level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.710" offset="6690252">Nonetheless, admissible or not, the Court should not take it into account to any degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.333" offset="6736750">Now, as Mr. Justice Stewart suggest, the Government's attitude would be quite different in the subjective evidence they were thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.791" offset="6774575">Now, we have the same sort of problem in the court below and this is somewhat diverting but it is enlightening, I believe with respect to post-acquisition evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.814" offset="6858585">And on page 195 of the appendix, what trial counsel for the Government says in substance is that in some cases, well this is a quote, “In some cases, post-acquisition evidence showing any competitive effects after an acquisition is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.000" offset="6939355">However, post-acquisition evidence to show what would have been had this particular acquisition not taking place.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.259" offset="6968404">In other words, if the evidence to be introduced was such to show that after an acquisition anticompetitive effects had been felt in the marketplace that would be admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.143" offset="7023992">Judge Day said it would seem that a court common justice would dictate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.723" offset="7038307">The evidence indicated the other way ought to prevent -- permit a defendant to introduce it and (Inaudible) and apply the merge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.858" offset="7086791">Now that's the same matter to the Government has about subjective evidence and let me turn to the subjective evidence and speak upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.993" offset="7151365">While I think the decisions of this Court clearly suggest and I know of no contrary decision that it does not deem its function to retry cases and will not do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.141" offset="7199953">Whether examination is into that question of whether the findings below were clearly erroneous, the discussion have got to run the gamut of significant evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2297.130" offset="9291943">Now, there was a witness who at that time had no acts to grind, nothing at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.173" offset="9320051">He had -- he had been a substantial stockholder in Narragansett.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.967" offset="9347218">And when these acquisitions were consummated, the stockholders in Narragansett walked off with 19 and half million dollars scot-free.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.623" offset="9389850">The District Court refused to enjoin the acquisition before it was consummated and dismissed Narragansett out of this case thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.098" offset="9431751">So at the time Mr. Haffenreffer testified in 1970, there was no possible conflict of interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2344.267" offset="9480443">That is the only piece of evidence in this record concerning the thinking of people in the industry in 1965 about the danger to their position of a possible entry by Falstaff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.559" offset="9545644">They are eliminated as the potential competitor in that aspect of thing by that piece of testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.530" offset="9581484">And the trial judge was of course entitled to accept it as true or rejected as false and he accepted it as true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.382" offset="9628923">With respect to subjective evidence if it is admissible, it is initially at least up to the trier of fact to determine its truth or falsity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.837" offset="9682735">If he finds it true, I suggest he is entitled to find upon the basis of its truth and come to a judgment on the case on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.664" offset="9741981">And unless the Court has changed its mind on the view that it had in Yellow Cab and in Oregon Medical Society, it will be necessary to find that the court below was clearly in error and to be convinced that a serious mistake has been made by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.228" offset="9848247">What the Government is seeking here for all the words they used with respect to incentive to Falstaff to enter this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.692" offset="9898088">What the Government is really seeking is what it sought in Penn-Olin which is the equivalent of an irrebuttable presumption from two things, apparent financial ability and a desire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.225" offset="9960260">The desire does not reach the heights of incentive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.966" offset="9979277">Incentive must have with it in the context of things like this a reasonable anticipation of product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.416" offset="10013027">And there is no showing in this record by the Government of any reasonable anticipation of profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.386" offset="10040926">But they used the word incentive almost as though it were the equal of desire and with respect to the question asked by Mr. Justice Rehnquist, trial counsel for the Government in his opening said that he would show that for a number of years Falstaff have had annoying desire to enter the New England market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.833" offset="10154715">Falstaff had had a desire to enter the New England market for a period of years and had never made any attempt to conceal it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.763" offset="10190451">The question of whether it could profit or probably do it either by independent entry or by a toe-hold series which nobody can yet completely define, chances to profit entry in either of those directions were not acceptable to Falstaff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.312" offset="10268609">And they had decided sometime before not to build a brewery in New England for example, a question which I put to Mr. Griesedieck on page 296 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.355" offset="10336841">After he had told me it was his view and the unanimous view of the executive committee that he'd make no attempt to enter independently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.745" offset="10370382">My question is to pinpoint this to a degree, “Had you ever entertained the idea in a period of time from approximately 1950 on, let's say, of building a brewery in New England?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.918" offset="10419075">The answer was, “No, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.036" offset="10427538">I asked him, “Why not?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.911" offset="10435062">And he told me that the -- there was no distributor system and no observable way to acquire one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.391" offset="10468916">Now, let me speak of the Arthur D. Little Report very briefly because that has been -- it's been suggested if that has some significance with respect to the likelihood entry by Falstaff independently or toe-hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.320" offset="10540701">The Arthur D. Little Report was a result of a study by engineers with respect to certain aspects of Falstaff's future, what they should do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.496" offset="10593364">What markets they should enter?</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.820" offset="10598693">How they should try to enter them?</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.186" offset="10612067">No live witness was called in support of those -- of that report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.867" offset="10630875">I objected to it on the ground that it could not stand by itself before its conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.428" offset="10661073">It was omitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.981" offset="10671313">There is nothing in the record to show whether the people who made the study and compose the report and offer their conclusions and opinions in the report itself had enough expertise to qualify the witness and the report is insignificant because of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.379" offset="10752920">The report did recommend that Falstaff build a brewery in the Baltimore area and Falstaff decided that that part of the report was not valid enough to entertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.588" offset="10825749">The report did recommend attempts to penetrate the Detroit-Chicago market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.041" offset="10851558">Those suggestions Falstaff analyzed on its own basis found they have some merit, tried them out and as I have told you, failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.628" offset="10913834">Now, the critical part of this case is that there is no evidence to support the burden which the Government had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.323" offset="10952704">It certainly -- the Government certainly have to demonstrate on the one hand that there was in fact likelihood of entry which involves ability to finance, desire to entry and a reasonable profitability on penetrating the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.449" offset="11037132">The Government did show desire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.222" offset="11052283">They showed apparent financial ability, they showed nothing about profitability and you cannot tell from the Government's case whether an entry in the -- either in the method which they suggest made any sense to a prudent businessman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.207" offset="11128247">And I think it is -- seems like confident to remember that this was a public company, stock was widely held and there was some danger of concern, objection, and litigation on the part of stockholders if they made more blunders of the same kind that they had apparently made in both Detroit and Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.269" offset="11240469">There is evidence in the record which we produce showing the lack of sense in entering the market in the two names suggested by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.010" offset="11303372">Dr. Horowitz, we call an expert, he testified was not feasible, not possible enough to build a brewery and certainly not feasible without being able to sell the beer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.889" offset="11374947">Mr. Haffenreffer testified that he did not believe that it was possible for Falstaff to acquire a viable, energetic, reliable, distribute organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.595" offset="11433775">He did not believe it was feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.393" offset="11444955">And there are no facts in the record which carry the Government's burden to its appropriate conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.062" offset="11475571">There are facts in the record which clearly justify the trial done in entering judgment for the appellee, if in fact, he found the evidence credible and believed it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3079.952" offset="12423189">Let me address myself to several matters raised in the argument of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.034" offset="12447535">He suggested there was no evidence of apprehension within the New England market on the part of those in the market of the likelihood of entry by Falstaff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.025" offset="12491421">I think it should be indicated, number one, that the testimony of Mr. Haffenreffer which he read to you of course says he did not fear them because of their transportation cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.720" offset="12530291">We are not talking about their entry through transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.785" offset="12550562">But I think more important, there is an impressive list of concerns marketing in New England who contacted this particular brewing company with respect to likelihood of acquisition, not only the majors which are referred to be -- primarily in the brief, but several smaller brewers contacted the Falstaff Brewing Company as a firm whom they believe would be likely to enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.135" offset="12651917">The letters from distributors which are contained in the record, some 20 of them already existing beer distributors simply elude to the rumors in the likelihood that Falstaff was preparing to enter this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.308" offset="12704580">And now it's true there is no testimony by competitors that their conduct was influenced by this individual firm on the edge in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.966" offset="12743241">It is quite clear however they were perceived by those in the industry as a rather likely entry.</text>

            <text syncTime="3181.879" offset="12830908">Well, I think that -- that what Mr. Haffenreffer said as I understand it is that during the time that he was operating the Narragansett brewery he did not fear and as -- maybe I read the statement incorrect, “Shipment into the area by Falstaff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.494" offset="12885347">He puts it specifically in terms of transportation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.922" offset="12899035">Now it maybe that at that point there was no particular likelihood of that sort of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.836" offset="12926725">But I think given the objective facts here with respect to the likelihood of entry and the perception of Falstaff's entry by those in the industry and given the concentrated nature of this market that it is reasonable to conclude that their behavior was affected by this particular firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.329" offset="13012720">Now, I think and let me turn to that issue because we really did not discuss it earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.932" offset="13035081">The second critical finding I think made by the judge and there are some difficulties here because the judge made no detail of findings of fact is that the market was intensely competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.970" offset="13083251">Now, if that is so, presumably the elimination of the significant potential competitor is a very little customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.849" offset="13110732">Nowhere in his opinion does he refer to the fact that this was a concentrated market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.550" offset="13133615">Nowhere does he refer to the fact that that trend was increasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.928" offset="13151065">He accepts primarily the testimony by Falstaff's president, the chief executive officer of Narragansett and the economic expert put on the stand by Falstaff that this was an intensely competitive market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.263" offset="13216475">And the statement by competitors given the concentration and the increasing trend towards the concentration is precisely the kind of testimony given by bankers in the Philadelphia Bank case which the Court said was lay evidence not entitled to particular weight on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.200" offset="13288155">So far as the economist is concern, he conceded his primary argument was that prices had not risen in this market commensurate with cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.201" offset="13324204">He conceded that he had not examined the price and cost data for the New England market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.973" offset="13343222">Now under those circumstances the whole thrust of this Court's opinion in the past has been to look to concentration as the indicator of competition in the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.011" offset="13391391">I think that brings me to conclusion, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3324.220" offset="13400273">Mr. Kauper, let -- let me ask you on more question if I may in your colloquy with Mr. Justice White about the competitor's perception of this potential competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.169" offset="13448025">I take it ultimately that too is a subjective determination isn't albeit on the subjective state of mind of the people in the market already, they must have perceived that being -- rather than just it being a question of a reasonable person in their position being capable of perceiving.</text>
