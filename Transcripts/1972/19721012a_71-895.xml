            <label>Mr. Peter G. Nash</label>
            <text syncTime="131.188" offset="628172">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.070" offset="639666">This case is here on certiorari to the Ninth Circuit which denied enforcement of provisions of the National Labor Relations Board order requiring -- excuse me, requiring the reinstatement of four employees who were engaged in a strike when they were discharged by their employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.125" offset="707897">The question presented here concerns the protection which the National Labor Relations Act affords to employees engaged in a strike against their employer for an economic objective, who are discharged for that activity before they have been permanently replaced by that employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.235" offset="776338">Thus do, such strikers have an unconditional right to reinstatement to their former jobs as the Board found or is that right to reinstatement lost if the employer can show substantial and legitimate business justifications for refusing to reinstate them as the court below found.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.203" offset="848227">The facts may be briefly summarized as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.791" offset="862542">In August 1967, the Teamsters Union commenced an organizing campaign amongst the employees of 10 to 11 moving and storage companies within the Santa Maria, California area including the respondent, International Van Lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.359" offset="916773">On September 21st, the Union that had obtained authorization cards from five of six of International's employees filed a representation petition with the National Labor Relations Board, a copy of which was unserved upon the company and received by it on September 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.789" offset="986572">A week later on October 2nd and 3rd, this Union held meetings at which the Union representatives told the employees that certain companies being organized, including International had withdrawn their consent for an NLRB election.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.603" offset="1053759">There was also some discussion at that time about the discharge of employees of other companies other than -- than International.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.684" offset="1082075">In any event, the assembled employees decided to strike and did so on October 4th.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.711" offset="1106213">Three of International's employees, Dicus, Manuel Vasquez, and Mr. Casillas refused to cross the picket line and the fourth, Robert Vasquez did not report for work that day because of the picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.705" offset="1162219">The president of International, Robert McEwan obtained temporary replacements the next day, October 5th, from his brother who had a similar moving and storage company within the area and sent telegrams to Manuel and Robert Vasquez and Dicus advising them that they had been permanently replaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.595" offset="1233795">Seven days later, on October 12, the Union filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board alleging that Manuel and Robert Vasquez, Casillas, and Dicus had all been discriminatorily discharged in violation of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.807" offset="1302549">Between October 8th and October 28th, Dicus and Manuel Vasquez each asked the president of the company, Mr. McEwan, who was then hospitalized whether each was going to have a job and neither received any commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.032" offset="1359496">Dicus had the same experience shortly after Mr. McEwan left the hospital on October 28th.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.191" offset="1388126">In the latter part of November, Casillas who had prior to that time, a casual worker, asked Mr. McEwan to put him back on the availability list for call.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.653" offset="1430026">He received no particular commitment and he has not or had not at the time of the hearing been recalled to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.753" offset="1458343">On October 12th, Manuel and Robert Vasquez and Dicus asked Mr. McEwan to be reinstated and were refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.964" offset="1487182">The strike continued on at least through the hearing which commenced on April 3, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.782" offset="1514454">The Board found that the company's employees were engaged in a protected strike to compel a consent election and that even if the objected strike was to compel immediate recognition by the company, of the Union, it was a protected strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.564" offset="1573595">Further the Board found that Manuel and Robert Vasquez and Dicus were discharged by the telegram sent on October 5th for as a matter of fact, they had not been permanently replaced at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.924" offset="1623019">And further, that all four employees which includes -- included Casillas, the casual employee, were refused reinstatement upon their unconditional offers or applications for reinstatement which further violated Sections 8 (a) (3) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.109" offset="1691773">The Board ordered reinstatement of all four of these employees even if that reinstatement required the discharge of strike replacements which may or may not had been hired since the time -- since the time of the discharge and the refusal of reinstatement of these employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.057" offset="1771604">The Ninth Circuit found that all four of the employees have been discharged on October 5 for engaging in a protected strike which sought a consent election, but none had been permanently replaced up until that time and that as such, those discharges violated Sections 8 (a) (1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.456" offset="1849240">The Court further found that the three of the strikers excluding Casillas at this point, the casual, made unconditional request for reinstatement which were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.352" offset="1892812">And that Casillas had made a similar request, but because he was a casual employee, was not clear to the Ninth Circuit, whether in fact he had been denied reinstatement or whether there just had not yet been an opportunity for the employer to call him back to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.601" offset="1949759">The Court remanded that latter -- that latter execution to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.889" offset="1966895">However, despite these findings and despite an assumption by the Ninth Circuit, the employees who struck after the discharge of these employees, who continued their strike, might in fact be properly considered to be unfair labor practice strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.762" offset="2022379">The Court held that the discharge strikers remained economic strikers, finding that to be their status at the time they were in fact discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.128" offset="2055920">Accordingly, although these employees had not been replaced when fired, the Court found that they were not entitled to reinstatement if the employer had a legitimate and substantial business justification for refusing to reinstate them which includes the hiring of permanent replacement since the -- since their discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.850" offset="2130735">The Court remanded the case to the Board to make this determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.820" offset="2154663">In argument, I think it might be helpful to discuss initially some of the general principles involved in this area which are not, in my judgment, disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.649" offset="2197922">Thus, there is no dispute between the parties concerning the validity of the consistently recognized distinction between the reinstatement rights of unfair labor practice strikers and economic strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.446" offset="2245151">Unfair labor practice strikers are those who strike activity, either begins and or is prolonged or aggravated of -- by reaction against employer of unfair labor practices and economic strikers are generally everybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.869" offset="2302830">Economic strikers are entitled to reinstatement at the end of their strike unless the employer can show some substantial and a legitimate business justification for failing to reinstate them such as the continuing presence of permanent replacers -- replacements in their jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.357" offset="2364792">The theory here is that although the employer may not discriminate against those strikers, it does have a legitimate interest in operating his business during the strike and may in the balancing of the interest and equities involved obtain permanent replacements for those strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.829" offset="2430725">Unfair labor practice strikers on the other hand are entitled to unconditional reinstatement regardless of the employer's business justification for not reinstating them including the presence of permanent replacements.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.953" offset="2491225">The theory here is that such strikers are acting to protect themselves against the illegal acts of the employer which violate the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.954" offset="2523199">And although the employer can and has a legitimate interest in operating his business during the strike, he may not penalize his employees by permanently replacing them for the action which they've taken really in response to his transgression.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.998" offset="2579414">Further elaborating on the foregoing, it's also clear that a strike that starts as an economic strike may in fact become an unfair labor practice strike, thus conferring the economic strikers and the unfair labor practice strikers where the employer's commission of an unfair labor practice has the effect of prolonging or aggravating a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.487" offset="2653288">And finally and apart from the discussion of unfair labor practice and economic strike of that distinction, I think it is also clear that the discharge of economic strikers for strike absences before they have been permanently replaced is discrimination and violates Sections 8 (a) (3) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.916" offset="2731029">As I say, up to this point, I think there is no disagreement between the respondent, the petitioner nor indeed by the court below.</text>

            <text syncTime="769.936" offset="3183156">The Fleetwood decision of this Court and the ultimate Laidlaw decision of the Board which gives meaning I think to the -- to the Fleetwood.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter G. Nash</label>
            <text syncTime="783.926" offset="3239058">To the extent that Mackay indicated that perhaps an employee could be discharged and his employment status completely eliminated or terminated by -- by reasons of his replacement to the extent of the dicta, what I would call the dicta in that case is different from Fleetwood, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.496" offset="3301334">I think it's implicitly an extension of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.677" offset="3326098">The court below, however, did find in this case that all -- all four of the strikers were discharged before they had been permanent -- permanently replaced, they could not, as a matter of law require any greater reinstatement rights than those of economic strikers, for that was a status that they had held at the time of their discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.022" offset="3399450">And this is true in the Ninth Circuit's view even if those discharges converted the strike in question and the strikers, the non-discharge strikers in the unfair -- into an unfair labor practice strike and then into an unfair labor practice group of strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.883" offset="3462875">I think that the Court's position is erroneous for at least two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.228" offset="3480325">First, wholly apart from whether the four dischargees became unfair labor practice strikers are not, the respondent, because of its action and unlawfully discharging them has an unconditional obligation to reinstate them.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.203" offset="3540198">A classic remedy for an unlawful discharge of an employee is unconditional reinstatement for that's the best way to restore the status quo ante.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.433" offset="3573112">This holds true whether the dischargee was unlawfully discharged from active duty or whether he's unlawfully discharged from a picket line before he had been replaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.139" offset="3611878">In the latter case, the striker not having been replaced at that time -- at the time of his wrongful discharge had an unconditional right to return to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.158" offset="3648031">He was terminated from that position and in order to replace and put things back into status quo, that wrongfully terminated striker should be in the same position that he was in before he was discharged which is the position of an economic striker with an unconditional ability to return.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.414" offset="3716995">Thus, the circuits have uniformly held that without regard to whether the strikes subsequently takes on the nature of a protest against an employer's unfair labor practice, that that employer may not lawfully terminate economic strikers prior to the time they've been validly replaced and that the appropriate remedy therefore is reinstatement even if that requires the displacement of post-firing replacements.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.192" offset="3808110">Just as an employer may not deny reinstatement to an employee unlawfully discharged while he is actively working on the grounds that he subsequently replaced that discharged employee, so too a striking employee can have no less protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.213" offset="3868191">To hold otherwise, I think would be to recognize a distinction between non-strike concerted activities protected by Section 7 on the National Labor Relations Act, and strike activities similarly protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.354" offset="3920750">Congress did not authorize such a distinction to be made and rightly so or no one can deny that the right to legally strike is one of the paramount protected activities under the National Labor Relations Act and indeed Congress so recognized specifically in passing Section 13 of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.623" offset="3985847">Secondly, and contrary to the court below, the Board could properly find that by continuing to strike after their unlawful discharge, the four dischargees in this case became unfair labor practice strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.620" offset="4037883">It is I submit a reasonable inference for the Board to make that the dischargees had added to their protest against their employer, their unlawful discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.203" offset="4092217">And further that the unfair labor practice of firing a striker has such an effect upon a strike is to tend to prolong it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.287" offset="4124505">At the very least, the Board in the exercise of its expertise may, I submit, properly conclude that the discriminatory and unlawful discharge of strikers is so likely to have an impact upon the strike itself that such an act by the employer shifts the burden to that employer to show that the strike was not in fact impacted by the illegal discharges.</text>

            <text syncTime="1624.934" offset="6603107">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.391" offset="6624946">I think the essence of the case before you and the holding of the Ninth Circuit is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.106" offset="6655770">The Ninth Circuit has held for a rule of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.090" offset="6675728">The Ninth Circuit has said, “We will not call an automatic conversion of an economic striker to an unfair labor practice striker without substantial evidence that the unlawful act of the employer has prolonged the strike.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.157" offset="6743960">And I refer the Court to page 34 of our brief on the merits holding from the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.127" offset="6775829">The Court points out in the middle of the page that the Board has made a finding -- the Board has argued that the employer's unfair labor practices substantially prolonged the strike were a significant factor in the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.923" offset="6839045">And then the Court concludes by saying the Board adduces no evidence in support of this necessary effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.544" offset="6873527">We submit that the Ninth Circuit has done no more and no less than say that it will not accept a per se conversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.743" offset="6914382">Because the essence of an unfair labor practice striker is an individual who is on strike protesting the unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.678" offset="6958059">It's a question of cause and effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.242" offset="6972374">And cause and effect must necessarily require evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.418" offset="6993063">Now the Ninth Circuit is not alone with all due respect to the General Counsel, the Ninth Circuit is in the company of the Second Circuit, and the Third Circuit, and the Seventh Circuit, in the Thompson case and the Frick case, and in the Jackson Printing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.069" offset="7075610">Each case the Circuits recognized the cause and effect situation and required evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.465" offset="7113226">I think that the Board has the burden if it is intending to impose a severe restriction of unconditional reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.835" offset="7162755">Approving that the conduct of the employer prolonged the strike and the court below merely said that the economic strikers were on strike for a prior complaint that there was no unfair labor practice strike at the time they went on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.581" offset="7237674">And that the employer's conduct though unlawful may or may not have had a bearing under a continued picket line conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.308" offset="7276648">And I respectfully refer the Court to the fact that the record shows that with the exception of the December 12 request for reinstatement all other request as late as April, a few days before the hearing in the case were predicated and conditioned upon the signing by the employer of a contract, and not any contract but a specific contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="2241.369" offset="9068857">We believe further that to compound this problem, this particular strike had a dual facet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.710" offset="9102190">The Board found ultimately that it was a strike to force the consent and also could have been a strike for recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.517" offset="9149419">I already covered the question of a strike to force a consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.295" offset="9164570">In respect to a strike to force an immediate recognition, I submit to the Court that the failure by the Union to notify the employer in any manner other than by receipt from the employer -- by the employer from the Board of the petition itself and the failure by the Union to comply with the Boards regulations in Section (9) (c) (4) of the Act which requires an allegation in the petition of a demand for recognition and a refusal, that this basic jurisdictional defect in that petition rendered the petition a nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.701" offset="9338128">I think that in the context of the Union's activity here in fabricating and this is a finding by the trial examiner which was not disturbed by the Board or the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.827" offset="9382640">That the Union have fabricated a labor dispute, willfully fabricated a dispute on a non-existent grievance that in the context of that fabrication, the failure to allege in the petition that there was a demand -- that there was a refusal renders that petition fatally defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.323" offset="9472711">And the picketing which continued for more than 30 days was such a fatally defective petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.091" offset="9503744">And our opinion rendered that strike a violation of Section (8) (b) (7) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.293" offset="9524537">And the authorities are quite clear that an employer has no obligation to reinstate any striker who strikes in violation of (8) (b) (7) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.147" offset="9575946">I think that we have a basic question before the Court on the consent and/or recognition issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.927" offset="9603114">And that question is, “Do the processes of the Board prevail?</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.638" offset="9637909">Are they available to the employer in the same fashion that they are available to the employees?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.977" offset="9663300">Is the mandatory language of Congress and Congress didn't say it may, it said shout.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.514" offset="9689422">Is the language of the implementing regulations which says that upon the filing of a petition in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the Board, are they not setup as a condition proceeding to the processing of a valid petition?</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.147" offset="9763924">Or on the alternative, do we say that the right to strike is so powerful, is so important and we do not undermine that right?</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.355" offset="9812825">It is powerful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.213" offset="9816273">It is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.165" offset="9824005">But where is the balance?</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.594" offset="9833723">Do we invite Labor to ignore the Board, not on peripheral issues where on a basic due process -- due process issue, the question of the employer's right to a hearing, I submit that that is what the Court is faced with on the underlying threshold issues which in respondent's view are far more significant, are far more important than the rule of evidence which has been promulgated by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.840" offset="9962768">We can live with a rule of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.330" offset="9972694">A rule of evidence can be interpreted very strictly by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.908" offset="9990980">They give the Board clearly said in this case that the company failed to sustain its burden of proof if it has such a burden that the unfair labor practices did not prolong the strike, I might be able to accept that as a lawyer, but the Board didn't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.996" offset="10075408">The Board urges an automatic per se conversion theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.153" offset="10103933">Notwithstanding the evidence, notwithstanding whether the unfair labor practice occurs one day before the strike, six months before the strike, six months after the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.329" offset="10160671">A per se rule and I believe in the law, especially in the law of labor relations, per se rules are very dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.151" offset="10195989">Much in the practice of labor law and much in our functioning here in labor relations is not so much what the employer does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.830" offset="10226709">It's how he says what he does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.613" offset="10237785">And for example, if an employer says, “I am going to discharge you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.332" offset="10260668">Or, “I'm going to replace you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.676" offset="10270072">There are many -- there are entirely different connotations that the Board could place upon this semantical difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.650" offset="10306017">Basically, these are our three issues, the consent -- a strike to force a consent is not protected activity, and the case decided by the Board do not support that properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.161" offset="10360038">(Inaudible) Your Honors, I would like to comment briefly on Washington Aluminum which is cited by the Board as this Court‘s authority for the fact of a strike for immediate recognition or any protest without notice is still protected activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.674" offset="10430046">I refer the Court to the fact that in Washington Aluminum, there was no labor union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.874" offset="10450840">The employees were not represented and the employees had instant sit down strike based upon working conditions, a cold shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.715" offset="10494203">That is a far cry from International Van where there was a labor union, a petition filed with the Board, and a fabricated reason for the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.447" offset="10541119">I submit that as a further argument for the unprotected nature of these activities is that there was no labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.362" offset="10576854">And I'm well aware of the Mackay language which talks about the wisdom or unwisdom of the employee's activities in going on strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="2752.938" offset="11115081">I believe that under the facts in this case, the one element of Mackay which talks about the mistaken judgment of the employees or the wisdom or unwisdom of going on strike for a reason which is not correct implies good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.800" offset="11194598">I think when you -- when you examine a willful fabrication of a reason to go on strike, the element of a good faith mistake disappears and we open the door to permitting employees or a union -- or a union representing employees to fashion a labor dispute out of thin air anytime they want to bring the conduct within the purview of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.823" offset="11306715">And once again, I believe that Section 2 of the Act says quite clearly or at least implies that the Board has no jurisdiction to inquire into a dispute which is not a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.032" offset="11367528">And there again in my attempt to bootstrap, I would believe that this Court could inquire into a jurisdictional error even if not raised in the court below.</text>
