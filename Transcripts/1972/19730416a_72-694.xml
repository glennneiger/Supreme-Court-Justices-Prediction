            <label>Mr. Leo Pfeffer</label>
            <text syncTime="61.623" offset="349915">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.303" offset="364544">This is a suit challenging the constitutionality of the three parts of Chapter 414 of New York Laws, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.491" offset="421386">That Act consists of five parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.324" offset="436642">Part one provides public funds for the maintenance and repair of non-public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.170" offset="468093">Part two, provides funds for tuition in such schools, of parents whose income does not exceed $5,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.371" offset="532877">Part three provides a tax credits to parents, children taking such schools whose income exceeds $5,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.609" offset="589824">Part four provides public funds to public school districts Impact Aid funds whose enrollment increases by reason of the closing down of nonpublic schools in that district, and part five empowers the public schools districts in those areas to purchase unused or no longer used nonpublic schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.286" offset="704554">The suit challenges only the first three parts under the religion clauses of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.641" offset="729945">The District Court held unanimously that part one and part two are unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.774" offset="770487">By a divided vote, with Judge Hays dissenting, it held constitutional the third part, the tax credit part and also held that, that part was severable from the rest of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.329" offset="836733">Judge Hays dissented on both parts, now taking each of these parts to seriatim, the maintenance and repair part, the statute is quite broad in what constitutes maintenance and repair, indeed it's open ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.208" offset="944253">It defines maintenance and repair as the provision of heat, light, water, ventilation and sanitary facilities; cleaning, janitorial and custodial services; snow removal; necessary upkeep and renovation of buildings, grounds and equipment; fire and accident protection; and such other items as the commissioner, as the state Commissioner of Education may deem necessary to ensure the health, welfare and safety of enrolled pupils.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.833" offset="1114676">Indeed I think it is fair to say that except for teacher salaries, this statute permits practically the state and directs the state to pick up the bill for everything in those schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.437" offset="1201089">Now, the only qualifications under the statute are that the schools be located in low income areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.073" offset="1247692">The amount given to the schools for that purpose is $30 per pupil in attendance and an additional $10.00 if the school is more than 25 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.001" offset="1311326">Now, in Lemon against Kurtzman and Earley against DiCenso, this Court in 1971 declared unconstitutional the state laws in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island which appropriated public funds to pay for the secular teaching in religious schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.346" offset="1436714">On the same day, the Court decided these cases, it decided Tilton against Richardson which upheld on its face, not necessarily as applied, indeed quite clearly not as applied, a Federal statute which appropriated funds to pay half the cost of constructing facilities, colleges.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.664" offset="1538069">Now, in Tilton against Richardson, the plurality opinion, there was no court opinion, distinguished the Federal statute, the add from the statutes in the Pennsylvania and Rhode Island cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.616" offset="1621870">The Court said, in the first place, the federal statute deals with colleges and universities, and there was a rare latitude given by the Establishment Clause, under in such circumstances, because the students are mature, they can resist pressure by the teachers, sectarian pressure in other reasons and therefore the limits of governmental action are somewhat broader, are broader than those in elementary and secondary schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.420" offset="1789053">Secondly, the Court pointed out that we had there a one-time grant in each of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.709" offset="1830222">The money is given to that state whereas in the DiCenso and Lemon cases, there was ongoing payments each year, therefore there was a greater area of governmental involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.270" offset="1912456">Finally, the Court pointed out that in the federal grant, the Tilton grant, the statute specifically forbade the use of any of those facilities partly financed with public funds to be used for religious purposes and indeed in that case, the Court held unconstitutional by unanimously that part of the federal statute which restricted, which removed this limitation after 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.954" offset="2067205">After 20 years under the statute, those federally financed facilities could be used for religious instruction; the Court said this is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.509" offset="2105448">No funds which come from governmental body maybe used to finance any facility used in whole or in part for religious instruction or worship.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.001" offset="2167411">Now, in the present case, the statute applies to elementary and secondary schools not to colleges.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.240" offset="2224358">Moreover it is not a one-time-grant, but it's -- you have to renew it each year, and perhaps above all, the statute does not forbid the use of the facilities so financed governmental funds for religious or sectarian purposes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="560.109" stopTime="561.747">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="560.109" offset="2343790">You are speaking now of part one aspect?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leo_pfeffer" startTime="561.747" stopTime="859.147">
            <label>Mr. Leo Pfeffer</label>
            <text syncTime="561.747" offset="2350373">Part one, part one.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.078" offset="2363643">The same rooms which are financed, whose lighting, whose ventilation whose upkeep, whose renovation, is financed with state funds are used for sectarian instruction and religious worship.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.157" offset="2443995">If that was a chapel in school as many of the schools to have chapels, that chapel too is part of the cost of maintenance and repair borne by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.286" offset="2508466">The statute provides that only 50% of the average state cost of maintenance and repair of public schools maybe appropriated towards these schools, and in no case more than 100 % of money is actually used for these purposes in the parochial schools maybe used.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.469" offset="2601253">But there is no distinction within the statute between those parts of the bill indeed it's questionable whether it could be, but those parts of building used for religious purposes and those for sectarian purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.292" offset="2652557">Now I do not believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.394" offset="2664991">And in fact as I read the briefs, there is I believe an implicit admission that if this statute applied to all nonpublic schools, it would clearly be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.264" offset="2728417">I don't see how it can be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.324" offset="2740642">There was an effort to justify the statute on the police power of the state to provide for safety and health of students.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.985" offset="2791320">While the police power has to be exercised within the restrictions of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.528" offset="2825488">In Flast against Cohen, this Court held that there is an express provision in the constitution, the First Amendment forbidding governmental financing of parochial schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.198" offset="2884211">I do not know of any case in which a court has held that where there is an express provision in the constitution that can't be transgressed under the police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.138" offset="2935933">The police power of the state is inherent.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.299" offset="2948577">It is used to -- the word police, it's origin is the use of security and safety for people, to arrest criminals or those who are charged with crime and to try them, convict them, and punish them, but that doesn't mean that it's the police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.553" offset="3029556">A state can't violate an express prohibition against double jeopardy let us say or trial without jury or trial without counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.886" offset="3062888">Surely the police -- the public has an interest, the state has an interest in the education of children, but it must be exercised in such way that it does not follow a specific prohibition of the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.705" offset="3122239">No matter how wise, no matter how effective a trial without jury, or double jeopardy, or trial without counsel would be in preventing crimes speaks, that cannot stand, that cannot justify a specific prohibition in the constitution in the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.198" offset="3216175">And, in fact, in Cole the whole base of the decision was that the statute clause is a specific prohibition, the first prohibition in the Bill of Rights against a financing of the operations of parochial schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.336" offset="3284720">The state seems to, also indeed clearly bases its position on this, in this part that this statute is limited to schools in low-income areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.993" offset="3363297">Again, I know of no decision of any Court holding that to be a critical, or relevant constitutional question, where the question is Equal Protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.862" offset="3414810">If the state chooses a certain class as beneficiaries of its action and excludes other classes as for example, if the state provides free counsel in criminal case which indeed it must, to poor people but not to wealthy people or provide free access to the divorce cases, indeed it must for poor people not to wealthy people or other cases it does not provides the transcripts of criminal trial to put but not the wealthy people.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="859.147" stopTime="861.039">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="859.147" offset="3539989">To poor people as to indigents.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leo_pfeffer" startTime="861.039" stopTime="1373.021">
            <label>Mr. Leo Pfeffer</label>
            <text syncTime="861.039" offset="3547512">Indigents, the indigents.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.992" offset="3563290">If the state -- then quite clearly this would not -- this is a rational classification not quite like the Equal Protection but the state could constitutionally provide free access with divorce courts, to faculty courts, to free transcripts, to public defense service, to all, to the indeed, it does in public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.760" offset="3674363">Public schools are open to everybody, the wealthiest as well as the most poor, and it is not a violation of Equal Protection because of the reasonable classification whether, if the state chooses one alternative free for all or the other type of free only for the poor, the indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.808" offset="3742595">But that never has been used to say that the state can violate an express provision of the Bill of Rights where individual who are involved where they cannot violate it, where the (Inaudible) to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.731" offset="3814275">So, it seems to me that the first -- the unanimous decision of the court below is entirely correct, that it is a violation of the Establishment Clause for the state to provide funds for the maintenance and repair of schools which are used in part at least for religious education or religious question.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.146" offset="3943946">The only case which can remotely justify this statute and very remotely, is the Everson case in which the Court upheld the constitutionality of paying, reimbursing parents for the expenses of sending their children on public bus to parochial schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.010" offset="4067453">Mr. Justice Black for majority of the Court stated that the purpose of this law is to protect the children from the hazards of the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.087" offset="4127744">Well, we do not deny, we cannot deny because the of prior decision of this Court which seem to take a position that you cannot go behind what the legislative state in its declaration of purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.222" offset="4196289">Therefore we must assume that the purposes of this statute the same, but the effect is probably different, you do not teach religion or practice religion on the bus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.361" offset="4256789">If you did, if a private owned bus, in Everson it was a publicly owned bus, system parents got, paid back for the money which they paid for transportation of public bus but if you did under McCollum against Board of Education, going way back to 1948 which held that no premises publicly owned, publicly financed can be used for religious teaching or religious worship even for as much as a half an hour or an hour a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.034" offset="4375489">If it does that, it is unconstitutional, that is what the Court held in McCollum and of course it held the same thing in Engel against Vitale, the prayer case, in Abington Township involving Bible reading and in Lemon against Kurtzman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.050" offset="4451558">So we believe that this part of the statute, part one, was quite properly held unconstitutional by unanimous vote of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.756" offset="4506415">Part two deals with tuition payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.724" offset="4538284">The statute provides that up to 50 % of the tuition of the -- no, I believe it does have -- but the basic provision is that $50.00 is paid per child for the tuition up to no more than the tuition actually is -- for the tuition paid for enrollment in nonpublic schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.513" offset="4709439">The question of tuition grants is not a new one, unlike the maintenance and repair and tax credits which are quite new which appear to be a recent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.980" offset="4767326">Tuition grants has a means of avoiding constitutional limitations goes back at least a century.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.548" offset="4793553">It has been challenged in the Court in three different contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.446" offset="4817168">First, is a violation of state constitutional provisions against financing parochial schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.830" offset="4846738">Second, under the Establishment clause of the First Amendment and third under the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in a racial segregation context, a decision growing out of state appropriations of public funds to pay for the tuition of pupils in racial segregated schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.123" offset="4967842">Now, my own research and I am not volunteering that it is an exhaustive, indeed as I have indicated a moment, I did overlooked one case fortunately which would support to my position not oppose, but the research I have done has disclosed not a single decision and there were many, many which considered this question, not a single decision holding that there was a constitutional difference between a direct grant of public funds to religious schools and paying whole or part of the tuition of children attending those schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.080" offset="5139728">The cases -- some of the cases there are many others, supporting my position are in my brief, both on the -- under the state constitutions Establishment Clause and the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.494" offset="5221334">In the (Inaudible) cases decided both before and after the Lemon, DiCenso cases, there were three, I point out three in my brief, there is actually a fourth one, I must, I say overlooked things, I argued the case but it slipped my memory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.599" offset="5305762">There were four cases in which the US district courts, in each case a three-judge Court passed upon the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.194" offset="5344110">One was Wolman against Essex in Ohio which this Court affirmed without argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.228" offset="5376293">The other is this case, the third is the case which will be argued day after this one, Lemon against Kurtzman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.142" offset="5419969">The fourth which I did not cite in my brief as I said which I slipped my memory is Lemon against Sloan, where -- I mean it's Nebraska against Missouri, Nebraska against Missouri where District Court in Missouri was faced with a challenge by parents of children in parochial schools to the state constitution and the state practice of excluding parochial schools from governmental financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.589" offset="5537729">The parents claimed that this is a violation of religious freedom and Equal Protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.869" offset="5566882">The suit was started before the decision in Lemon against DiCenso.</text>

Long before there was general acknowledgment of need for universal formal education, the religion quotes specifically firmly fix the right to free exercise of religious beliefs, but trusting this fund more right was unequally framed, even if equally framed, even if that's explicit, prohibition against the statute venue religion by government.</text>

            <text syncTime="3023.636" offset="12197909">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.315" offset="12216613">Question of perspective here, we think that the validity, constitutional validity of the statute here at issue, revolves not solely around the precise language of the statute, but the intent and purpose with which the New York State Legislature enact them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.977" offset="12299264">The legislature in 1972 undertook to meet certain specific needs of children attending non-public schools and their parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.858" offset="12334791">It was confronted with a growing clamor for tax relief on the part of parents who paid tuition in the non-public schools on behalf of their children and who also additionally support public schools in the form of tax payments, was faced with the problem of increasing safety hazards in non-public schools which particularly in low income areas, have been unable to meet the cost of maintenance and repair essential to health and safe structures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.316" offset="12444609">Further, the state had become increasingly cognizant of the problem faced by low income parents in paying the tuition necessary to the selection of a non-public school education for their children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.600" offset="12493824">And finally and while not directly relevant to this appeal and still part of the same legislative enactment, in those areas where the financial crisis in the non-public schools had forced their closing, the public schools had been faced with increased cost of education in general and particularly in the cost of additional physical space for the increasing enrollments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.022" offset="12591417">Consequently, in an attempt to meet or impart to alleviate what the District Court here indeed recognized were basically secular problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.589" offset="12629765">The legislature, the state of New York adopted Chapter 414 of the Laws of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.906" offset="12654947">Now, I will address myself initially in this argument to the problem with which Mr. Pfeffer left off that of the income tax portion of the legislation, then to health and safety grants and finally to that portion of the statute relating to the tuition reimbursement to low income parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.285" offset="12736554">The tax portion of the statute provides not for a tax credit but for a modification of adjusted gross income for the purposes of New York determining the New York state income tax payable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.690" offset="12794128">For New York State income tax purposes, the adjusted gross income is the same on both the Federal and state returns with the exception of a number of state modifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.765" offset="12842402">There are additional modifications of gross income which are provided solely in state law and not under the Federal tax returns.</text>

            <text syncTime="3734.555" offset="15041599">The Court recognized the fact that by the time the parent’s income tax liability is fixed and determined, and when he files his returns, his tuition has long since been paid and that any benefit he gets out of this reduction and the eventual reduction of the tax which would be most likely pocketed by him and used for his own personal purposes rather than turned over to the school.</text>

            <text syncTime="3960.467" offset="15945226">I am sure their parents would disagree with that but that was a legislative philosophy behind it. Getting to Section 1 of the statute, the so-called health and safety grants, the legislature specifically found that the financial crisis of non public schools in low income areas have resulted in deferred maintenance and repair programs and it had also resulted in an increase in health and safety hazards to the children attending those schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.430" offset="16077093">Hereto, the District Court in this case found that the conditions and problems set forth in the legislative findings were valid and expressed a secular legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.493" offset="16121396">The bill provides, as Mr. Pfeffer said for a specific dollar amounts per pupil with an additional dollar amount for pupils attending schools in buildings constructed prior to 1947 and would be paid to the schools as a partial reimbursement for prior expenditures for repairs and maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4024.265" offset="16200391">The expenditure of the money we submit is safeguard in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="4028.720" offset="16218258">First, the amount may not exceed 50% of the state wide average cost of maintenance repair in the public schools and may not exceed the actual amount paid by the non-public school in the preceding base year.</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.497" offset="16277400">Further, not all non-public schools were qualified for grants under this program.</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.838" offset="16298715">Only those schools will qualify which have been certified as serving a high concentration of low income pupils for the purposes of Title IV from the Federal Higher Education Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="4061.007" offset="16347408">Title IV involves the specific grants to a teacher to read and teach for educational purposes for persons and educational institutions who are preparing for teaching, who will agree to teach in low income areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.123" offset="16415848">The schools involved in this will be approximately some 250 out of 1400 non public schools in the state of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="4087.676" offset="16454092">In perspective, we must observe that this Court has never held at all direct payments to non-public schools were unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="4096.607" offset="16489827">Now you must also state that there is a long tradition of federal as well as state aid to the non-public schools in the form of special benefits and direct payments to either the schools or their students.</text>

            <text syncTime="4120.636" offset="16585958">We cite many other instances in our brief on this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.241" offset="16608319">It must be assumed that the payments and benefits so provided had been considered not to aid religion but rather to have some other public and secular purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4136.725" offset="16650324">The statute here at issue we submit was adopted in the exercise of the state’s police power to protect the health and safety of children of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4145.818" offset="16686686">Contrary to the argument Mr. Pfeffer seem to advance, we do not consider and we do not complete with the Court’s decisions have ever considered that the police power was directly related to what we normally consider as crime policing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.038" offset="16743528">Police power has had its purpose and activity in various fields of health and safety far beyond the normal criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4176.629" offset="16809880">The latitude which has been inscribed to the police power by the Courts is very great.</text>
            <text syncTime="4181.640" offset="16829942">This Court has indeed held that the state has a sovereign right to protect the welfare of its people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4187.434" offset="16853138">And while most of the cases cited in our brief relate to regulatory statutes adopted in an exercise of the police power, we submit that there is no essential, legal or constitutional difference between statutes which regulate and statutes which provide money to accomplish the desired police power purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4206.989" offset="16931297">In fact, the Everson case, as Mr. Pfeffer said, we submit supports this because this Court in Everson upheld bus transportation on the basis that as a police power measure, designed to get children safely to non-public schools to protect them from the hazards of, as this Court said of either hitchhiking, walking a high-rise.</text>

            <text syncTime="4653.791" offset="18718490">Before lunch, Justice Stewart asked the question concerning the ADC payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4660.158" offset="18743986">New York State as the Court may be aware has the flat grant system of payment to ADC to welfare recipients, but prior to that time, prior to the time that the flat grant system was introduced, where there were categorical grants for various things such as rent, heat, food allowances, clothing allowances and so forth, the state education law required payments for the educational expenses of children and this was interpreted to include not only tuition to non-public schools, but also the expenses of books, clothes which would include uniforms for non-public schools, educational supplies and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4701.544" offset="18909497">And since the flat grant option, the pressure increased upon the legislature for the benefit of the low income parents were directly related to the fact that they no longer were getting this assistance which they had in the past for the purpose of tuition, reimbursement as well as other expenses of children attending non-public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="4724.581" offset="19001657">Along with that and there has been additional feeling within the legislature that the -- since low income parents as well as upper income parents have a constitutional right to send their children to non public schools, that they should not be deprived of this right solely because of their lack of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="4747.036" offset="19091519">We have equated this to some degree with the welfare system, with the provision of low income housing, with the state’s provision of certain benefits in the way of transcripts of administrative hearings and so forth to persons who have low income or who are poverty stricken.</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.218" offset="19176260">To this extent we submit that the low income portion of the statute was itself intended not to benefit the schools, it is paid to the parents long after the tuition has been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4782.003" offset="19231431">It is not -- they are not used as a conduit for the payment to the schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="4943.564" offset="19877595">I am here representing two groups of parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4948.686" offset="19898075">One, are parents with taxable incomes of less than $5000.00 who are eligible for tuition refund under Section 2 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4962.809" offset="19954604">The other group of parents have adjusted gross incomes of less than $35000.00 and are eligible for the tax modification provided in Sections 3 through 5 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4979.447" offset="20021164">The emphasis that I want to make from the start is that this statute is aimed to help parents, not schools and that we represent parents who are directly affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4992.389" offset="20072887">Now what kind of figures are we talking about?</text>
            <text syncTime="4994.318" offset="20080619">I realize from questions this morning that the percentage one or the other is not of particular importance, but we are talking now about the children in New York State who go to non-public schools and there are about 750,000 of them as compared to about 3,200,000 public school.</text>
            <text syncTime="5018.369" offset="20176854">The 750,000 non-public school children attend schools of all categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="5026.847" offset="20210709">The only requirement of the school is that it should give a satisfactory education in secular subjects and that it should not discriminate on the race and so on as indicated in what Mrs. Coon just said.</text>

            <text syncTime="5054.917" offset="20323035">There are a total of something around 2000 such schools in New York State and the figures roughly are that about 1400 of them are affiliated with the Catholic Church.</text>
            <text syncTime="5067.141" offset="20371937">300 or a little more are affiliated with I think some dozen or more other religious bodies, the largest one next to the Catholic Church is the Jewish Schools and about 300 more are non-religiously affiliated, total of about 2000, they are accounting for 750,000 children.</text>
            <text syncTime="5090.015" offset="20463470">And while I am on the subject which has been injected again and again, I want in some of these cases, I want to correct second misapprehensions as to what the Catholic school at least is or is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5106.041" offset="20527522">It is not a school for rich or medium well-to-do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5114.051" offset="20559600">It is increasingly becoming a school of the poor and of minority races.</text>
            <text syncTime="5119.539" offset="20581543">The figures show that in New York City alone, there are 70,000 families with children in Catholic schools who are -- have incomes at or near the poverty level.</text>
            <text syncTime="5137.445" offset="20653119">The figures show that Catholic elementary schools in the Bronx and Manhattan have 31,000 non-white children attending out of 65,000 total.</text>
            <text syncTime="5153.170" offset="20716022">More than 60% of the children in catholic schools in Manhattan are black or Spanish speaking and over 30% in the Bronx.</text>

            <text syncTime="5163.871" offset="20758862">That would be, as a matter of this fact, that would be largely the Puerto Rican community, would it?</text>

            <text syncTime="5169.657" offset="20781955">Well, New York has a rather large Spanish other than Puerto Rican community, rest of Latin America and from Spain itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="5177.344" offset="20812779">Yes, the others would be primarily Puerto Rican.</text>
            <text syncTime="5185.450" offset="20845171">And now, the statute comes before you with very strong legislative findings as to each of the Sections involved and the statute recognized the burdens that are now being borne by parents who send children to accredited non-public schools who read the state of that tax burden, under Section 2 to 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="5212.175" offset="20952064">Concentrating first on the tax, on the tuition reimbursement, the character is that the requirements for admission to that ballpark are that you should have an income of less than 25 -- income of less than -- taxable income of less than $5000.00, that you should have children in a non-public school, that you shall have paid tuition for having them there and the tuition, as Mrs. Coon pointed out, the tuition that is ultimately reimbursable can in no case exceed half what was actually paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="5254.027" offset="21119457">It is half what was actually paid or $50.00 per annum for elementary school pupil, $100.00 per annum for high school pupil.</text>
            <text syncTime="5263.724" offset="21158222">I mentioned that because with all respect I think Mr. Pfeffer misquoted this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="5267.251" offset="21172328">He said that you could get up to the full amount of tuition which you cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="5276.070" offset="21207646">On the tuition reimbursement provision, the trial Court found that there was a good secular legislative purpose and the effect is actually, we submit, neither to the grants nor to inhibit religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5291.958" offset="21271176">It's the nature of pluralistic society to see that all segments of the society have a right to mature and develop and be adequately represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="5304.344" offset="21320704">New York, with its tradition of over 200 years of a single system of education, both public and private, under the Board of Regions has always laid stressed on promoting plurality and diversity and the refund, as I have emphasized is for the benefit of parents, it goes to parents only.</text>
            <text syncTime="5336.045" offset="21447555">There is no question of a conduit here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5340.095" offset="21463751">Parent has his child in the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="5342.476" offset="21473259">To get him in, he has to pay tuition at the beginning of the year, he pays it and he is parted with that money.</text>
            <text syncTime="5348.881" offset="21498859">Some months later, after he has filled out the necessary forms, he gets back from the state a check representing a small fraction of what he may have paid to the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="5364.064" offset="21559672">He does not -- that's his money, he has already paid the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="5368.309" offset="21576600">There is no connection between the two of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5370.480" offset="21585272">It is perfectly open to that parent to say I don’t like this school any longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5374.721" offset="21602304">I won’t bring my child back next year, I’ll take him out.</text>
            <text syncTime="5379.742" offset="21622366">And it is all right for him to say “I’ve got $50.00 here from the state, it is a win for all, I will go spend it at the races.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5386.943" offset="21651101">Or if he is feeling more charitable, he will say to his wife, “In lieu of the price of steaks, I am going to give you this money, you can go downtown and buy a good nice steak to celebrate with.”</text>

            <text syncTime="5431.425" offset="21829047">There was discussion this morning of the G.I. Bill of Rights as an example of this tuition business.</text>
            <text syncTime="5437.657" offset="21854020">I could -- we have listed in our brief various other similar items such as the region scholarship and the scholar incentive programs in New York State and I shall develop those further.</text>
            <text syncTime="5454.090" offset="21919744">As to entanglement, this tuition refund requires a minimum of entanglement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5463.988" offset="21959346">There must be a verification the children are actually enrolled at schools, no entanglement there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5470.415" offset="21985050">A verification that tuition has been paid, then a verification that the individual in question is not telling different stories to the people to whom he is asking for the tax refund and the tax authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5484.476" offset="22041266">In other words, if he says he has an income of $4972 they were checked with the Federal Tax Commission, the State Tax Commission to see if that is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5497.608" offset="22093824">Turning now to the brief moments left to the tax relief business.</text>
            <text syncTime="5502.783" offset="22114513">We have discussed in our brief the question of tax credit versus tax exclusion versus tax deduction and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5510.672" offset="22146069">A typical tax credit is the $12.50 that every New York resident is entitled to take off of his income tax after he figures it all out, and he figures that he has to owe $483.97 and then just for being a taxpayer, he is allowed a flat cancellation of $12.50 of that money whether he is a millionaire or whether he is a pauper.</text>
            <text syncTime="5537.140" offset="22251917">That is an example of a tax credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5539.475" offset="22261321">Tax exemption, I think, the best example is what Your Honor has held in Walls namely, a particular person or institution who just doesn't have to pay any taxes or doesn't have to pay a particular category of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5550.879" offset="22306879">This is just what the statute describes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5552.947" offset="22315133">It is a tax modification and it comes off as Mr. Justice Stewart observed, it comes off the top rather than from the bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="5565.055" offset="22363617">Section 5 comes to the Court with this strong legislative finding which I am going to read.</text>
            <text syncTime="5574.842" offset="22402696">Such educational institutions, that refers to all the institutions covered by the Act, religious and non-religious, such educational institutions not only provide education for the children attending them, but by their existence relieve the taxpayers of the state of the burden of providing public school education for those children.</text>
            <text syncTime="5594.455" offset="22481168">That finding was adopted almost ipsissimis verbis in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5607.795" offset="22534562">As with the tuition reimbursement, I emphasize that this is only partial relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5614.352" offset="22560789">The beneficiary is the parent and not the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="5617.495" offset="22573328">There is no grant from the treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5620.527" offset="22585448">There is a secular intent, namely equity and the benefit is not through, if any to religious schools that are so remote as to are not to involve them permissible entanglement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5632.381" offset="22632887">And there is a minimum amount of administrative entanglement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5636.159" offset="22648038">All those were specifically spelled out by the District Court, as reasons for sustaining the constitutionality of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5649.301" offset="22700596">I don't think I need to say, repeat that the state has wide authority in classifications, in tax things and there is no person that I know of for holding this unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="5665.424" offset="22765066">The District Court said, in holding that their secular purpose as well as the facts were strong, the lightening of the tax burden of those who contribute to public education while deriving no benefit from it for themselves, albeit this is a voluntary choice, is a legitimate legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="5688.460" offset="22857226">I accordingly request, Your Honors that the judgment of the District Court be reversed as to tuition refund section and that section be held constitutional and that the judgment of the District Court as to the tax modification be affirmed and that likewise be held constitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="5756.991" offset="23131303">It requires that the legislature provide for a system of free schools wherein all the children of the state may be educated.</text>

            <text syncTime="5794.972" offset="23283231">The cost of the state of educating the 750,000 nonpublic school is virtually non-existent.</text>

            <text syncTime="5901.175" offset="23708087">To fulfill its responsibility in the public sector, the state contributes cash grants and aids.</text>
            <text syncTime="5907.729" offset="23734314">General cash assistance on a per capita basis on a formula derived through weighted average attendance is the primary form.</text>
            <text syncTime="5916.748" offset="23770363">Faced with the crisis in the public schools and mindful of their responsibility for the education of all children, including the children in the nonpublic schools, the legislature enacted the program which is here under review.</text>
            <text syncTime="5932.150" offset="23832012">They determined that it was in the public interest and that it was important that not only the nonpublic school system of education New York continue to exist but that there be available a plurality of educational opportunity in New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="5948.327" offset="23896691">When talking about the children in nonpublic schools, we are talking about New York State citizens, about our own children.</text>
            <text syncTime="5954.863" offset="23922813">So just as we provide for cash assistance on a per capita aid basis in the public schools, the legislature responded by overwhelming proportions in the private sector by enacting a program of moderate, minimal and varied assistance to low income children and their parents and to middle income parents and to support their voluntary effort in education.</text>
            <text syncTime="5981.724" offset="24030229">This is not a special isolated program, it's part of the general program of assistance to education by New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="5990.163" offset="24063979">Indeed, it would seem that if New York State was so determined, it could have quit itself of its educational responsibility by total grant and aid assistance to all of the parents, both public and nonpublic.</text>
            <text syncTime="6003.722" offset="24118209">If that be the case and allow those parents to determine what schools they wanted to send their children, whether it's public or private, if that be the case, it would appear that New York, having made its choice of its machinery or mechanism to strike down the nonpublic sector would be to put form before substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6026.167" offset="24208071">New York’s minimal program of aid reflects the appropriate and the required governmental neutrality toward religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6033.258" offset="24236387">It neither governmentally establishes a religion nor governmentally interferes with the religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6038.815" offset="24258644">Our task in enacting the Omnibus Act was we felt to reach that neutral ground between the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="6048.034" offset="24295528">The New York program does not encourage attendance at nonpublic schools, indeed in any of event, it's going to be more costly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6057.080" offset="24331682">The state is simply not involved in the parent’s choice of what school the parents chooses for their children.</text>
            <text syncTime="6064.926" offset="24363029">While the program may enhance the ability of a parent to exercise his choice of which school his child would attend, it is nevertheless completely neutral in that it does not favor religion over non-religion, it does not sponsor a particular sect nor does it try to encourage participation in or abnegation of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6086.688" offset="24450173">The question of whether or not a distinction should be made for programs of aid to poverty area schools and to low income parents should distinguish it from an overall program.</text>
            <text syncTime="6100.002" offset="24503359">In enacting legislation, it was felt strongly that a program of aid of health and welfare grants to low income impoverished areas which had certain restrictions did fall within the welfare assistance benefit program and should be considered as a welfare benefit program.</text>
            <text syncTime="6122.451" offset="24593220">These restrictions are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="6125.088" offset="24603773">The schools to be benefited incidentally about 280 out of the total 2,000 nonpublic schools are benefited by Section 1, the schools to be benefited must be schools which have a substantial proportion of children attending whose parents receive ADC.</text>

            <text syncTime="6388.144" offset="25655986">Section 612 (c) of the New York State Tax Law provides for some 15 or 16 modifications.</text>

            <text syncTime="6430.195" offset="25824110">The purpose of this was that we would benefit the parent who is benefiting the state by their voluntary effort in the nonpublic or private school arena and we are doing it on the first level so that we benefit the parent before it becomes involved in any other types of upstate moneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="6453.539" offset="25917524">Finally, I would suggest that on the question of the modification of tax income, the Court looked to the decision of the majority below upholding the modification program where it points out that it does not involve a subsidy, or grant this money from the state treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="6474.296" offset="26000593">It has a particular secular intent, one of equity to give some recompense by way of tax relief to our citizens who bear their share with the burden of maintaining the public schools and who because of religious belief or otherwise send their children to nonpublic full time schools as is their constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="6490.813" offset="26066631">The benefit to the public appropriate schools, if any, is so remote so as not to involve impermissible financial aid to church schools and lastly there is a minimum administrative entanglement with the nonpublic schools nor is ongoing political activity likely to cause division on strictly religious lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="6508.418" offset="26137057">It was our intent to reach the neutral point between the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause and we submit that the judgment of the Court below with regard to the health and safety grants be reversed with regard to the tuition reimbursement be reversed with regard to the tax modification be affirmed.</text>
