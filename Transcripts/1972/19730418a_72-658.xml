            <text syncTime="9.226" offset="140309">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.736" offset="158281">This is an appeal from the three-judge District Court in the Eastern District of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.849" offset="190777">This case involves the liquor licenses of three bars in the City of Racine and six bars in the City of Kenosha.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.274" offset="236440">Kenosha is a city of about 70,000 or more on the border of Wisconsin and Illinois, just north of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.884" offset="282937">Racine is the city of about 90,000 to 95,000 just a few miles north of Kenosha.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.231" offset="324315">This appeal is from a judgment holding that Wisconsin’s statutes which permit legislative hearings in liquor license renewals and original granting are in violation of a due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.358" offset="392756">The Court said that insofar as those statutes permit the denial of the renewal of licenses, granting of licenses without a judicial type hearing, the statutes violate the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.728" offset="486275">The judgment is so broad against these two cities that when the licensing year which is approaching arrives, these cities are enjoined from denying any renewals.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.439" offset="581151">A motion is pending before the three-judge Court to modify that, but is un-acted upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.961" offset="623261">I would like to take the Court back through our liquor licensing regulations in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.659" offset="658056">We have what may be compared to the old town meeting type of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.718" offset="698284">Since the Twenty-first Amendment, we permit what we call local option.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.885" offset="734960">That means that each of the over 7,000 local municipalities in Wisconsin have the authority to grant or not to grant licenses for the sale of beer or intoxicating liquor or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.415" offset="816985">This is a legislative grant to these municipalities and at the present time about a 150 municipalities do not permit the total package.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.110" offset="899845">There are some that permit beer, of course, the majority permit beer and liquor but there are some that permit neither.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.602" offset="965778">Now, these cities, towns and villages are the ultimate authority in our state to determine whether or not beer and intoxicating liquor would be served within their borders.</text>

            <text syncTime="2032.596" offset="8233775">I would submit that that is not a correct statement of the situation and I would refer the Court specifically to page 55 of the Appendix which contains a statement of the summary judgment order of the District Court which indicates that the municipalities are free to act on the applications at such time that their actions are commensurate with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3091.723" offset="12470314">First of all, I think it is implied by the very fact that the state statutes require that licenses can only be renewed, if reasons are -- are not renewed, excuse me, can only be denied if there are reasons given by the municipality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.895" offset="12546905">Secondly, the record also indicates that there were some 154 to 159, I believe, applications to renew licenses before the municipality and in only six situations, the six appellees in this case, were those applications denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.094" offset="12611793">So, there is more or less I would submit a common law situation or an implied situation that licenses will be renewed unless the cause is shown by the municipality.</text>

            <text syncTime="3182.252" offset="12832371">Going back to the definition of liberty under the Roth decision, I would submit that it should also be borne in mind that because these individuals and the accusations against them consisted of allegations of criminal tight conduct, immoral influence on minors and juveniles in the community, quite clearly this brings this case within the language of Roth that these are the types of allegations which affect a person’s liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.652" offset="12961938">And more importantly, these are the types of allegations which attribute bad moral character to the license holders and by state statute once again, a critical eligibility factor for getting a license is that you must be a person of good moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.647" offset="13033932">I would submit that the allegations therefore, are in effect, makes these license holders ineligible for renewal or ineligible to hold a license anywhere else in the state of Wisconsin because they have been branded as persons of bad moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.443" offset="13109164">So, that's the other aspect of liberty which we would submit has been affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.597" offset="13133720">Just because these tavern keepers who run legitimate businesses as tavern keepers choose to have burlesque type entertainment or topless or nude dancing on their premises does not necessarily imply that they, in any way, have permitted a prostitution on their premises or that they have permitted minors on their premises and have imposed immoral influences on juveniles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.706" offset="13246151">And these were the allegations that were labeled against them and these are the allegations which, under Roth, they should have a right to answer and counter.</text>
