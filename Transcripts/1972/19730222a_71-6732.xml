            <label>Mr. Glenn Zell</label>
            <text syncTime="33.519" offset="237484">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.672" offset="250023">This is -- this case involves the re-sentence of a man to a higher sentence from retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.759" offset="274369">In the first trial Mr. Chaffin was indicted and convicted of robbery by open force and violence, received a sentence of 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.221" offset="308224">I was then appointed to appeal his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.102" offset="319822">I appealed to the Georgia Supreme Court and I raised one issue that of the -- an instruction involving the putting the burden of proving of alibi of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.754" offset="358379">It was affirmed, Thereafter it went to Federal District Court and in the lead case in Georgia, the alibi instruction in Georgia was struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.203" offset="392234">Now, Mr. Justice Black might be more familiar with the alibi instruction in Iowa when he was on the Eight Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.350" offset="412818">He struck down a similar instruction in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.162" offset="423999">The state did not appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.672" offset="434030">Mr. Chaffin then was tried again on the same charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.469" offset="449285">The evidence was exactly the same and I like to draw in this point for just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.402" offset="468929">At the second trial, I was ordered to represent him in his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.482" offset="497351">I decided to add the defense of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.310" offset="508635">I felt it was -- it involved with this particular person.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.185" offset="524100">The evidence as to the crime was exactly the same, one eye witness, the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.742" offset="546356">One other witness who thought he couldn’t identify Mr. Chaffin but a man who resembled him.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.158" offset="576031">The extra evidence that the Fifth Circuit in the decision points out and the state points out in their brief is that a psychologist and a psychiatrist were called to the stand to testify for and against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.197" offset="624201">I called a psychiatrist who said he thought he had a mental disorder.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.414" offset="641024">The State called the psychiatrist to say he didn’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.339" offset="656697">The State also called a few witnesses to testify as to the man’s appeared to be a rational prior to the crime, that was the extra evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.042" offset="691493">No extra evidence related to the crime at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.541" offset="701524">The jury then came back with the sentence of life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.597" offset="717720">A substantial increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.870" offset="726810">Now let me say this to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.964" offset="735274">I had submitted an instruction to the judge in the second trial that the jury should be charged if they could give Mr. Chaffin no more than 15 years what he got in the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.095" offset="775711">The judge refused the instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.349" offset="784802">After the jury returned a sentence of life, I thereafter objected strenuously under Pearce versus North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.939" offset="811133">The judge refused and let the life sentence stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.569" offset="825657">I might add that when the jury sets the sentence in Georgia, the judge does actually sign the sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="196.168" offset="888038">It might have later become a subject of a charge that this was a suggestion on a part of the judge that he was guilty?</text>

            <label>Mr. Glenn Zell</label>
            <text syncTime="210.541" offset="945507">Let me clear that a little bit, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.190" offset="952090">At the time of the second trial -- we now have a bifurcated trial in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.322" offset="972675">We have guilt and innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.869" offset="978840">Now, we have a sentencing or punishment to phase if he’s found guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.333" offset="992737">At the time of Mr. Chaffin’s both trials, there was none of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.605" offset="1005798">They tried guilt and innocence and punishment at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.666" offset="1021994">So the judge charged the jury on guilt and innocence, and also charged the jury on sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.807" offset="1042578">All in the same same set of instructions, you see.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.592" offset="1053759">So, in charge in a jury prior to the instructions, I said, Your Honor, if the jury does find him guilty would you include in your charge they can give no more than 15 years what he got in the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.332" offset="1092733">Judge refused the instruction.</text>

            <label>Mr. Glenn Zell</label>
            <text syncTime="260.692" offset="1146128">In fact, he charged death.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.223" offset="1152293">I’ll cover that, the jury was out about two hours in the death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.452" offset="1165145">They came back filing for life.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.736" offset="1174340">Now at this point, of course, we are familiar with Stroud versus U. S. which this court in 1919, “The Birdman of Alcatraz”, I think he was known as, received a life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.279" offset="1212479">He appealed it, reversed it and on this retrial, he got death and this Court affirmed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.050" offset="1235571">Now of course, Furman versus Georgia come out, again my state, and this -- that they may or may not still be enforced, I don’t know.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="291.539" offset="1269530">Well, didn’t the Greene case intervened and solved that problem?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="glenn_zell" startTime="296.010" stopTime="429.545">
            <label>Mr. Glenn Zell</label>
            <text syncTime="296.010" offset="1287398">Well, there’s been the Greene case, but that deals with now -- with conviction with the crime itself, we're talking about punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.981" offset="1319267">Greene dealt with first degree and second arson.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.452" offset="1333164">The Georgia case, I think it was Price versus Georgia dealt with the man slaughter murder verdicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.393" offset="1348942">You remember that?</text>
            <text syncTime="312.200" offset="1352182">Where he was found guilty of murder, you reversed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.190" offset="1360123">You found him guilty of man slaughter, Georgia tried to try him again for murder, you said they can't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.864" offset="1374856">He was acquitted of murder, manslaughter was most he could get on second retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.735" offset="1390320">We’re talking here about punishment, not about crime which clearly there is a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.844" offset="1410800">Now, Mr. Justice White, Justice Harlan, Mr. Justice Marshall, Mr. Justice Douglas say that double jeopardy applies to punishment as well as the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.783" offset="1446536">I’ve taken this attack as well and accepted it naturally.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.113" offset="1459806">I also argued due process and equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.222" offset="1472240">I thereafter, after the conviction of life, I went to the Georgia Supreme Court and they affirmed it, again, citing a previous Georgia case.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.547" offset="1509543">I then went to the Federal District Court in the second go around and Judge Sydney Smith affirmed it, denied the writ and then I went to the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.970" offset="1539218">Fifth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.248" offset="1544338">I lost in four courts and I am now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.189" offset="1560116">I didn’t get a a dissent yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.533" offset="1573491">I’d like to then get into the constitutional questions involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.647" offset="1590000">Very surely of course, it’s the right of appeal obviously.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.896" offset="1606928">If a man gets a sentence, if he gets a high sentence, of course, he has less to loose.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.400" offset="1628975">He will appeal if he gets a life sentence certainly or certainly a death sentence, but if a man gets one or two years, now for example rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.909" offset="1658964">In Georgia it's anywhere from one year to 20 years life or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.489" offset="1673279">If a man gets one or two years on a rape charge or a robbery charge which is anywhere from one to 20 years life or death or burglary which is one to 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.262" offset="1704417">Forgery is one to 10, theft or taking is one to 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.378" offset="1716851">So meaning, if it’s a low end of sentence, one or two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.376" offset="1728867">There’s this threat by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.735" offset="1734301">It’s implied for it obviously, that if you appeal on a retrial, we’ll go for the maximum sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.607" offset="1761782">This is a built-in threat, it’s not an expressed threat, it’s an implied threat, not to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.665" offset="1782053">Now, I think in any system of justice, we should encourage a man to exercise his rights, whether it'd be for jury trial or for an appeal and we should encourage --</text>

            <text syncTime="1556.274" offset="6328508">I think the question we have here is a very narrow one, relative to the Pearce due process question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.225" offset="6364244">I believe this Court has held in Stroud, the Pearce, and the Colten cases that nether double jeopardy or equal protection impose an absolute bar to a higher sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.928" offset="6403114">So I think, we are limited in this case to the narrow question of whether or not a jury can impose a harsher sentence on retrial and the authority involved here is the Pearce case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.066" offset="6463613">And as the Fifth Circuit read the case and as I read the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.865" offset="6478869">And hopefully as the Court wrote the case that was based on the due process argument or requirement that a prisoner should be free from apprehension that should he appeal he might receive a higher sentence solely because he appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.504" offset="6541354">The judge is saying, you appealed my ruling, my sentence, well, I’m going to show you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2027.708" offset="8214235">The fact is that if he appeals, he has a four possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.201" offset="8232208">He can come out less, he can come out and be turned loose the second time not guilty, he can come out with less time the second time around, he can come out with the same amount or he can get more but the first two possibilities, that is that he will be found not guilty or he will get less times seem to be the more reasonable predictions of what will happen because the second time around, the prosecution, I can tell you has a hard time getting the witness as the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.018" offset="8339414">And the second time, it’s even harder to round up the witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="2086.667" offset="8450069">They all want to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.550" offset="8457592">It seems to me that a majority of them want to appeal anyway, no matter what their sentence is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.978" offset="8487267">Now, Mr. Zell in his brief in his argument, it seems to say that we are limited at first sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2162.736" offset="8754343">That was his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.479" offset="8761240">The second time around and now of course the state's case was the same, we had the same victim, same outcry of witnesses and things of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.015" offset="8799483">But the defendant, the second time around said, he didn’t present his alibi witness, he just said, I was in Warm Springs and I didn’t do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.176" offset="8836054">Then, he also presented a psychiatrist and a psychologist who said that he did know there’s between right and wrong under the M'Naghten Rule and he wasn’t guilty for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.990" offset="8879313">On rebuttal, the prosecutor put up a doctor who examined the defendant within four to five hours prior to the commission of this crime and said he was perfectly fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.280" offset="8916511">The defense psychiatrist and psychologist didn’t examine him until nine months after the commission of the crime before the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.192" offset="8952142">So, it would seem to a reasonable person sitting on jury, a doctor who examined the man within hours of the commission of the crime, would seem to have more credibility than a doctor who had examined him some nine months later.</text>

            <text syncTime="2259.347" offset="9140746">And for some reason, he then proceeded to strike her in the head, knock her down, take a t-shirt and choke her.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.094" offset="9175751">Next thing she remembers is waking up in the woods in Clayton County some distance away where she had been brutally beaten.</text>

            <text syncTime="2422.792" offset="9794539">It would -- that certainly would not be admissible in Georgia, to say what his prior sentence was and they just wouldn't know that unless it was highly publicized crime or something then they might know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.599" offset="9837798">In a situation where they would know in a highly publicized crime or if it should come out in the trial then the Pearce rule to show vindictiveness could be applied to the jury, but in the general run of the mill cases where the jury does the sentencing the Pearce vindictiveness rule does just not apply as far as we are concerned and that is what the Fifth Circuit has held also.</text>

            <text syncTime="2467.139" offset="9971963">Let me just say this up on my defense is a fairly pitch quite a bit from doctors and so the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.991" offset="10003310">They would have just had seen him and just said that he appeared to be okay to me which you could think of Napoleon, and some of you might think you are okay just for a few minutes but anyway, the evidence was the same as to the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.722" offset="10046255">You say that’s the important thing we are concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.146" offset="10059943">This Court has never commented or discussed Stroud problem, life to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.296" offset="10076557">It seems to stay away from that and that's what I am asking this Court to do is overturn the doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.626" offset="10093902">And the -- what I am saying is I am agreeing with Justice Douglas and I believe Justice Marshall in their concurring in Pearce case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.785" offset="10126503">The balancing, the sentence upward or downward on a retrial, you should favor the defendant on balance to give him the unfettered right of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.461" offset="10169240">That’s basically the primary base of my argument is justice Douglas as concurring in Pearce.</text>

            <text syncTime="2550.019" offset="10303404">But the only charge against him was the robbery case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.848" offset="10314794">He actually robbed her car that’s this case was about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.832" offset="10326706">After not already took her car and that what’s the charge is stealing or robbing her car by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.951" offset="10359202">But I want to stress this Stroud doctrine that is still alive and that’s what I want to see overturned from life to death that is still with this Court it has never been overturned.</text>
