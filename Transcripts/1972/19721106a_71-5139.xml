            <label>Mr. Jonathan Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="29.846" offset="222751">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.235" offset="236335">This case is here on certiorari to a decision of the South Carolina Supreme Court affirming petitioner’s conviction and sentenced to one-and-a-half years of hard labor for the possession of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.904" offset="294954">The certiorari grant was limited to the issue of whether a black criminal defendant is constitutionally entitled to any opportunity to examine prospective jurors on voir dire with respect to whether they are prejudice against him because of his race or because of certain pretrial publicity in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.548" offset="389517">Thus, this case raises for the first time in this Court as a question of the right of a criminal defendant to examine and to challenge for cause a jurors who are called to decide his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.851" offset="466735">We think that that right is a part of the constitutional right to a jury trial and that in this case it was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.471" offset="505292">The petitioner is a black civil rights worker who has been active in the County of Florence in South Carolina as a representative of SCLC, as well as at the time a member of the Bi-Racial Commission of the City of Florence.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.338" offset="572688">He was indicted on June 1, 1970 for the crime of possession of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.176" offset="608110">His defense in the case into trial of the case at which he testified was that the charge against him was a result of complicity by the local police authorities to frame him because of his civil rights activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.792" offset="674565">Over his objection, the trial was commenced on the day after indictment that is on June 2nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.261" offset="708420">Although petitioner, his counsel sought to make motions for a change of venue and for a continuance on the basis of pretrial publicity and possible prejudice on the part of the prospective jurors, he was unable to do so in sworn affidavits as required under South Carolina Law and rather was forced to make the request orally to the court which overruled both motions summarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.919" offset="827016">He made similarly an oral motion to quash the trial venire on the grounds that blacks had been systematically excluded and after a hearing on the June 2nd, the Court denied that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.558" offset="893576">On the next day, prior to the selection of the jury, a petitioner requested the trial judge to voir dire the prospective jurors with respect to several matters relating to whether they were prejudiced against him because he was black and because of certain pretrial publicity in extrajudicial statements in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.505" offset="997439">Specifically, he requested that each prospective juror be asked whether he or she was prejudiced against Negroes, whether the fact that the defendant was black would affect his or her ability to render an impartial judgment and verdict in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.911" offset="1074970">Whether the fact that the petitioner was bearded would make any difference in the way they decided the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.561" offset="1105586">In addition, he specifically requested that the trial judge asked the jurors about certain publicity which he claimed had poisoned the minds of -- or possibly poisoned the minds of persons in that county with respect to persons charged with the crime which the petitioner was charged with, and also with respect to whether any of them had heard a television program several days before the trial at which the State’s chief prosecution witness had appeared and had talked extensively in connection with drug crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.311" offset="1272665">The trial judge refused to ask any of the proposed questions on the grounds that they were irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.940" offset="1307146">Instead, he posed three questions to the perspective jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.250" offset="1340374">He asked them whether any of them had formed or expressed an opinion as to guilt or innocence of the petitioner whether any of them was sensible of any bias or prejudice for or against him and whether each of them could give the State and the defendant a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.206" offset="1428146">The entire examination of the prospective jurors in this case took a total of 12 pages of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.398" offset="1464926">It was hurried, formalistic and routine.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.486" offset="1481331">Each juror as he was called and sworn was put, the exact same question by the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.378" offset="1512887">Each juror with two exceptions answered the questions, the first two question no and the third question yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.348" offset="1548727">No further examination was gone into in any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.136" offset="1567953">The only two exceptions was one juror who answered the first two questions no, but in response to the third question said that she was rather not cert.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.108" offset="1619780">One juror said that she had a formed or expressed in opinion as to guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.783" offset="1646529">But beyond that, no jurors in anything more than no, no, yes to the entire board to your proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="561.571" offset="2349641">And the South Carolina Supreme Court has interpreted that statute to be satisfied when questions, general questions has a nature put to the jurors by the trial judge are asked.</text>

            <text syncTime="604.523" offset="2521422">The refusal of the trial judge to voir dire the jurors with respect to the issues posed was raised on appeal on the South Carolina Supreme Court which affirmed the conviction holding that it was within the discretion of the trial judge to refuse the questions and that there was no abuse of that discretion shown in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="653.371" offset="2716818">That’s correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.315" offset="2736671">We don’t understand the State in this case to question the general proposition that a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to challenge for cause, jurors who are prejudice against him because of race or because of pretrial publicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.134" offset="2811904">The right of challenge is a right which we think is a necessary component of two independent constitutional rights, the right to a jury trial and the right to a trial before an impartial tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.067" offset="2879613">The right to a jury trial has included the right challenge as long as there have been jury trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.767" offset="2918484">It’s a right which developed at the time the right to a jury trial developed in the first instance and has never been deviated from the either before or after the adoption of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.628" offset="2981909">What Mr. Justice Powell said with respect to unanimity requirement in the Apodaca case, we think is equally if not more true about the right of challenge and that is that, although the history of the Sixth Amendment is ambiguous in the sense that we don’t have the record of the framers, the history of the right of challenge at common law has been unambiguous and we think that it has been related to the right to jury trial for a time in more.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.925" offset="3127045">We think also that the right of challenge is essential to the very function which the jury is intended to serve and that is to provide an impartial barrier between the State and the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.769" offset="3198412">If there’s any one element of the right to jury trial which is essential, we think it’s the impartiality of that body and we think that the right of challenge is the only means of successfully guarantying that impartiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.199" offset="3260165">We think also that the right of challenge is implicit in the right to jury trial in this Court’s decision in Apodaca where the rationale for eliminating the unanimity requirement is premised on the defendant’s ability to secure an impartial, responsible panel of jurors who will decide his case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1111.034" offset="4547480">There was a voir dire examination in the Aldridge case which is set out at 283 U.S. 309 and that examination did relate to the facts of that particular case bias or prejudice of the juries with respect to certain kind of evidence and certainly even that examination was a lot more extensive than the examination in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.619" offset="4689899">The judge in that case did refuse a specific question with regard to racial prejudice and this Court held that that refusal violated the essential demands of fairness under the circumstances of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.749" offset="4758340">In addition to the right of challenge resting on the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial as applied for the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.458" offset="4789164">We think it also is directly related to the right to a trial before an impartial body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.493" offset="4817377">We think that the right of challenge is crucial to selecting jurors who will not be influence by passion or prejudice or extrajudicial matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.554" offset="4861576">We think it’s more essential even than the right which this Court recognize in Groppi versus Wisconsin to obtain of change of venue in certain cases and indeed is more basic to than the right to a cross-section of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.259" offset="4932420">Because this right is one which can only be satisfied, the right to an impartial jury, one can only determine the partiality of jurors by questioning them specifically and exercising the right of challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.525" offset="5021445">The only position the State takes basically in this case is that the general questions that the judge did put to the jury and satisfied whatever constitutional requirements there are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.167" offset="5080064">However, to conclude that we think would make the constitutional requirement hollow indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.593" offset="5109739">Because the questions which were asked did not relate in any way and did not direct the juries attention in any way to the crucial questions which counsel sought to put to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.749" offset="5166373">There was no question at all which can even be construed as asking the jurors whether they had heard or had been prejudice by any of the extrajudicial statements or the pretrial publicity which had related to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.552" offset="5221543">The only question which came -- comes near that is the question as to whether they had formed or expressed any opinion with respect to the case but it must be recognized that at that time when that question was asked, the jurors knew nothing whatsoever about the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.639" offset="5289880">All they knew was that the defendant’s name was Gene Ham.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.448" offset="5305135">They didn’t know what the nature of the case was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.059" offset="5315584">They didn’t know what the crime he was charged with was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.065" offset="5327600">And they had no idea of who was going to testify in the case and as I pointed out before, the chief prosecution witness was the person who had appeared on local television several days before discussing drug crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.624" offset="5397817">In that sense, the case is very close to Turner versus Louisiana where this Court held that the contact between the jurors and prosecution witnesses even without a showing of actual bias or prejudice was enough to deny the defendant a right to an impartial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.570" offset="5477648">The other questions with respect to general bias or prejudice for or against, we don’t think can satisfy the requirements of probing racial prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.638" offset="5533968">But we think that this Court’s decision in Aldridge, in Dennis, in Morford indicate the specific inquiries are indeed essential to securing an impartial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.496" offset="5585377">We think it’s clear that when jurors are put formal hurried questions in open court where an immediate response is expected, they won’t volunteer thing such as whether or not they are prejudice because of race.</text>

            <text syncTime="1406.212" offset="5728214">So that we think that the general question as put would reduce the right of challenge and the right of examination to a hollow guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.148" offset="5784012">This Court has recognized that the jury is fundamental to American scheme of justice but the jury will only be able to serve its high function if the procedures are designed to ensure impartialities to the greatest extent of passing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.811" offset="5854647">Because petitioner was deprived of the opportunity to secure the impartiality in this case, we think his right to an impartial jury was denied and that is conviction should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1470.701" offset="5986200">It basically appeared to be two issues involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.358" offset="5996753">First, did the trial judges refusal a prejudicial pretrial publicity or questioning as to prejudicial pretrial publicity on the examination of the jurors through the voir dire, violate their ability to render a fair verdict?</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.705" offset="6054222">There’s no question to that pretrial publicity is a proper subject for questioning on voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.243" offset="6080345">If there is a showing that pretrial publicity did exist that the pretrial publicity did refer to the petitioner that the pretrial publicity was prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.281" offset="6120469">In this case, there was no such showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.081" offset="6131649">There was no pretrial publicity which referred directly to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.081" offset="6147741">There was no pretrial publicity which is prejudicial nor was any pretrial publicity other than general publicity regarding the drug problem in the State of South Carolina, County of Florence which we contend there is no -- I mean in newspaper in the state today that you cannot pick up with that finding, some allegations as to drug use or drug abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.701" offset="6238124">The facts in this case reveal that the pretrial publicity alleged to be prejudicial consisted of three articles in the same newspaper published on the same date.</text>

            <text syncTime="1606.995" offset="6531323">With no showing of pretrial publicity, that was prejudicial, the chief question of this appeal becomes whether the refusal of the trial judge to ask the specific questions sought on voir dire pertaining to the defendant’s race and the fact that he wears a beard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.211" offset="6592240">The trial judge ruled that this proffered questions were irrelevant and he asked general questions instead and the general questions being have he formed or expressed any opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant, Gene Ham?</text>

            <text syncTime="1652.221" offset="6712299">Is it necessary that the trial judge asks, are you aware of any bias or prejudice for or against this defendant who is a Negro, black and wears a beard when these facts are so obvious?</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.656" offset="6750020">The State contends, not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.397" offset="6756916">Did not, the general questioning presented encompasses specific inquiries sought by the petitioner, we think that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.787" offset="6786487">And we think the effectiveness of this general questioning was proved by the facts when two jurors stated in response to the general questions that they could not fairly serve and they were excused by the trial court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2262.727" offset="9154330">That’s correct Your Honor, I think that the general questions asked did encompass specific question sought absent some showing that the specific questions might elicit some bias or prejudice and the suspicion that somebody’s prejudice must have some grounds for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.693" offset="9246177">I submit that the Sixth Amendment requires not that the juror be free of all partiality but such a perfect jury does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.711" offset="9274180">A voir dire examination designed to uncover all existing biases of prejudice or partiality could lead to the circumstances recognized by one of our State Supreme Court and I state in their opinion that I quote “The records of the cases appeal to this Court in which rulings made while impaneling a jury have been involved, indicate that there is an increasing tendency to prolong the proceedings inordinately by allowing counsel on either side to indulge of tedious examination of jurors apparently with no definite purpose or object in view but with a hope of eliciting something indicating the advisability of rendering, a preempt for a challenge and that is supposed privilege of doing so has been greatly abused.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.580" offset="9453693">This opinion was rendered in 1912 and I think this is even more appropriate today, the congested court docket, and the congested system of judicial administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.878" offset="9498833">These go into the conclusion that an unlimited voir dire examination cannot coexist with efficient administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.363" offset="9532792">It must be some compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.191" offset="9540106">We contend that this compromise is a laying of the groundwork for the admission of the particular question sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.863" offset="9566856">Absent of this ground, we think that there is no basis for these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.428" offset="9589112">We contended there was no abuse of discretion in the instant case particularly when the judges -- trial judges voir dire examination encompass the specific inquiry sought and was effective to produce a jury which could render a fair and impartial trial that verdict be based upon the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.220" offset="9656299">Rather, we state that is more effective if the question -- this general question is proved to supply this necessary jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.186" offset="9700080">For these reasons, we respectively -- respectfully submit in conclusion that decision in South Carolina State Supreme Court be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2415.335" offset="9764760">I would like to first address myself to the point derived by Mr. Justice Stewart with respect to whether the issue was properly presented below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.886" offset="9794957">In the briefs in the South Carolina Supreme Court, the petitioner made the following statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.313" offset="9820662">“The question is a Constitutional one of due process of law as for whether a jury is prejudice or partial in the sense of one of the parties has denied a fair and impartial trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.603" offset="9857755">It is not a procedural one to determine by statutory construction but one of vital substance of law under the Constitution.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.719" offset="9886281">That petitioner was referring to United States Constitution is made clear in the following paragraphs where he continues and quotes Irvin versus Dowd, Sheppard versus Maxwell and Irideau versus Louisiana for the proposition that the refusal to ask the question designed to insure the right to an impartial trial is included in this Court so pronouncement in those cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2480.355" offset="10024835">What I gather Mr. Shapiro, in the Supreme Court of South Carolina that you first -- that constitutional question was first raised, is it?</text>

            <text syncTime="2491.448" offset="10069138">We think however under South Carolina practice that it was appropriate with the race in the way it was and the assignments in there and in the South Carolina Supreme Court, and that the fact that the South Carolina Supreme Court didn’t explicitly refer to the Constitution in its opinion does not indicate that it wasn’t presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.779" offset="10158477">In fact, there were a several constitutional issues that were presented as clearly as this one which the South Carolina Supreme Court equally neglected to, refer to in its opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2529.712" offset="10222216">As Justice Rehnquist implicitly pointed out in dealing with the motion for a continuance, the South Carolina Supreme Court explicitly did deal with it as a constitutional question citing Powell against Alabama and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.279" offset="10284492">But with this issue, the only issue now before us, one could never know from reading the opinion of the South Carolina Supreme Court that that court understood that it was faced with the federal constitutional issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2555.806" offset="10326601">Frankly, I think it’s without rhyme and reason, the issues which the South Carolina Supreme Court shows to refer to in federal constitutional term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.653" offset="10365994">Petitioner also argued that denial of his right to a change of venue expressed, he violated his right to a fair impartial trial under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment yet the South Carolina Supreme Court makes no reference at all to the federal constitution in disposing of that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.520" offset="10441435">So we think that that cannot be taken to mean that they didn’t consider.</text>

            <text syncTime="3161.259" offset="12748361">Of courts, the judge refused to ask the question without any determination as to whether in fact there had been such a television program or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.510" offset="12785455">And we think that the way you -- in case comes up it’s implicit that he assumed that there was a program and in fact he said that the question was irrelevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3213.062" offset="12955669">Counsel had no opportunity to prepare a form of motion to collect the newspaper clippings to make a full presentation as to the extent of possible publicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.160" offset="12996002">He was forced to go to trial over his objection on the very next day after the indictment was returned and we think especially in light of that unseemly haste that it was more than necessary to have the jurors examine with respect to the issues he raised.</text>
