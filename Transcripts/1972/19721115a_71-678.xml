            <text syncTime="61.840" offset="350751">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.459" offset="361200">This case on certiorari to Sixth Circuit calls upon this court to resolve any records out of the conflict between the Third Circuit in an opinion of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.996" offset="403310">The issue presented is whether the Federal courts have maritime jurisdiction over airplane crashes in navigable waters where the tortuous conduct is alleged to have occurred on land.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.401" offset="452942">The facts in this case are under perjury undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.576" offset="469661">The petitioners are the owner and operator of a corporate twin-engine jet aircraft, known as the Falcon.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.151" offset="499963">They and their aircraft prepared to takeoff from Burke Lakefront Airport at Cleveland, Ohio on July of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.020" offset="531414">Burke Lakefront is owned and operated by the respondent city of Cleveland, Ohio and is built on a fill and the navigable waters of Lake Erie.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.665" offset="570075">On the day in question, the aircraft was piloted by two pilots and had a crew of one stewardess and was prepared to takeoff to pick up passengers in Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.538" offset="621484">There is some question in the record as to the clearance given to the pilots before takeoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.768" offset="650428">It our position that the questions of tributary negligence not being before this Court, those matters are irrelevant, however they have been raised in the respondent's briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.458" offset="689194">In any event there is no question about the fact that the pilots did see -- could not see the other end of the runway before takeoff, could not see that the last third of the runway was covered by a flock of seagulls and did receive a clearance for takeoff from the air traffic controllers in the tower, from respondent Dicken who is employed by the United States government.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.627" offset="777906">The aircraft took off.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.193" offset="788146">Shortly after liftoff, the pilots noticed for the first time the sea of seagulls.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.355" offset="808835">As the plane approached the seagulls, the flock rose, the aircraft struck many of the birds, 314 of the seagulls were found on the runway alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.164" offset="851989">Thereafter, birds were ingested into the engines of the Jet, the engines flamed out and the pilot prepared for a ditching.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.486" offset="885321">He raised the landing gear and prepared for a crash landing.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.396" offset="904965">On the way down, the aircraft landing gear did strike the top of a pickup truck parked near the airport perimeter fence and broke the barbwire of the perimeter fence.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.985" offset="955329">And there is an appendix of photographs to this case which shows the damage done to the vehicle and the fence, birds on the runway for the whatever use it maybe to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.377" offset="996916">In any event the aircraft continued in flight and impacted in the navigable waters of Lake Erie.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.120" offset="1023875">When airborne again, it impacted a second time where it sank in what has been undisputed navigable waters, something in depth of an excess of 45 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.650" offset="1065984">There is also a photograph, I believe it's photograph three showing an X out in the lake when the aircraft submerged the pilots and stewardess miraculously were not injured or killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.341" offset="1116766">They exited from the aircraft and a small craft picked them up.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.901" offset="1134947">The coastguard came, there was an effort made to put a line around the aircraft and pull it towards shore and the place where they succeeded in dragging it is the second X on the photograph.</text>

            <label>Mr. Phillip D. Bostwick</label>
            <text syncTime="281.048" offset="1227525">The crew were deadheading if the Court pleased to pick up some revenue paying passengers at another airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.410" offset="1260962">It had been positioned at Burke Lakefront airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.840" offset="1278725">The aircraft was salvaged after remaining submerged in the lake for two days.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.784" offset="1314461">Skin divers were used, a contract barge was used and the aircraft was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.216" offset="1332224">It was dropped back into the lake during raising and additional damage was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.016" offset="1347480">In any event when it had been retrieved from the lake, after over two days, the extensive water soaking to the expensive avionics navigation and equipment and instruments, and to the interior of the aircraft, the impact damage which had been done to the fuselage of the aircraft by the two impacts at the lake caused the aircraft to be a total loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.883" offset="1438908">And there is no dispute in this case of two facts; one that the aircraft did crash in navigable waters of Lake Erie and two that as a result of that crash in the lake the aircraft was totally destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.652" offset="1497945">Two actions were brought by the petitioners in the federal court in Cleveland.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.775" offset="1514454">One against United States under the Tort Claims Act, alleging negligence of the air traffic controllers in clearing the aircraft to takeoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.885" offset="1546951">Because diversity was not existent between the petitioners a Columbus, Ohio Corporation and the City of Cleveland, the owner and the operators of the airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.452" offset="1593135">A second action was filed at Federal Court against the City of Cleveland and a respondent Dicken, also a resident of Ohio, alleging Admiralty and Maritime Jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.651" offset="1641932">The complaints are virtually identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.119" offset="1651858">A motion to consolidate for discovery and all purposes including trial was made by the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.708" offset="1678190">City of Cleveland moved nearly three years ago to dismiss the second action on the ground of no subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.017" offset="1715388">The District Court after six months decided that there was no subject matter jurisdiction for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.555" offset="1741615">One, the locality of the tort was over land. District Court relied on a Sixth Circuit case entitled Wiper against Great Lakes Engineering Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.128" offset="1783933">As an alternative holding, the District Court found that there was no maritime nexus between the wrongs alleged in the complaint and any maritime commerce navigation or service relying on the Sixth Circuit case of Chapman against Grosse Pointe Farms.</text>

            <text syncTime="448.910" offset="1898977">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.463" offset="1909217">The court below in this case with one judge dissenting, affirmed that the holding of the District Court insofar as the court had ruled that the locality of the tort was over land.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.809" offset="1950595">However, in so doing, it did not follow its own cases, but said this case was controlled by three cases from this Court decided in 1928 and 1935, Minnie against Port Huron, Smith &amp; Son against Taylor and the Admiral Peoples.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.183" offset="2024155">The court below said that it was not necessary to reach the question of maritime nexus having found that the locality of the tort was on land.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.436" offset="2061145">It’s our position -- our argument is twofold and it is that there is an irreconcilable conflict between the opinion of the court below on the question of the locality of the tort for this case and the Third Circuit's ruling in Weinstein and we urge that this Court resolve that conflict by adopting Weinstein rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.368" offset="2144841">We also urge that as to the question of maritime nexus, this Court follow the course that it took in 1914 in Atlantic Transport against Imbrovek and find that if anything more than the locality of the tort is required, that the relationship between this tort and maritime affairs was quite sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.218" offset="2220283">Now turning first with regard to the locality of the tort, the Sixth Circuit in this case, are relying upon the three cases that I just mentioned, found that the rule was as to the situs of the tort, that the situs of the tort is where the negligence becomes operative or effective on the party not where the damages or the major portions of them are sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.249" offset="2312338">Under this legal rule, the court found that the negligence became operative when the birds first went through the engine and caused a loss of power to the air craft and that occurred over the runway.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.949" offset="2359150">Therefore, the locality of the tort in this case, the court found, was on land.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.364" offset="2384854">In so doing, the Sixth Circuit said that this ruling did not conflict with the Third Circuit’s decision in 1963 in Weinstein against Eastern Airlines, found at 316 F.2d.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.264" offset="2432397">We respectfully submit that that portion of the court’s opinion is unsupportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.941" offset="2455176">The facts of the Weinstein case, one of the 150 cases to reach the Federal courts, arising out of the Boston Harbor tragedy in the early 1960s, are virtually identical to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.475" offset="2501256">In the Boston Harbor tragedy the facts which were reported In Wrap against Eastern Airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.515" offset="2521422">An Eastern Airline’s Electra took off from Logan Airport and six-tenths of a mile from the takeoff into the runway it ran into a flight of starlings.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.853" offset="2554755">The birds were ingested into the engines, which were jet engines driving propellers.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.511" offset="2573458">50 to 100 dead birds were found on the end of the runway.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.439" offset="2585161">The birds caused an immediate loss of power and the aircraft crashed thereafter in the navigable waters of Boston Harbor, 47 seconds after liftoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.823" offset="2622673">The libellants brought libels in Admiralty and the respondents claimed that there was no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.994" offset="2671365">The District Judge, Judge Van Dusen found that the stuff of admiralty concerned vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.864" offset="2694875">But in the absence of any legislation, like Congress concerning aircraft crashes in navigable territorial waters that the admiralty did not have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.487" offset="2733328">On appeal to the Third Circuit, the Third Circuit reversed that narrow view.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.316" offset="2752658">In an opinion written in 1963 by Chief Judge Biggs which has been cited and quoted for nearly a decade thereafter, the Third Circuit held that admiralty, that concepts of admiralty tort jurisdiction could not and should not remain static and unchanging.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.011" offset="2819427">In a review of the law the court noted that the first aircraft crash cases arose out of The Death of a High Seas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.907" offset="2850983">That the same arguments had been made to with that the Act did not apply to aircraft crashes.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.157" offset="2880031">That view had been rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.454" offset="2889226">Now in this first case of crash in the territorial navigable waters, Chief Judge Biggs found that the applicable precedent from this Court was the Plymouth and that the historic view of this Court, indeed as expressed again by this Court, last Term, in Victory Carriers against Law was that the locality of the tort determined whether or not it was of a maritime nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.031" offset="2983476">In determining where a tort occurs, Chief Judge Biggs looked at that at the Plymouth a case from this Court which held that a tort occurs where the damages are completed or substantial amount of the damages are completed and the Plymouth held that the maritime jurisdiction depends upon the locality where the injuries or the substantial portion of them take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.076" offset="3087653">Having concluded that the Plymouth was the applicable authority, the Third Circuit found that even though the alleged negligence in the Boston Harbor tragedy was alleged maintenance on land and ineffective design of the aircraft that the “disastrous effects” of that tortuous conduct had occurred on navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.810" offset="3170617">That is to say, the crash itself, the damage to the aircraft, the injuries and the deaths of the passengers therein had occurred on navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.080" offset="3203741">It, therefore, found in a case virtually identical to this on this factual situation that the tort occurred in navigable waters and therefore it was a maritime tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.397" offset="3244910">It was argued to the Third Circuit that a maritime nexus was also required in addition to locality and that no nexus should be found in that case in which an aircraft which was headed from Boston to Philadelphia virtually all over land had crashed fortuitously in waters of Boston Harbor.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.764" offset="3318471">That view is reject by the Third Circuit on the reasoning that there is an analogy between aircraft which goes down in navigable waters and ships would sink in navigable waters and they found that there is a connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.902" offset="3382941">There is a similarity and that to dangers to person’s property are the same when an aircraft crashes in navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.983" offset="3419303">Therefore, they assumed for purposes of argument that if there was such a locality plus requirement, that it was present in that case, and therefore, they held that there was maritime jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.669" offset="3486072">Certiorari was denied by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.924" offset="3499029">That case has been followed and cited in nearly a decade since it was passed on.</text>

            <text syncTime="853.783" offset="3518464">That means that if you fly from New York or Washington to Miami or Palm Beach, Florida, and for varying times you are under, admiralty maritime jurisdiction or under conventional common law jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="881.254" offset="3628387">We believe that the jurisdictional point arises, if there is a crash on that flight and there was some discussion in the early days of aviation concerning whether the airspace above the entire earth as well as the sea was subject to the maritime jurisdiction, but as a matter of fact the Federal Aviation Act is based upon the commerce clause and the regulations which affect aircraft passing over states and over water and land is based upon that clause, but where there is a crash on that flight, whether it is beyond one marine league from the shore, whether it is 2400 yards off the the Florida Coast as was the case in Kelly, or whether it is next to the Miami airport to the closest navigable water on takeoff or landing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1547.845" offset="6294758">No sir, I wish to reserve few moments in rebuttal, but in answer to your question Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the aircraft which fly over navigable waters as distinguished from automobiles, do have a maritime plus in that the majority of the passengers which used to travel by boat, now travel by air and there is a need, there is a vast number of aviation accidents, because of the number of airports built on and around navigable waters and the number of accidents which occur in and around the landing patterns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.667" offset="6470092">There is a large number of aircraft crashes in navigable waters, in territorial navigable waters and we believe that they present a problem which has been solved by the lower courts under Weinstein and that rule is the proper one which should be continued and ratified by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1678.407" offset="6816998">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.771" offset="6838418">I think that this is the first time that I have ever been a proctor in admiralty to which I was admitted some years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.521" offset="6885439">Let me start by restating the facts of the case which are illustrated by this chart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.942" offset="6939146">Here is in the brief for the City of Cleveland and is plaintiffs exhibit 4 in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.727" offset="6974255">North is to the right which is perhaps a little misleading, but if I took the chart to side and the lettering is hard to read, the plane started here at the runway at the gate, came to the end of the sixth left runway and started down the runway to the north-east.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.825" offset="7106644">At this place, where it says ‘Rotate Area’, that is airplane language for takeoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.704" offset="7134229">What you do is rotate the nose of the plane and the takeoff was between 2,800 and 3,000 feet down the runway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.762" offset="7178428">The bird area was between 3,600 feet and 6,200 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.967" offset="7203192">But before the plane had left the end of the runway, the Control Tower had said, “Caution, birds on end of runway,” and that appears on page 14 of the record and then had added, “It looks like there are a million of them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.785" offset="7290546">Now, the plane started down, nevertheless, and took off at 2,800 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.426" offset="7321057">When it took off the bird flushed into the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.199" offset="7336208">The plane hit the birds in this area over land, as Mr. Bostwick has said, 314 dead birds were found on the runway on land and the engines of the plane were filled with ingested birds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.380" offset="7412903">The plane immediately lost power, the pilot endeavored to take what steps he could to get out of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.983" offset="7451355">He hit the perimeter fence of the airport here and a truck which was parked at the end of the airport and this statement on the exhibit E. McA is Mr. McAvoy's initial which he put on the exhibit to indicate that is the point where the truck was hit, all of this of this of course is on land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.256" offset="7548426">By this time, the plane is almost hopelessly disabled and it was a miracle that it finally came through and the three persons on board came out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.970" offset="7607254">These dotted lines are the course of the plane after hitting the truck, they too were put on the exhibit as the testimony of Mr. McAvoy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1893.587" offset="7677680">And the plane finally came to the rest -- to rest in the water here and this E. McA 9 is Mr. McAvoy's testimony that represents the place where it came to rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.528" offset="7733478">I may point out that this is the Cleveland breakwater here, all of this is inside the breakwater, that doesn't mean that it is not navigable water, but it is not the high sea on the lake, so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.446" offset="7801187">Now there is a reference in the briefs to the fact that the plane came to rest a fifth of a mile from the under the runway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.856" offset="7830758">That is literally true, this being the end the runaway and it's a fifth of a miles there, but it was only 30 or 40 feet from land to the North that the plane came to rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.551" offset="7893556">It's clear that the damage to the engines was done and completed before the plane hit the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.061" offset="7927620">It is also clear that there was substantial damage to the airframe from hitting the fence and the truck and the birds, before the plane hit the water.</text>

            <text syncTime="2151.801" offset="8710562">Mr. Crocker has generously given all of the time to me, but I am in a very real sense representing the City of Cleveland as well as the Airport Controller, and Mr. Crocker relies more heavily on this question of where was the tort than I do and I am sure that the Court will give careful consideration to his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.337" offset="8808678">This was the ground upon which the Six Circuit Court of Appeals decided the case and it relied primarily on three decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.886" offset="8846921">Now I know it is perfectly easy to go through this Court's admiralty cases over 100 years and find a case such as the one Mr. Bostwick referred to, the plaintiff, which rather refers to the consequences rather than to the point of impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.656" offset="8914004">The three cases which the Six Circuit relied on, Smith &amp; Son against Taylor, Minnie against Port Huron Terminal Company and finally The Admiral Peoples are all cases in which the Court made the decision between admiralty and non-admiralty turn on the point of injury in the sense of point of impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.719" offset="9030196">In Smith &amp; Son against Taylor a longshoreman was standing on a stage which rested on a port and projected a few feet over the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.317" offset="9076590">He was struck by a sling loaded with cargo which was being lowered over the side from the ship and not into the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.261" offset="9112430">And the Court held that was the – in -- the tort was on land and not in sea and that there could be no maritime recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.106" offset="9151822">The next case Minnie against Port Huron Terminal Company is almost exactly the converse and The Admiral Peoples is a gangplank case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.344" offset="9188707">There is slip and fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.495" offset="9197380">He slipped and fell on the gangplank and hit the port and that was held to be a ship injury, because the slip and fall was on the gangplank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.238" offset="9252342">Now the only case that really deals with this kind of accident is the Third Circuit's decision in Weinstein against Eastern Airlines and I would like to point out that though decision is certainly doctrinally inconsistent with the Six Circuit, there are no facts appeared in that case which are anything like the facts which have been shown here with respect to the injuries on and over land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.725" offset="9374281">For the Weinstein case arose on a motion to dismiss and the libel said that shortly after the aircraft had become airborne by reason of the negligence of the respondents and by virtue of their respective breach of warranties, said aircraft crashed into the navigable waters of Boston Harbor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.619" offset="9469889">And that is all the allegation there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.296" offset="9480547">There is no allegation there that anything happened on or above the land and the issue arose on the exceptions of the Eastern Airlines, the facts averred in the libel do not constitute a cause of action against Eastern Airlines Inc. within the admiralty jurisdiction of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.964" offset="9595277">I would like to devote the -- I think the factual situation is clear to the Court and the basis of the decision below appeared clearly in its opinion and we rely on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.227" offset="9652328">But I would like to devote the rest of my argument to the broader question, should admiralty law apply to an airplane crash of this sort?</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.203" offset="9692139">By that I am not weaving the place of the tort argument, I am seeking to present a broader ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.439" offset="9729128">The only reason that I can think of for bringing this within admiralty is a purely verbal one, namely that admiralty applies to the sea or in this country to in the navigable waters and this plane landed in the water ergo, admiralty jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.703" offset="9802167">But even on a verbal basis if we start by saying that admiralty relates to ships, then this case does not involve a ship and ergo, no admiralty jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.376" offset="9848874">Obviously, both of these approaches are essentially formal, I am not suggesting at all, of course, that admiralty must be confined to exactly what it covered in 1787 or 1789.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.306" offset="9908642">Obviously, the constitution should be construed so as to accommodate new developments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.973" offset="9935287">Admiralty took in steamships when they came and admiralty was rightly extended to the in the navigable waters of the United States which were something not paralleled in Britain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.397" offset="9988995">Similarly, the constitution gives Congress power with respect to an army and a navy and no one questions that, that applies also to an air force.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.367" offset="10036851">But it does not follow that admiralty should extend to every tort which occurs on water, if this tort did occur on water and specifically it does not follow that admiralty jurisdiction should be found to extend to airplane accidents of the sort involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.886" offset="10114905">There is no decision of this Court saying that any sort of airplane accident is within admiralty jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.243" offset="10152312">There are not even any decisions of this Court applying the Death on the High Seas Act to an Airplanes Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.479" offset="10185331">Thus this Court will not have to overrule any of its decisions or any make break in its established law if it comes to the conclusion that airplane accidents at least of the sort involved here do not come within admiralty jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.544" offset="10253563">The leading case to the contrary is the Weinstein case, a careful and thoughtful opinion by Judge Biggs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.853" offset="10294836">However, it’s perhaps worthy of note that Judge Van Dusen was the trial judge in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.391" offset="10324929">He decided to the contrary and Judge Van Dusen is now on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.247" offset="10356381">Indeed there was a certain amount of what layman at least might regard as lawyers playing games in the whole Eastern Airlines situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.760" offset="10402461">The crash occurred in Massachusetts, but that in that state has a narrow wrongful death statute with a limit on recovery fixed to $20,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.597" offset="10445720">So the suit was started in Pennsylvania where there is no such limitation and the Court of Appeals held there was admiralty jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.770" offset="10486471">After that though, counsel apparently gave further thought and feared that the court and admiralty might find that the Massachusetts statute was applicable because of the strength of these place of the tort decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.606" offset="10561808">And so suits were then brought on the law side of the Pennsylvania court based on diversity of citizenship which was easy to do, because you can appoint a nonresident administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.710" offset="10614262">And the suit was not based on the tort, but was based on breach of a contract of safe carriage as to which it was held at the Pennsylvania law applied and this is what was sustained by the Court of Appeals and they forwarded three decisions in Scott against the Eastern Airlines Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.217" offset="10704227">This Court denied certiorari in both of the Third Circuit cases, but that is as far as it has gone on this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.528" offset="10745501">Why should not admiralty law apply to all torts which occur or indeed come to rest on navigable water?</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.544" offset="10781550">One may as well ask the opposite question, why should admiralty law apply to all such torts when they have nothing to do with ships?</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.350" offset="10816763">There is a fundamental difference between ships and airplanes, apart from the fact that ships float on the sea and airplanes go through the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.900" offset="10855006">This is that ships always stay on the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.460" offset="10873187">Of course they can go aground, but the water puts them there and they can be put and dried up, but it's appropriately even held that since they float there that; that’s within admiralty jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.583" offset="10917700">The sea is the nourishing source for a ship, but an airplane is based on the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.695" offset="10946121">It flies equally well over land as oversea, whether it ever goes over the sea and when it is over navigable water is largely fortuitous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.033" offset="10983528">It has nothing whatever to do with what by analogy we call the navigation of the airplane.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.395" offset="11012995">Now let us take the case of a plane which flies from New York to San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.818" offset="11034624">It leaves the airport and circles over navigable waters as it picks up its westward course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.184" offset="11060120">Then it across the Hudson River, a navigable water way, and after while it causes the Ohio River and then the Mississippi and then the Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.779" offset="11102438">In due course it crosses the Upper Colorado river and the Great Salt Lake, both of which have been held by this Court to be navigable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.158" offset="11140054">It crosses the Sacramento River and then comes down across San Francisco Bay, at a point where the water is very shallow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.514" offset="11173386">Perhaps it circles over the Pacific Ocean before coming in for a landing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.227" offset="11192299">Does it make any sense to say that tort liability is the matter of State law, except in the cases where if there is a crash, the plane chances to hit a water way, navigable by ships with in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.061" offset="11263666">If it bounces on the shore and comes to rest in the Mississippi River, which is essentially what it did here, then it's a matter for admiralty jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.904" offset="11298983">Despite the fact, that the whole venture bears no relation whatever to maritime commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.639" offset="11321971">Yet that was the situation in the Eastern Airlines case, the plane can be rest a few feet in the water in Boston Harbor and that's the case here, for admiralty jurisdiction is claimed to rest on the place where the plane stopped after a land activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2881.779" offset="11630529">Other courts have gone the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.203" offset="11636172">A District Court in New York is held that a women who was injured by a submerged object while bathing at a public beach cannot maintain a suit in admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.649" offset="11673997">And the court below has held in other cases that a swimmer who dove from a municipal dock into 18 inches of water, alleging negligence and falling to construct guard rails and post warning signs could not maintain a suit in admiralty, and in other case where the decedent fell from a dock and was drowned, the Court held there was no maritime jurisdiction and finally in Gowdy against the United States, an electrician was injured while repairing the machinery inside a light house on a breakwater.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.510" offset="11829373">He brought a libel in admiralty, and this was dismissed because the injury bore no relation to maritime commerce and navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.520" offset="11865422">This Court denied certiorari in both two of these Sixth Circuit cases which perhaps even score from the two denials in Eastern Airline case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.889" offset="11914951">Apparently, the earliest case involving an airplane which crashed in navigable water was decided in 1940, nearly 60 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.161" offset="11952044">That was Crawford Bros.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.814" offset="11958627">No. 2 and that's the name of an airplane not of the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.156" offset="11975973">That was the libel in rem for repairs to an airplane which fell into Puget Sound and intervening libellant asserted a salvage claim, and the Court held that there was no jurisdiction in admiralty, saying they are neither on the land nor sea and not being of the sea are restricted in their activities to navigable waters, they are not maritime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.359" offset="12080776">Now, reference may well maybe made to the Death on a High Seas Act which was enacted in 1920, the text of which appears on page 21 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.719" offset="12130200">There is no reference in that statute or in this legislative history to airplanes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.834" offset="12150680">It applies -- it is a Lord Campbell's Act, changing the common laws, so as to provide a cause of action for wrongful death in its terms, occurring on the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.797" offset="12214523">Congress made the Death on The High Seas Act applicable “on the high seas beyond the marine league from the shore of any state,” thus indicating rather clearly, it's understanding that the laws of the States were applicable in territorial waters, which is what we have here, and there was no need to extend admiralty jurisdiction to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.458" offset="12313161">Many courts have held, and I think rightly, that the Death on The High Seas Act applies to airplane accidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.035" offset="12355480">Air crashes do come within the literal language of the statute where the ultimate impact of the crash is on the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.726" offset="12390275">It is true that Congress said that the suit under the Death on The High Seas Act should be in admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.243" offset="12416293">As to this on or in connection with ships, this is of course clear, and within traditional admiralty jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.450" offset="12445132">Congress was not thinking of airplane accidents, when it passed this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.103" offset="12463835">There was no need for it to extend admiralty jurisdiction to airplane crashes causing death, for it would have ample power to provide for recovery for a wrongful death in air accidents under its power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce and not to mention the broad powers which can be found in the Curtis Wright decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.510" offset="12553383">When the statute is properly extended to airplane accidents, it may well be that it should not be constituted to mean that such suits are actually in admiralty, but rather the Congress prescribes that the recovery though at law, should be as if in admiralty, somewhat as the State law was applied by this Court as a part of Federal Law in the marine case decided a year or so ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.048" offset="12663515">That is with the measure of recovery and such things as comparative negligence to be determined by the standards of the admiralty rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.552" offset="12717537">As long as the law stays in its present state, we will have innumerable fruitless borderline problems, such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.314" offset="12748675">And results in particular cases will be fortuitous and understandable only to the most intricately minded lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.479" offset="12777305">There will be disputes as to where tort occurred, the doubts about the question that Mr Justice Stewart asked me, and whether the controlling factor is, where the impact occurred, which made it inevitable, that the plane would crash, or whether the question on which jurisdiction turns is where the plane came to rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.826" offset="12858702">As I see it, there are several ways, in which the question can be disposed off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.967" offset="12879287">At first, the Court can hold, as I think it should, that airplane crashes having no connection with a ship, do not come within admiralty jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.891" offset="12918888">As I have said, this Court would not have to overrule any of its decisions to reach such a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.559" offset="12941563">Such a decision would be in accord with current modern British law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.717" offset="12962252">There is a British statute which provides that His Majesty by Order in Council may provide the court and the rules which apply to airplanes and the only order that has ever been issued is that actions by/or against an airplane, with respect to salvage pilotage and towage, shall be in admiralty, but nothing else, and those three items that makes a certain amount of sense to have it in admiralty.</text>

            <text syncTime="3305.721" offset="13326294">When the admiralty developed, ships had no power of their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.886" offset="13338937">They were large structures floating on the water, subjected to the vagaries of winds and tides and currents and always subject to the risk of collision, no matter how careful the master or the pilot might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.738" offset="13386376">It was in this situation that the rules of comparative negligence developed in admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.396" offset="13412916">No one contends that airplane crew members are entitled to maintenance and cure or that they are wards of the admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.036" offset="13443532">I know of no case applying the admiralty doctrine of general average to an airplane nor is the law of limitation of liability applicable to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.296" offset="13476551">After all, an airplane after it's crashed is probably as worthless in water, as about as worthless as anything can be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.170" offset="13504031">A mortgage on an airplane is not a maritime contact and a suit on such a security interest cannot be brought in admiralty.</text>

            <text syncTime="3496.849" offset="14090742">If the crash occurred in territorial waters, as these two of the crash here, the law of the State would apply, as it would be the case that this plane had ended up on the end of the runway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.069" offset="14131597">If the crash occurred on the high seas, the State Courts would have jurisdiction or the Federal Courts might have jurisdiction in diversity cases or Congress could extend jurisdiction generally to the Federal Courts since Interstate or foreign commerce is necessarily involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.303" offset="14192619">The Death on The High Seas Act would be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.906" offset="14202964">I am troubled about the word admiralty in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.099" offset="14223757">If there was a nonfatal crash, or if there was a suit with respect to loss of property, the courts could fashion a common law remedy or Congress could legislate if that was thought necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.597" offset="14265762">Now my time has expired, but my second alternative would be to say that this case only involves territorial waters and at least as far as territorial waters is concerned, it is not admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.749" offset="14318320">As to the international flight to London, the Court could either hold or leave open the question whether crash is outside the limits of any state or within admiralty jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.718" offset="14374222">My third ground would be essentially that of the Six Circuit Court of Appeals, and that taken in our brief that there must be some kind of a maritime nexus which we contend is not adequately found, merely by reason of the fact that the crash comes to rest in the navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.405" offset="14449037">And finally the Court could hold that, yes, it is admiralty, but the important place if it is admiralty is where the impact takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.403" offset="14496998">Here the impact was over the sine qua non, the event beyond which there was no way to avoid the crash occurred over a land than it was on that ground that the court below decided the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.034" offset="14579545">It seems to me that the Court is confronted here with something in a sense a little like the situation presented by the Genesee Chief, where the Court extended admiralty to the inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.372" offset="14636910">Here we have a new means of transportation, we have two generations of experience with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.530" offset="14665540">Nothing has indicated any reason why it is useful or desirable or necessary to have it in admiralty and the Court might well provide, might well decide that neither within the history nor the proper scope of admiralty, should airplane accidents of this sort be held to be within admiralty jurisdiction.</text>

            <label>Mr. Phillip D. Bostwick</label>
            <text syncTime="3670.006" offset="14783404">Thank you very much, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.896" offset="14786957">I'll be very brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.834" offset="14790719">With regard to few of the question concerning the facts of the allegations of contributory negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.079" offset="14807646">I just would like to clear up that in an un-sworn statement, the Air Traffic Controller did say that he said to the pilots, it looks like a million birds or words of that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.275" offset="14844426">However, there is no tape recording in this case from the tower for an unknown reason and it is undisputed that the pilots did not acknowledge hearing that transmission and asked for a further clearance for takeoff and it is un-contradicted that, on the second clearance, the air traffic controller simply said, “cleared for takeoff” without any reference to the birds at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.765" offset="14930422">And I think it is clear beyond doubt in the regulations that the traffic controllers do have the power to hold aircraft on the runway when there are dangers on the runaway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.513" offset="14977442">Now with regard to the legal points raised by the Solicitor General, I would just simply state that it is true, there are no decisions by this Court concerning aircraft crisis in navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.713" offset="15030209">As the judge pointed out in the dissenting opinion, there are however, about 30 years worth of decisions in the lower Federal Courts concerning this very point, both under the Death on The High Seas Act, the personal injury cases, property damage cases, cases within the general maritime law, under the general maritime law within territorial navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.443" offset="15117145">Without exception, every one of those cases hold that the tort claims arising out of the crash of an aircraft in the navigable waters is cognizable in admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.168" offset="15160090">The case with the court below, is the only case to my knowledge, other than Judge Van Dusen's decision, which was reversed in Weinstein holding that such crash is not cognizable in admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.576" offset="15209723">Therefore, I know that this Court is aware of line of precedent, I also know that it is conceivable, this Court can now enunciate a totally new rule without regard to those lower court decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3787.865" offset="15254862">But if the holding is inconsistent with the cases that hold that you fall off, if you have knocked off a doctor in the navigable waters, it's not an admiralty case?</text>

            <text syncTime="3819.741" offset="15382340">Cleveland's position is that the wharf case is controlling, and we would urge that because of the very playing a game, which was referred to by the Solicitor General and the very complexity and the need to have pre-litigation concerning jurisdictional questions and questions of which substantive law is applicable, that this Court should not follow that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.686" offset="15450154">This court should enunciate a rule, such as found in the Federal Rule of Civil Procedures to reach just median inexpensive determination of the litigation on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.269" offset="15488397">There should be a rule which determines these questions of jurisdiction applicable substantive law without regard to metaphysical phrase such as, where causes of action arise or where torts occur or where the impact occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.946" offset="15543150">This language which is found in the Longshoreman and Harbor Workers' compensation cases, we say, has no place in the future of aviation and space activities, and we would rest primarily on the decisions of the Third Circuit in Weinstein and on the dissenting court in judging of this case.</text>
