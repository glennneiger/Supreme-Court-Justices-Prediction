            <text syncTime="19.763" offset="182418">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.272" offset="196420">This is a Federal Income Tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.281" offset="212511">It is here on the Government’s petition to review a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.548" offset="253576">The case here rises out of one of the interesting developments in modern society.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.373" offset="280848">In California, there is a substantial system of both group medical insurance and group medical practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.488" offset="321285">In this particular case, the medical insurance is provided by Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Incorporated and the medical services are provided by a partnership known as Permanente Medical Group.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.666" offset="398085">The individual taxpayers before the court are members of this partnership or their spouses in cases where joint returns were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.270" offset="444479">The years involved are 1960 and 1961 except in one case where 1962 and 1963 are also involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.552" offset="505605">The case was heard in a District Court on a stipulation of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.632" offset="529951">The basic stipulation appears at pages at 79 to 88 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.383" offset="564955">And the texts to the stipulation are the full text of three substantial documents attached to in a part of the stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.638" offset="605915">And the case turns largely on the effect of those documents and payments made pursuant to them under the Federal Tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.416" offset="653040">The first of these documents is the partnership agreement of the Permanente Medical Group usually referred to in this case simply as Medical Group.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.992" offset="703300">This partnership agreement appears on pages 102 through 113 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.425" offset="745096">The next document appearing at pages 116 through 150 of the appendix is the medical service agreement being a contract entered into as of July 1, 1959 by the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan which is obligated to produce services under its contracts with its members and the Medical Group which thereby undertook the obligation to provide the services.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.848" offset="874768">Under this contract, Medical Group agreed to supply health services to the members of the Health Plan and the Health Plan agreed to make payments to Medical Group.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.585" offset="933700">The question and issue in this case relates to a portion of the payments and I will spell this out in detail in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.528" offset="981452">Finally, there is in the appendix at pages 159 through 199, a trust agreement establishing a retirement plan for the Permanente Medical Group.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.596" offset="1037772">That is the way it is entitled at the beginning, trust agreement, retirement plan for the Permanente Medical Group on page 159.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.590" offset="1077687">This is a typical non-vested retirement plan providing for benefits for physicians only and only to the physicians who persists in their connection with Medical Group or related groups for period stated in the trust.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="294.000" offset="1279352">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.439" offset="1281128">The plan covers physicians who are employees of Permanente Medical Group as well as physician to our partners in Permanente Medical Group.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.392" offset="1324910">The payments involved in this case were made by Health Plan to the trust pursuant to the agreement between Health Plan and the partnership at Medical Group and let us now turn more specifically to the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.162" offset="1400038">I would like to call the Court’s attention to page 122 of the appendix which is in the agreement between Health Plan and Medical Group.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.863" offset="1450820">Section (B) (3) of the agreement, recites this.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.491" offset="1473285">This is near the top of page 122.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.894" offset="1486973">Health Plan desires to arrange by contract for all medical services in the service area required to satisfy or convenient or incidental in connection with satisfying the medical service obligations provided in membership contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.725" offset="1558235">Medical Group agrees to provide such medical services for the consideration and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.875" offset="1610898">Thus all of the payments provided by the agreement are expressly stated to be in consideration of the services rendered by Medical Group.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.783" offset="1654471">Similarly at the bottom of page 124 of the appendix, it is agreed that and I quote the last two lines on 124, “With the end of service area, Medical Group shall provide to all members, all medical services required by or incident to membership contracts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="408.952" offset="1739212">And then at the top of page 126, appears Section (C) (3) of the contract under the heading, Compensation for Medical Services.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.020" offset="1787486">And the first sentence of (C) (3) reads “as full consideration for rendering medical services as required by Section (C) (1) and (C) (2), Medical Group shall receive the compensation provided in part three here up.”</text>
            <text syncTime="440.592" offset="1865749">And this leads us to Part 3 of the contract, Article H beginning on page 137 of the appendix and continuing for the next several pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.584" offset="1933667">It is there provided in the introduction to Article H, “As base compensation to Medical Group for Medical Services to be provided by Medical Group hereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.441" offset="2001168">Health Plan shall pay to Medical Group the amounts specified in this Article H.”</text>
            <text syncTime="483.147" offset="2035963">And then each one then provides for the per member price and provides for a payment based on the number of members.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.970" offset="2083297">The initial per member price for July 1959 and each exceeding month, it appeared near the bottom of page 137 was $2.61329 per member per month.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.291" offset="2148498">But continuing with Article H, it appears that this base compensation consists of several items.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.030" offset="2199489">Incidentally, I may say that if the time the contract was entered into, there were 350,000 members that meant coverage of sum of 900,000 persons because members were families.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.486" offset="2261347">I understand that something close to three million persons are now covered by the General Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.922" offset="2307009">But there are further provisions for adjustment to the per member price in Section H-2 and H-3 on pages 138 in the top of page 139 and then we come to the paragraph which give rise to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.819" offset="2390601">This is paragraph H-4 on page 139 of the appendix and it is headed, Provision for Savings and Retirement Program for Physicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.503" offset="2457370">And since this is the key to the case, I would like to read the paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.340" offset="2484746">In the event that Medical Group establishes a savings and retirement plan or other deferred compensation plan approved by Health Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.441" offset="2533125">Health Plan will pay in addition to all other sums payable by Health Plan under this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.653" offset="2565935">The contributions required under such plan to the extent that such contributions exceed amounts if any contributed by a physicians as the plan was established, the physicians made no direct contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.985" offset="2627271">Provided, however, that Health Plan shall commence contribution on July 1, 1959 and provided further that Health Plan’s obligation to make such contributions shall continue, only so long as this agreement or any continuation or extension generally similar to this agreement that shall remain into -- remain in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.206" offset="2724237">And it appears later in the appendix at 162 that the rate of health plans contribution to this trust shall be 12 cents per member per month.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.242" offset="2796335">And with 350,000 members, that worth out to about $500,000 per year and the record shows that over a period of four years something over $2 million was paid by Health Plan into the retirement trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.001" offset="2879404">Following the execution of the medical service agreement, that is the agreement between Health Plan and Medical Group, the trust agreement was entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.770" offset="2926425">It was actually signed about December 30, 1959, but it was effective as of July 1, 1959, the date when the agreement between Health Services and Medical Group became effective and nothing turns on the fact that there was some delay and working out and finally signing the trust agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.859" offset="3018794">As I’ve already indicated the trust agreement is entitled retirement plan for the Permanente Medical Group.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.187" offset="3052126">And it is a typical non-vested retirement trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.870" offset="3074800">It provides for benefits only to physicians, but it includes not only the partners in Medical Group, but also physicians who are employees of the group.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.229" offset="3128299">It provides for tentative credits for each physician based upon his age, experience, and length of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.348" offset="3168737">It provides that these credits may be forfeited if the physician leaves the partnership or its employee except under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.397" offset="3204995">In that event, the forfeited amounts are creditable to the other physicians who are beneficiaries of the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.119" offset="3239894">As the respondents here agree and expressly stated page 4 of their brief, in no event is any amount refundable to Health Plan.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="795.837" offset="3286706">Mr. Solicitor General, if a physician’s interest a partner physician’s interest is forfeited then I think take it the Internal Revenue Service in some way would recognize the extent of his, shall I call it loss at that time in the year of forfeiture?</text>

            <text syncTime="818.320" offset="3376671">I think we get to that question only if we assume that the payments are income to the trust, but if it is decided as we contend that the payments are always income to Medical Group then it simply becomes a question of what is the distributable share of each partners’ income in the trust each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.876" offset="3466846">And the payment to the trust we contend is income to the Medical Group partnership and it’s a part of the income which must be shown on the information return of the partnership and allocated to the partners and proportion to their interest in the partnership income.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.925" offset="3551065">In that so, what happens to any particular physicians interest and a trust is an irrelevant as far as this case is concern.</text>

            <text syncTime="873.239" offset="3596309">That I understand, but I wondered whether he doesn’t have a loss of some kind at the time of forfeiture that might be assertable?</text>

            <text syncTime="885.169" offset="3644061">He simply has a -- perhaps a reduced income from the trust which will affect him.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.733" offset="3670288">But this is from point of view of the tax law as we contend the same as if the payment was made to Medical Group and Medical Group then made a payment to the retirement trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.189" offset="3740087">That would not be income to the partnership when it was paid to the retirement -- to the partner when it was paid to the retirement trust and it would not be a loss to the partner when it --if he had a forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.121" offset="3795884">I think this all turns on the somewhat subtle but nevertheless controlling issue in this case, are these payments income to the Medical Group which we contend they are or are they income to the partnership -- to the retirement trust which is the basis which the court below decided?</text>

            <text syncTime="962.239" offset="3952306">And are those employees tax on the deferred income on the year in which it’s contributed to the pension fund or when they received it at the end of the line?</text>

            <text syncTime="1016.434" offset="4169122">This plan is quite clearly, not within Section 401. In the first place, it is discriminatory because it applies only to the top-salaried people, the physicians, but even more clearly, it is not exclusively for employees and their beneficiaries which are the only things to which the Retirement Trust Provisions in Section 401 apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.744" offset="4274343">In the years involved here, at least 1960, 1961, there was no provision whatever in the law for a retirement, deduction of retirement benefits for self-employed persons and partners are of course self-employed persons as partners in law offices have known with respect to the tax law for a long time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1173.571" offset="4797628">Mr. Justice, I think my answer was quite and adequate and perhaps illustrates the difficulty of the case to one who has been working on it for months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.743" offset="4842350">It is quite plain that the increase in income, not offset by a corresponding withdrawal of funds from the partnership would increase each partner’s basis in the partnership and would be taken into account in one way or another.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="1201.099" offset="4907760">Probably, it matters due from the partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.117" offset="4919881">Incidentally, in the foldout, just before page 203 is the computation of the amounts allocated to each partner in this case by the revenue agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.075" offset="4979649">And I think this illustrates the same thing because I believe that there was an error by the revenue agent in calculating the deficiencies because he apparently allocated the payments -- payment to the trust on the basis of the retirement formula in the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.128" offset="5051852">But the payment should have been allocated only to partners and to partners on a pro-rata basis since that it is the way that all earnings and excess of withdrawing accounts were distributable under the partnership agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.851" offset="5110784">Now this question is covered by paragraph 24 of the stipulation at page 87 down at the bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.961" offset="5143176">The partners agree -- the parties agree that any recomputations of the various sums involved in these actions which may be required by Court’s adjudication herein will be made, verified, and settled by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.551" offset="5201586">And I’m -- I feel fairly confident that after this Court’s decision that can be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.626" offset="5221857">But in the event, that counsel cannot agree upon such recomputations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.761" offset="5242441">The sums may be settled by the Court upon application in 10 days notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.306" offset="5268564">And I mentioned this because it may be what through the court below of the track, same way that I think I was throwing off the track and I would like to avoid suggesting the same error here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.925" offset="5331048">This case can be made to appear and very likely is, very complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.546" offset="5357589">There is even a considerable discussion in the respondent’s brief to the effect that the Government is preceding on the entity theory of partnerships while they said that the conduit theory is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.359" offset="5400848">It seems odd that we should still be discussing such things in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.430" offset="5433135">I think it is by now accepted that partnerships are both entities and aggregates and are so treated in the tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.980" offset="5463333">They are treated as entities were the purpose of filing information returns, but partnerships are not taxed under our law and never have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.779" offset="5502516">The tax is imposed on the partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.852" offset="5514742">They are not taxed on their income actually received from the partnership, what they are taxed on is their distributive share of the partnership income whether they received or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.565" offset="5573674">I don’t want to oversimplify this case, but I would like to suggest that the question at issue here was resolved many years ago, and that the case on careful examination involves no question which has not been long established in our tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.005" offset="5655385">The first of two cases is the venerable classic, Lucas against Earl decided in 1930.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.484" offset="5697285">In an opinion by Justice Holmes, that case involved an agreement between a husband and wife under which the income of the husband became a joint property of both spouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.206" offset="5768234">It was contended and the Ninth Circuit held that income was taxable half to the husband and half to the wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.630" offset="5797909">But this Court reversed Justice Holmes and his one own opinion said that, “This case is not to be decided by attenuated subtleties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.661" offset="5870007">There is doubt that the statute could tax salaries to those who earned them and provide that the tax could not be escaped by anticipatory arrangements and contracts, however, skillfully devised to prevent the salary when paid from vesting even for a second in the man who earned it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.485" offset="5941269">That seems to us the import of the statute before us and we think that no distinction can be taken according to the motives leading to the arrangement by which the fruits are attributed to a different tree on that from which they grew.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.222" offset="6008247">In the other case in Heiner and Mellon in 304 U.S. that involved a partnership and involved income which under the applicable state law could not be paid and the court held that it was nevertheless income to the partnership and came within the distributive share.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.169" offset="6116080">Let me turn to a hypothetical example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.187" offset="6124126">Let’s assume a large law firm with a hundred or more partners and his many associates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.654" offset="6145964">For convenience, I’ll call it Ropes and Cromwell. Let us assume that it has a large and important client which we’ll call International Conglomerates, Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.314" offset="6188596">The client has worldwide operations and it’s constantly confronted with legal problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.588" offset="6209703">It has its own legal staff whether it relays heavenly on the services provided by Ropes and Cromwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.948" offset="6235199">International Conglomerates is much interested in the continuity of the services of the individual members of Ropes and Cromwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.862" offset="6270830">In the past, Ropes and Cromwell has billed at appropriate intervals and these have been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.784" offset="6294549">Now, let us suppose that Ropes and Cromwell suggested the corporation that hereafter 10% of the bill be paid to the law firm’s retirement fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.087" offset="6331747">Obviously enough, this would make no difference under Lucas and Earl, and the Culbertson case, the entire amount would be taxable to the partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.732" offset="6370304">I don’t think it would make any difference that the law firm’s retirement fund was a non-vested one under which no partner had any immediate right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.818" offset="6410637">The payment to the retirement plan would still be income to the partnership of Ropes and Cromwell because it is a payment made on account of services rendered by the partnership and taxable to the partnership under Lucas and Earl.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.605" offset="6469778">Well now, let us suppose that instead of a payment to the firm’s retirement fund, the payments made to a trust for such of the wives of the partners at Ropes and Cromwell as survived the partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.488" offset="6517321">Here, no partner would have any right to receive any specific amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.714" offset="6534248">I suggest though that the payment would still be clearly income to the partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.047" offset="6559535">And finally, let us assume that International Conglomerates came to Ropes and Cromwell and said, “We are very much interested in the continuity of your firm and then encouraging people to stay here in order that they may have background and experience in our work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.066" offset="6627662">With the result that when we have a problem, we may go to someone who already knows a great deal about our business and the way we operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.232" offset="6660263">Accordingly, we want to join with you in the establishing a non-vested pension plan under which we will make regular annual payments and the plan will eventually provide retirement payments, but only to those members, employees of the firm who satisfied length of service requirements.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.522" offset="6737481">But it seems to me is what we have here putting the respondent’s case in its strongest terms, but such a payment would still be a payment by International Conglomerates, Inc. on account of services rendered by Ropes and Cromwell and would thus, under Lucas and Earl, and Culbertson be income to Ropes and Cromwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.274" offset="6836433">Since it is income to Ropes and Cromwell, each partner of Ropes and Cromwell would be taxable on his distributive share of that income, whether distributed or not and even though it could not be distributed as this Court held in Heiner and Mellon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.345" offset="6928802">In this case, the payments made to the retirement fund by Health Plan were made on account of the services rendered by Medical Group and pursuant to the compensation contract between Health Plan and Medical Group, which specifically provided for the payment of this retirement amounts as part of the compensation, that’s in quotation mark “Payable to Medical Group, for medical services to be provided my Medical Group hereunder.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.144" offset="7067982">The whole point here is that payments are income to the partnership which performed the services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.150" offset="7095986">We do not get to the question of the right to receive payments from the retirement trust until the payments made by the Health Plan for the services of Medical Group are treated as income to the retirement trust, but the payments are not income to the retirement trust, they are income to Medical Group under the clear teaching of Lucas against Earl.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.631" offset="7201938">And since the payments are income to Medical Group, it does not matter that the partnership Medical Group by its contract cost these amounts to be payable to the retirement fund in such a way that no one had an immediate vested right to get cash and no partner could currently receive his share.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.200" offset="7288142">In this respect, the situation is like that in other good old case, Griffiths against the Commissioner, where the Court held that the taxability of the income currently could not be defeated despite the technically elegant arrangement which had been set up to divert the taxability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.412" offset="7377063">For the reasons which I have indicated since the diversion of earned income that is the amounts paid pursuant to a contract for personal services rendered runs directly follow that one of the fundamental principles of income taxation that earned income is taxable to him who earns it, no matter what diversionary arrangements is made for its payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.176" offset="7484061">The decision below is erroneous and should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1868.602" offset="7577788">Let me first refer to his example about the mythical law firm of Ropes and Cromwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.137" offset="7599940">He suggested that the facts there were that the law firm suggested the 10% of what had been its normal retainer should be paid to a trust which was to establish a retirement plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.380" offset="7652916">Let me read you what the party stipulated in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.511" offset="7669426">The primary purpose of the -- I beg your pardon, it is on page 83 of the record, Your Honor and it is in the stipulation of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.944" offset="7703176">It will also be -- it will also appear virtually in haec verba in the opinion of the Court of Appeals which is on page 32 of the appendix to the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.097" offset="7747793">The stipulation is that the primary purpose of the retirement plan was to create an incentive for physicians to remain with Medical Group or other groups of physicians contracting to serve Health Plan members and thus to ensure Health Plan, that it would have a stable and reliable group of physicians providing medical services to its members and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.792" offset="7846536">Then it states that the retirement plan was patterned after one which was in effect already in Southern California between another Medical Group and the same Health Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.032" offset="7887496">And finally, that the payments which Health Plan agreed to and did make to the plan were paid solely to fund the retirement plan and were not otherwise available to Medical Group or to the individual members or employees thereof.</text>

            <text syncTime="1990.670" offset="8066069">The opinion of the Court of Appeals is the more of a voluminous and it speaks of the facts more freely than the District Court does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.597" offset="8101804">There were no findings of fact in the District Court other than the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.718" offset="8118209">The Court of Appeals at page -- which in the opinion will appear at page 32 of the petition for certiorari and again, I might make quotations from page 39 of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.825" offset="8162722">This is the appendix to the petition and in that case I would call your attention to the shift of pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.908" offset="8186964">The Court of Appeals says the primary purpose of the retirement plan as to ensure Kaiser a stable and reliable pool of physicians providing medical service to its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.332" offset="8232730">The plan accomplishes this purpose by creating an incentive for physicians to devote their careers to Kaiser Members and so on. Now, this is virtually from the stipulation in haec verba.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.043" offset="8275571">But then at page 39 of the appendix to the petition, the court interprets that language again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.821" offset="8306604">In distinguishing a circuit court case, Hulbert which had been cited by the Government below, the court said that Hulbert was not in point because there the partnership had it chosen not to enter the sales agreement or had it entered a different one on different terms would have received the whole of the payments as current income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.255" offset="8396361">In this case, and I am quoting the Court of Appeals, “The party stipulated that the payments which Kaiser agreed to and did make to the trust were paid solely to fund the retirement plan and were not otherwise available to Permanente, that’s the partnership, or to the individual members or employees thereof.</text>

            <text syncTime="2250.267" offset="9104488">In paragraph 16 of the stipulation on page 84 of the record which you had earlier read to us, the last sentence there, that the payments which Health Plan agreed to and did make to the trust were made solely to fund the retirement plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2689.898" offset="10862947">Nor is there any evidence in the record to suggest that Permanente agreed to accept less direct compensation from Kaiser in exchange for the retirement plan payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.741" offset="10906311">That Kaiser would not have been willing to make the payments except into the trusts under the conditions imposed is consistent with the primary purpose of the retirement plan to ensure Kaiser a stable and reliable group of physicians.</text>

            <text syncTime="2928.647" offset="11817984">We seek to rely up on the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.503" offset="11829373">We do not believe that the Government’s position based upon Lucas against Earl is some because it is not derived from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.594" offset="11865736">Lucas against Earl is certainly a distinguished and important case but to illustrate, Your Honor, how statutes may change what has been the law in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.904" offset="11907009">If Mr. Earl is still alive, he can derive the benefits from the statute which he could not derive under the method he attempted in Lucas against Earl because all he needs to do now is file a joint return with his wife and he would get the split income benefits that he sought by the devise that was denied to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.147" offset="11991960">So statutes do change things and we rely upon the statutes, and we have discussed this as a considerable length in our brief and I would like -- it’s difficult to discuss a statute in all oral argument without the statute before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.200" offset="12056221">But I -- this is not such a conflict statute as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.660" offset="12082030">First, the Section 701 which appears in the appendix to respondent’s brief which is to white one, it appears at page 3 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.556" offset="12137618">The appendix is separated from the rest by a blue insert sheet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.387" offset="12156949">It says that a partnership as such shall not be subject to the income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.577" offset="12177638">Persons carrying on business as partners shall be liable for income tax only in their separate or individual capacities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.421" offset="12209089">The point that we see in that Section is that Congress is thinking of a partnership not as an entity conducting business but rather as an aggregate of individuals, of persons carrying on business as partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.823" offset="12270634">It is consistent with that trust that emphasis that Section 703 which appears on page 5 of our appendix says that the taxable income of a partnership shall be computed in the same manner as in the case of an individual except that and none of the exceptions is applicable here and the Government has never contended that any of them was applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.932" offset="12367078">So it says that the taxable income of a partnership shall be computed in the same manner as in the case of an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.194" offset="12404172">There history behind these projections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.349" offset="12416815">They are derived -- the ones which -- the language which I have read is derived without significant change from the prior Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.698" offset="12450147">This Court construed the prior code in Neuberger to adopt the context then before it, the aggregate theory rather than the entity theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.810" offset="12502601">There are lots of words used for these theories and there the Court used both the entity language and the unit language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.954" offset="12531231">And it also referred to the partnership as an association of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.013" offset="12551398">And it allowed a partner to offset his individual non-capital losses against his share of the partnership’s non-capital losses even though the statutes could more readily who have been construed in the other way under the doctrine of ejusdem generis which the Court refused to apply because it thought and I “that Congress has recognize the partnership both as a business unit and as an association of individuals.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.586" offset="12669680">But they said this weakens rather than strengthens the Government’s argument that the privileges are distinct and that the unit characteristics of the partnership must be emphasized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.926" offset="12715029">And interestingly, at that point they cited among the cases a case from the Court of Claims that Craik case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.944" offset="12747107">And the Craik case involved a nonresident who was a member of the resident partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.205" offset="12772185">The question was whether he was taxable upon the entire distributive share of his income of the partnership or merely a portion of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.008" offset="12803427">Some of the partnership income was also from foreign sources as he resided abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.372" offset="12824848">And the Court of Claims used the language undoubtedly referred to by this Court in referring to the Craik case that at common law, each partner was the agent for the other partners in carrying up their common purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.099" offset="12879809">The income earned by the partnership was regarded as having been earned by the individual partners either by himself individually or through his agents, the other partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.405" offset="12929024">The court below used the term that the partnership was acting only as the agent of its members and it used that in this context, in this sense, in the petition and in the brief, both the Government has sought to make capital of the use of the term agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.881" offset="12998928">But this is the classical concept of the relationship of one partner to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.654" offset="13022020">And in the Craik case which this Court spoke of approvingly in Neuberger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.457" offset="13041246">The court did say that each partner was regarded as having earned the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.146" offset="13063920">The statute says that in Section 701 that the businesses done by individuals or by persons doing business in the form of a partnership and it shows that the income of the partnership shall be computed in the same manner as in the case of an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.830" offset="13134660">If those instructions are applied then we see that the fact that the payments into the trust by Health Plan create only forfeitable and contingent rights and the taxpayers is controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.190" offset="13196100">Under volumes of doctrine including many decisions from this Court whether on the cash or the accrual basis, a taxpayer does not have income so long as his claims to whatever the property is remained contingent and forfeitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.728" offset="13270288">That rule has been applied consistently in deferred compensation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.401" offset="13296933">Lucas against Earl has never been applied in deferred compensation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.202" offset="13320129">It has been cited by the Government time after time in deferred compensation cases as it was in both courts here and it has been rejected in all of those cases including the two courts below here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.699" offset="13374151">And the reason is, Mrs. Earl received money in 1921 and it was at that time that Mr. Earl was held taxable upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.775" offset="13414484">He was not held taxable upon any income in an earlier year before somebody received it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.402" offset="13441024">And so it should be here, these individuals should be taxable when they receive their income and not before.</text>

            <text syncTime="3351.513" offset="13509465">The Code has a further answer to the Government’s position and that is, it says, that this is Section 704 it appears in the appendix to our brief and that the relevant part is on page 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.920" offset="13575084">It’s the first words of Section 704.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.840" offset="13586683">A partners’ distributive share of income gain, loss, deduction or credit shall and so on be determined by the partnership agreement then it goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.999" offset="13631404">And I was mistaken, this is the critical language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.948" offset="13639137">The partner’s distributive share of any item of income shall be determined in accordance with this distributive share unless the agreement of the parties provides to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.975" offset="13679261">The point is that a partner is not taxable on -- inflexibly on “X” percentage of the net income of the partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.050" offset="13715623">It used to be under the old Code.</text>

            <text syncTime="3406.471" offset="13729207">His distributive share is of an item of gross income as well as of net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.210" offset="13760240">The purpose of this was to permit persons who attribute or contribute appreciated property to a partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.438" offset="13789080">And by a partnership, interest based on the appreciated value to be the sole taxpayers on that appreciated value if the property is sold for a profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.501" offset="13829413">So that the property or the gain which the partners have bought by admitting, the new partner will not be taxable to all of them proportionately.</text>
