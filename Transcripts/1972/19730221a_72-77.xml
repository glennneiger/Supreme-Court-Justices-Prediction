            <text syncTime="12.447" offset="153161">I think we should first realize what we do have in this lawsuit and what we do not have in the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.953" offset="179179">I direct the Court's or invite the Court's attention to the appendix at page 19 which contains the complaint of a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.148" offset="224005">The second paragraph thereof the plaintiff seek a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunction, enjoining the defendants from providing or permitting the distribution or sale of state purchased or owned textbooks to private, racially segregated schools or academies.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.111" offset="315852">This case is a fine drawn legal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.600" offset="333824">It is not a question of whether or not the 170 challenged academies have a racially motivated admission policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.877" offset="382830">It is one which deals basically with whether or not the State of Mississippi can lend text books to the pupils attending racially segregated private academies regardless, regardless of how they got that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.534" offset="465481">Now if the Court will look at the appendix, at page 22 in which the relief requested is that before textbooks can be allowed to, here they say, “Private schools and all students,” there must first be a showing to the District Court that the private school is racially integrated both as to students and faculty and in a conjunctive, has not have the effect of frustrating or impeding the establishment of racially integrated public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.948" offset="619186">Now that, Your Honors is a burden that no private school in the United States that I believe, I know of could carry which shows a fine line which this particular case takes.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.473" offset="677282">They are saying they won’t relieve to this extent, unless the private schools now can show that they have an open enrollment admission policy, but that they must be racially integrated both in faculty and in students.</text>

            <label>Mr. William A. Allain</label>
            <text syncTime="293.397" offset="1276949">Now, I say that I do not to believe the issues framed here or is brought as Your Honor addresses himself for the simple reason that there is no proof in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.576" offset="1317700">No attempted proof by the plaintiff to show what the particular admission policy was of the 107 academies.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.024" offset="1355421">In fact, the proof is just the opposite shown by cross-examination by the defendants that that did have, the 107 have an open enrollment policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.631" offset="1397948">It is either on the minutes, it is oral, verbal and sometimes it went so far as be advertised in the newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.152" offset="1435982">So I think from the fact that the case in the lower court was not tried on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.494" offset="1457298">There was no attempt to show by the plaintiffs that that was a closed admission policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.482" offset="1481331">This case is drawn on the same fine lines of the tuition cases in which the courts held that the mere fact that they were racially segregated, not how they got there, but that is a different rationale, a different principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.329" offset="1544652">For the simple reason in the tuition cases, the Coffey I, Coffey II, the Poindexter cases, Griffin case found that the State of Mississippi and the State of Louisiana and Virginia were operating not necessarily racially discriminatory white academies, but they had in one -- they're still operating a dual school system because in that case, under I guess the under the rationale of Burton case, the sifting of the facts and the circumstances show that they were actually in partnership with the private schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.015" offset="1695431">The tuition was the basic income of the private schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.403" offset="1712985">So instead of having an Allen case or instead of even having a Burton case, you had a Brown and Griffin case which did not depend upon a finding by the Court that there was an open or a closed admission policies for -- as the private school were concerned because of the mere fact that they were predominantly white, put the State of Mississippi and Louisiana in operating a dual school system again under the freedom of choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.682" offset="1826147">Now we say to the Court that we think that this case regardless of how it is taken is controlled by the line of cases of Allen and Cochran, the transportation and textbook cases and the plaintiffs try to get past the rationale and holding in those cases by saying, “Well this is a Fourteenth Amendment case and not a First Amendment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="454.456" offset="1921233">I say to the Court that the First Amendment, the establishment clause of the First Amendment, now I know Mr. Chief Justice has spoke in the Tilton about the internal tension between the establishment clause and the exercise clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.139" offset="1975881">But the establishment clause has been held by this Court as absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.639" offset="2001899">The exercise clause is not absolute as to actions of individuals and that’s in the Jacobs case which allowed inoculations and I think the Prince case against Massachusetts was the labor, the child labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.225" offset="2060309">But you are talking about an absolute in the establishment clause and therefore we submit to the Court that the measuring stick for the establishment clause of the First Amendment is more stringent and more stringent than that of the Fourteenth Amendment whose contours as this Court has said have not been concretely established to allow for flexibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.188" offset="2156126">The measuring stick apparently in the Fourteenth Amendment cases would be the Burton case where we must sift the facts and look at the circumstances to see whether or not a state has put itself in partnership with the academies.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.947" offset="2219133">And counsel and the plaintiffs go further and say “Yes” but you are not controlled by Burton for the simple reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.502" offset="2241390">Green and Swan say that the State of Mississippi has an affirmative duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.941" offset="2267094">So it is actually not the Fourteenth Amendment per se which the plaintiffs are riding in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.360" offset="2292799">It’s the First Amendment with the gloss put up on it by Swan and Green upon any state which has had a dual school system.</text>

            <text syncTime="596.041" offset="2487568">Under the rationale of the New Jersey case which held -- of course the Everson case which it held that transportation did not violate the establishment clause in the New Jersey case.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.320" offset="2532603">But the affirmative duty doctrine is -- has never been completely defined by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.635" offset="2561964">How far does a state have to go in order to do away with any, anything which interferes as the plaintiffs say that the academies interfere with the unitary school system in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.708" offset="2626226">That taken to its logical conclusion and the plaintiff’s are asking and are saying that the state can give no aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.819" offset="2666663">Now that taken to its illogical logical extension would be that they must cut off water, sewer, electricity.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.068" offset="2699682">Now, I know this sounds absurd because Mr. Justice Rehnquist in the Moose Lodge case and Mr. Chief Justice in the Lemon case and Mr. Brennan in the concurring of the Lemon case stated that this were benefits which could flow to private schools, to church schools or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.145" offset="2791946">But if we take this affirmative duty that the plaintiffs are tempting to urge upon the Court, then how far is it necessary for the State of Mississippi or Louisiana or any other state to go to get rid of what they say are the private segregated schools regardless of how they get there which is interfering --</text>

            <text syncTime="1161.021" offset="4747473">We say to the court that the statute was enacted in 1940 without any racial motives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.377" offset="4776835">It in no way established any dual school system and it no way established any racially segregated private schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="1183.285" offset="4836498">I would further say to the Court that there is one finding by this Court, by the District Court which we think that unless it's manifestly wrong, this Court should affirm and this Court I think has been on record since the Brown decision in saying the District Court and the trial court is a court that must look at the factual situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1222.310" offset="4992606">There’s no timing problem in this particular case because it was way back in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.086" offset="5019669">The District Court found in its opinion that since the issuance of free textbooks to students attending private schools has failed to defeat the establishment of a statewide unitary school system in Mississippi and since plaintiffs are themselves receiving their free textbook, there is serious question as to whether plaintiffs are threatened with the irreparable injury which is requisite to injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.523" offset="5129488">Further the Court found there is no showing that any child enrolled in private schools, is deprived of free textbooks would withdraw from private school and subsequently enroll into public schools now unitary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.739" offset="5190301">Further there is a finding by the Court in the evidence in the lower court, I mean in the depositions that the withdrawal from the pupils of this particular aid would not in anyway which is just $6.00 a year per pupil substantially effect the 107 private schools which are under attack in this particular lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.179" offset="5292074">We say to the Court in closing that we feel that the opinion of the District Court is bottomed on the facts in that particular case and the law has been the teachings of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.577" offset="5337631">And that even in the two Poindexter cases which this Court affirmed, Judge Wisdom speaking for the District Court in similar situations in Louisiana that had a dual school system in tuition cases, distinguished those particular cases from textbooks and free luncheon and the other benevolent gifts that had been given to charitable and educational institutions throughout the years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1423.262" offset="5796446">You said I -- what you're seeking which is a temporary restraining order on -- to prevent the sale or distribution to private racially segregated schools on the counties and then over on page 22 when you set down the -- your prayer for relief, you were asked for an injunction against the distribution of textbooks to students in schools unless those schools first established that the private school is racially integrated both as to students and faculty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.102" offset="5927790">Now to me, those mean two separate things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.716" offset="5942209">In other words, I should suppose that a school could in fact have nothing, but Negro children and yet not be a segregated school, but certainly it would not be an integrated school.</text>

            <text syncTime="1497.200" offset="6092152">However, what we’re trying to get out is subterfuge, alleged policies of open admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.824" offset="6122663">Now in the Green versus Kennedy case, a three-judge District Court established a series of requirements that private schools would have to satisfy in order to be eligible for tax exempt status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.050" offset="6179610">The record shows, according to Commissioner Thrower that there are five or six academies which have qualified for tax exemption which by -- which only the most naive would consider truly open.</text>

            <text syncTime="1541.344" offset="6268740">The Indianola Academy is presently a tax exempt institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.269" offset="6288488">If you look at our brief, page 18, you will find an analysis of what occurred in the Indianola school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.464" offset="6341256">The Indianola Academy presently enrolls all white children residing in the municipality of Indianola and that academy’s enrollment tripled in the middle of the school year immediately upon this Court's decision in Alexander versus Holmes County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.248" offset="6408338">Now we submit that what we’re really getting at here in trying to establish a standard for a private academy is to be certain that the standard of proof of open admissions is very, very high that there is no excuse for IRS’ approval of the Indianola Academy as a school with an open admissions policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.623" offset="6501857">According to IRS data, there are at least ten schools which are clearly segregationists which are presently tax exempt not withstanding Green versus Kennedy.</text>
