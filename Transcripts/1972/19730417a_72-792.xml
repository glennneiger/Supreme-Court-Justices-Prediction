            <label>Ms. Jean M. Coon</label>
            <text syncTime="56.111" offset="327868">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.403" offset="332988">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.647" offset="345945">In directing argument on the merits in this case, this Court postponed the question of jurisdiction, that issue has been briefed by both appellants and I wish to comment only briefly on jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.888" offset="394951">The complaint in the instant case attack New York’s work referrals statutes claiming that they conflict not only with the provisions of the Federal Social Security Act, but also that they violated both the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.362" offset="456808">Those latter issues were extensively briefed and argued by all parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.098" offset="475721">The District Court in its decision rejected the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment claims, but did discuss them at length and did consider them substantial constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.383" offset="520861">Even though it eventually found they’re not to be sustained on the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.779" offset="538520">It is our understanding of the decisions of this Court that as long as the constitutional questions raised are substantial a statutory three-judge court is properly convene and consequently in appeal directly to this Court is also proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.762" offset="594422">Even though the District Court ultimately rejects claim constitutional invalidity.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.538" offset="621484">We might also observe that if this is not the case, then this Court should consider whether as held by the Second Circuit Hagans case cited in the appellants’ briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.799" offset="658578">There was substantial federal question at all present in the case, efficient to confer jurisdiction even upon a single district judge.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="147.077" stopTime="162.948">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="147.077" offset="691702">Well, I presume Mrs. Coon that even if -- if this Court were to determine if the constitutional question has been insubstantial under Bailey against Patterson, and the Phillips case, we would have authority to remand for hearing before a single district judge on your appeal, are you not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jean_m_coon" startTime="162.948" stopTime="390.394">
            <label>Ms. Jean M. Coon</label>
            <text syncTime="162.948" offset="755127">Oh!</text>
            <text syncTime="163.132" offset="755858">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.625" offset="757844">That’s -- that’s entirely -- that’s entirely true, but we are also suggesting this Court the possibility that the Court may adopt the Hagans case rule in the Second Circuit that if the question is found not to be substantial, federal constitutional question at all that it’s a matter for the state courts and not for the federal courts to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.380" offset="840913">Our main argument is of course address to the merits of the state statutes here at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.046" offset="863587">Briefly, the statutes at the time of the commencement of the action provided that all social services recipients in the aid for dependent children and then the totally, also the totally state-funded home relief categories, must if employable register with the state department -- or State Employment Service of the State Department of Labor report semi-monthly to that office for job referral and to pick up welfare checks and to accept employment when offered and further provided for public works project employment for persons not placed in private employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.398" offset="1016978">The work referral statute also provides a definition of those who would be considered unemployable.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.562" offset="1041638">The aged, the sick and disabled, children in school, vocational trainees and mothers whose presence was needed on the home for care for children or those mothers for whom daycare services were not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.845" offset="1098794">Subsequent to the commencement of this action, the referral statute was amendment to provide that the original definition of employability would apply only to the home relief recipients and that as to ADC recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.816" offset="1158666">There employability would be determined under the federal work incentive program definitions except that the child care exemption was continued in the same language as that originally provided in the 1971 Enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.864" offset="1218853">Furthermore, the 1972 Amendments specifically stated that prior to the time that a work instead of program registrant is actually enrolled in participating in the Federal WIN program but the work referral and check pickup provisions would continue to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.188" offset="1292100">The statute here at issue was part of a general welfare reform program initiated by the Governor of the State of New York and a message to the legislature in March of 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.749" offset="1338389">Briefly, the purpose of the legislation was stated to be -- to see to it that we not only continue to meet the basic needs of those who cannot do for themselves, but that we also to encourage the young and able-bodied, temporarily in need of assistance to achieve the education and skills, the motivation and the determination that will make it possible for them to become increasingly self-sufficient independent citizens who can contribute to and share in the responsibility for their families and our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.493" offset="1461373">With the advent of the state’s work referral program, adopted as a part of the reform package.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.729" offset="1486242">The employable recipients of public assistance in HR and ADC categories were subject to job referral under either one of two programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.122" offset="1523858">The Federal WIN program applicable only to the ADC recipients provides for job or training referral of certain categories of recipients in a limited geographical area, 12 out of the States 58 welfare districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.048" offset="1583522">All employable HR recipients and employable ADC recipients not participating in WIN, our referable to employment under the state statute and also under the statute to public work’s employment, although the public work feature as to ADC recipient was never implemented because of HEW objections.</text>

            <text syncTime="447.967" offset="1895215">In other words, in annually they are initial new contracts entered into with the Secretary of Labor which provides for the number of persons who will be serviced under the WIN program and also provides for the federal funding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1129.949" offset="4623130">The three-judge court was contrary to legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.672" offset="4634102">The Federal Act without stating what legislative history they had mind and cited principally the decision of Woolfolk against Brown in the Federal District Court in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.967" offset="4671195">We submit that the Woolfolk case is distinguishable from this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.240" offset="4688332">In that particular case, the recipients involved lived in a WIN district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.753" offset="4714350">They had not been specifically determined to be inappropriate for WIN referral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.555" offset="4733576">The District Court in that case said that that you could not refer under state program, persons who are inappropriate for referral to WIN.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.529" offset="4769520">However, in that case, reading a language of the decision of District Court in that case, they said that determination as to who is appropriate for referral or inappropriate of referral based on the remoteness was he made on individual cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.851" offset="4834826">And they also said that which he interpreted that saying that, that it must apply only where -- only in districts where there was a WIN program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.901" offset="4862934">In other words, that in state districts were the welfare districts where there is no WIN program, the Woolfolk case does not even apply on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.050" offset="4891564">And secondly, that to the extent that a state program parallels and refers to the WIN program and takes into consideration those people who have been determined to be inappropriate for referral to WIN although they can be referred under the state program under state jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.129" offset="4963871">We submit that, to that extent the District Court in Woolfolk was incorrect in its interpretation of the statute -- of the requirements of the statute, the supremacy situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.645" offset="5005981">Now, we point out to the Court that only in the Woolfolk case and those cases which cited the District Court in Woolfolk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.465" offset="5033253">All of these cases arising before this Court affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.029" offset="5051538">That was the only cases in which the court has ever held a state parallel work requirement to be invalid under the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.932" offset="5087065">And there are some 20 or 21 States which have developed parallel state work requirements at the same time the federal system has been developing its work requirements under the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.827" offset="5138683">All of these state programs have developed a parallel and along the same time as the -- that the Federal Government was getting into the act of work requirements.</text>
