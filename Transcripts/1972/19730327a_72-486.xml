            <text syncTime="31.366" offset="228812">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.695" offset="242186">These consolidated cases are here in writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals to the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.352" offset="272802">The basic question presented is whether the Federal Power Commission is barred by Section 441 of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 from permitting a company subject to its jurisdiction to seize flowing through to the company’s customers in the form of lower rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.599" offset="357752">The benefits derived from the use of accelerated depreciation on certain property.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.633" offset="381889">If the Tax Reform Act is not by such action, the question arises whether the Commission’s action in this case was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.313" offset="420655">Before I discuss the facts of this case, some introduction is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.850" offset="442807">It has wrong been established that Federal Income Taxes are includable as an expense under the cost of service method used by the Federal Power Commission in ratemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.107" offset="483767">Accelerated tax depreciation was first authorized by in 1954 with the adoption of Section 167 of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.565" offset="529638">Under accelerated tax depreciation, deductions for a particular asset are relatively high in its early years and relatively low in its later years compared to what they would have been had straight-line tax depreciation been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.037" offset="587525">When the matter first came before the Commission in a ratemaking context, the Commission determined that the use of accelerated tax depreciation simply resulted in a tax deferral.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.138" offset="639875">Accordingly, the Commission decided that for ratemaking purposes a company’s taxes should be normalized, that --</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="140.473" offset="665266">When you say the matter first came, you’re talking historically not about this particular proceeding?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_huntington" startTime="144.789" stopTime="337.887">
            <label>Mr. Samuel Huntington</label>
            <text syncTime="144.789" offset="682506">That’s right, historically; it back was in 1956 or so.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.871" offset="710823">The Commission decided that the -- for ratemaking purposes, the tax should be normalized and by normalized, it means that they should be calculated as if the company had used straight-line tax depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.429" offset="769128">The difference between the taxes actually paid and the higher normalized taxes claimed as cost of service was required to be placed in a special tax reserve account for the payment of future taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.668" offset="826075">Several years later, the Commission in the Alabama-Tennessee case reconsidered the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.859" offset="850840">It concluded there that the use of accelerated tax depreciation resulted in a permanent tax savings.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.960" offset="879261">This conclusion was squarely based on the Commission’s finding that the natural gas industry would continue to expand rapidly for the foreseeable future, an assumption which is certainly not true today.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.233" offset="936312">The Commission noted that when an expanding company uses accelerated tax depreciation sufficient tax depreciation deductions on new property are available to all set declining tax depreciation deductions on all property.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.784" offset="998484">The Commission does ordered natural gas companies using accelerated depreciation for tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.024" offset="1023457">To also use accelerated tax depreciation for ratemaking purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.062" offset="1043623">In this way, the benefits of accelerated tax depreciation would be flowed through to the company’s customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.072" offset="1079672">It’s important to note that both the Commission’s normalization order and its flow-through order were upheld by various Courts of Appeals as being within the Commission’s discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.851" offset="1130768">Other regulatory agencies are sharply divided on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.821" offset="1150621">In short, the matter is in technical one turns in large part on an analysis of particular facts pertaining to give an industry and is precisely the type of question which falls within the broad discretion that regulatory agencies have over ratemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.191" offset="1216136">This brings us to Section 441 of the Tax Reform Act of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.186" offset="1244139">As the legislative history of the Act makes clear, Congress was concerned with the lost of revenues to the Government resulting from the use of accelerated tax depreciation by public utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.126" offset="1295862">Rather than prohibit the use of accelerated tax depreciation all together, Congress chose simply to bar future shifts to faster methods of depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.732" offset="1346330">With respect to existing or pre-1970 property, the statute permits the use of one straight-line tax depreciation, two, accelerated depreciation with normalization if the utility had been using accelerated depreciation when the Act was passed; and three, accelerated depreciation with “flow-through” if the company had been using “flow-through” when the Act was passed.</text>

            <text syncTime="404.795" offset="1722598">Now, similar rules apply to new or post 1969 property, but with respect to new property which expands a company’s capacity, an additional rule was adopted. Under Section 167 (l) (4) (a) of the code regulated companies on “flow-through” were given the right to elect not to have “flow-through” apply to their expansion of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.854" offset="1834820">As the legislative history of the statute indicates the effect of this provision is to permit companies in making the election to use straight-line tax depreciation without having to obtain the approval of the regulatory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.183" offset="1896155">In an order upheld by the court below and not an issue here, the Federal Power Commission announced as a general policy, it would permit companies making the election to use normalization on their expansion property.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.227" offset="1952266">I come now to this case after the Tax Reform Act was enacted, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation, the petitioner here indicated to the Commission in a pending rate proceeding that it would make the election not to use “flow-through” on its expansion property.</text>

          <turn speaker="samuel_huntington" startTime="486.784" stopTime="869.390">
            <label>Mr. Samuel Huntington</label>
            <text syncTime="486.784" offset="2050487">Well, it said that it would use -- it sought permission to use normalization on the expansion property as well as on its existing property.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.879" offset="2082879">It said that if the Commission did not give a permission to use normalization, it would straight-line depreciation on its expansion property.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.518" offset="2125406">The Commission granted the Commission both to with respect to expansion property and existing property.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.241" offset="2156335">The Commission found that once Texas Gas had switch to normalization on its expansion property, tax depreciation on that property would no longer be available to offset declining tax depreciation on existing and replacement property.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.612" offset="2221850">The reason it would no longer be available, is that under normalization benefits from the use of accelerated depreciation on expansion property are placed in a deferred tax reserve account and may only be use to pay future taxes on the expansion property.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.828" offset="2294680">The deferred tax reserve is the very essence of normalization and its part of the statutory definition of normalization in the Tax Reform Act, that Section 167 (l) (3) (g), the definition section of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.295" offset="2364583">With expansion property out of the picture, the Commission concluded that the use of accelerated tax depreciation on existing and replacement property would no longer resolve in a permanent tax savings.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.659" offset="2422053">Under these circumstances, the Commission held that the use of normalization on all of the property of Texas Gas would lead to more stable tax cost for ratemaking purpose and it would in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.030" offset="2475447">The Court of Appeals did not reach the ultimate merits of the Commission’s order but held that Section 441 of the Tax Reform Act foreclose the Commission from permitting switches from flow-through to normalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.821" offset="2542634">It is to that issue, I will now turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.565" offset="2569592">There is nothing on the face Section 441 which suggests that regulatory agencies may not permit shifts from flow-through to normalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.838" offset="2610761">As I have noted, the statute merely lists the permissible methods of tax depreciation in such a way as to bar shifts from slower to faster methods of depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.492" offset="2657364">Under the literal terms of the stature, companies on “flow-through” qualify for all three methods of depreciation that a straight-line depreciation accelerated, depreciation with normalization and accelerated depreciation with flow-through.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.808" offset="2722565">The election provision simply gives a company the right to elect not to use “flow-through” on expansion property.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.835" offset="2762689">The legislative history of the statute confirms that the statute does not bar ships from “flow-through” to normalization with appropriate regulatory agency approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.393" offset="2804903">The House Report on the initial version which did not include the election provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.381" offset="2828936">The House Report describes the effect of the bill in three general rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.821" offset="2854640">The House Report describes these three general rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.274" offset="2864462">The third rule in the House Report is that if “flow-through” is being use, the tax payer must continue to use “flow-through” unless the appropriate regulatory agency permits a change as to that property.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.823" offset="2954637">Respondents argue vigorously that this third general rule refer to in the House Report was displaced by the election provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.219" offset="2988283">The election provision was first added by the Senate to apply to all property and later restricted in conference to apply only to expansion property.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.103" offset="3031751">It is our submission that the election provision does not affect a regulatory agency’s authority to permit companies to abandon “flow-through.”</text>
            <text syncTime="740.705" offset="3066232">All the election provision does is to give utilities the absolute right without having to go to the agency first to get off “flow-through.”</text>
            <text syncTime="752.588" offset="3113775">This was not provided in the House Bill, the only way agency could get of “flow-through” under the House Bill was to get the regulatory agency’s approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.045" offset="3159542">Now, we have quoted the relevant excerpts of the Senate Report and the Conference Report in our brief at pages 23 to 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.012" offset="3203427">And that we submit that a reading of those reports clearly supports our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.141" offset="3223907">In fact, respondents studiously avoid a direct confrontation with the pertinent provisions of these two reports, which we submit are very pertinent indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.232" offset="3280332">Respondents also vigorously argue that certain language in the House and Senate reports to the effect that the legislation would freeze existing depreciation practices supports their construction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.594" offset="3333726">The House Report for example noted that requirement that all for the later companies revert immediately to straight-line depreciation would place some regulated companies that a competitive disadvantage would result in wide spread rate increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.418" offset="3393076">Accordingly, the House Committee had determined “in general to freeze the current situation regarding methods of depreciation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="832.724" offset="3434245">The short answer to respondent’s contention on this freeze language is that the freeze language appeared first in the House Report and was largely copied by the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.621" offset="3481893">But the House Bill as everyone acknowledges had three general rules, so the “freeze” was obviously subject to the three general rules and as I have noted the third rule explicitly acknowledges that the legislation permits the abandonment of “flow-through” with the approval of the appropriate regulatory authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="1537.302" offset="6252544">May it please -- Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.877" offset="6270830">I agree with the -- with counsel for the Government, Mr. Huntington that the issues in this case arise primarily under the Tax Reform Act of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.323" offset="6328613">The question that the Court of -- the Commission has found that that Act required one result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.879" offset="6362885">The Court of Appeals has found that the Act required another result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.531" offset="6377514">Really, the question in this case is which of those two results is in conformity with the purpose and intent of Congress in enacting the Tax Reform Act of 1969?</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.365" offset="6420877">Specifically, was it the intent and purpose of Congress in enacting that Act to bring about a drastic and immediate change in the depreciation practices of most of the utilities in this country?</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.716" offset="6478242">A change which would result in prompt, substantial, widespread rate increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.109" offset="6511783">The Court of Appeals, the result reached by the Court of Appeals is that this was not the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.579" offset="6541667">The result of the Court of Appeals allows the utilities to take normalize depreciation with respect to their expansion property, but it leaves the rest of the property exactly the way it was before with the same tax practices in effect as before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.417" offset="6621080">This is precisely what Congress intended, you can see that from that phase of the act and even more clearly it appears in the legislative history of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.895" offset="6654934">First, the Act itself specifically provides as counsel has pointed out for the election with respect to post 1969 expansion property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.401" offset="6692968">But let me pause right here to point out that the Act very narrowly defines post 1969 expansion property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.393" offset="6732988">It is only that property acquired after 1969, which does not replace existing property and which increases the operating of productive capacity of the utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.348" offset="6792756">Now, in the case of the pipeline industry, that means that this expansion property starting at flat zero in 1970 will grow and because of the gas shortage which is mentioned by counsel, this expansion property will probably grow very slowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.516" offset="6861406">So, the election with respect to expansion property will have very little practical tax effect or rate effect for a long time in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.062" offset="6903620">If that’s what’s been lax on by the Commission, it’s a very stubby tail to wag a very large dog.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.802" offset="6938624">The Tax Act also expressly provides for the retention of “flow-through” depreciation with respect to property to companies that have been using it on the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.338" offset="6988675">It twice with respect of pre-1969 and with respect -- I mean pre-1970 and post 1969 properties specially provides the companies that have been “flowing through” may continue to “flow-through.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.237" offset="7044368">The Court of Appeals reached exactly the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.898" offset="7062967">Now, the legislative history makes it clear that this was all that Congress intended to do, this and nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.553" offset="7101628">I think I'm agreeing with my brothers on the other side concerning the reason for the passage of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.617" offset="7133811">The Utility Commissions over the country have been trending toward “flow-through” requiring their utilities to go to “flow-through” because this was the way that you minimize utility rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.992" offset="7179368">You made the companies pay -- charge their rates on the same basis that they paid their taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.799" offset="7202565">You didn’t give them any fictitious tax in there like normalization does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.421" offset="7225031">The only thing wrong with this from the treasury’s point of view was that as Mr. Huntington said, it also reduces the taxes paid by the companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.800" offset="7266617">And the Committee had found that it would soon result in loss of a billion dollars-and-a-half to maybe $2 billion to the Federal Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.402" offset="7300995">What to about that loss?</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.636" offset="7309876">The solution is proposed to the House was to freeze current tax situation -- current depreciation practices right where they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.759" offset="7346448">The trend to us toward “flow-through”, freeze it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.803" offset="7358568">Stop it right there, and that was all they proposed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.015" offset="7375391">They did not propose to reverse the river but just to freeze it right where it was.</text>

            <text syncTime="2128.373" offset="8616835">But you see in the course of the legislation, the passage of the legislation through Congress, first, Chairman White of the Commission came up to Congress and said, we’d like to have it everything just put on straight-line depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.625" offset="8677857">The Congress turned down that request for the reason that in addition that the one mentioned by Mr. Boland for the reason that to put everybody on straight-line would result in prompt substantial widespread utility rate increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.591" offset="8741700">And Congress did not want prompt rate increases to come into effect and so they turned him down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.347" offset="8768763">Now, Mr. Justice White, if the Commission should win this case under the Commission’s decision in this case we reached almost exactly the same situation that we would have reach under Chairman White’s suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.231" offset="8828322">The utilities would charge their rates on the basis of straight-line depreciation, but pay their taxes on the basis of accelerated depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.523" offset="8861445">And for right purposes, you would in a fact have straight-line depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.054" offset="8887568">It’s not quite the same but it’s almost the same and this is what Chairman White suggested and this is what they turned down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.212" offset="8912227">Now, when they did that, they thought that they had accomplished their purpose without putting any rate -- in any law into effect which would cause rate increases in the utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.456" offset="8961233">They said that the Bill would forestall the revenue loss which the continuation of existing trends would make almost inevitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.589" offset="9001775">And that it would do so “in a way which with very few exceptions will require no increase in utility rates because of the tax laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="2245.144" offset="9083904">Your Honor, I believe that it was the intent of Congress to accomplish the “freeze” and to accomplish it in such a way as to avoid rate increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.112" offset="9119848">I believe that the action of the Commission not only “unfreezes” but it drastically revolutionizes utility practices and does so in a way which causes rate increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.754" offset="9170422">In other words, the result reached by the Commission is precisely the opposite of the result which Congress saw.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.636" offset="9201873">Now, let me point this out, when the Bill got into the Senate, someone in the Senate suggested, let’s give the pipelines or the utility the power or election to change to away from -- to abolish “flow-through” depreciation with respect to all the properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.022" offset="9283480">Abolish “flow-through” with respect to all the properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.311" offset="9296645">Now, if that had happened, you would have almost exactly the same situation that you have under the Act as it was passed -- I mean under the Act that was construed by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.189" offset="9340113">The Commission says, this little -- the election with respect to expansion property puts us in a position where for all practical purposes we got to allow the pipeline to go on and normalizes to all its properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.093" offset="9423705">We have no alternative, that’s the Commission’s position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.116" offset="9443871">We are force into it by the practicalities of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.401" offset="9456933">So what the Commission is saying that an election with respect to the expansion properties is tantamount for all practical purposes to an election with respect to all properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.061" offset="9507610">This is precisely what the Senate proposed to put in the Act and which the Congress turned down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.147" offset="9531956">So, twice this matter was considered, twice the Congress turned it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.599" offset="9557765">The Commission has now reached the very result which Congress turned down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.303" offset="9584619">Let me address myself to the reason why I think that the Commission does not have the discretion to do what it did.</text>

            <text syncTime="2390.109" offset="9663822">Let’s talk about in terms of the Commission’s power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.829" offset="9682735">The Commission is under the duty as the court below said that to allow a tax cost in the cost of service which is no greater than actual taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.438" offset="9729128">The Court says this, there’s nothing in the Tax Reform Act of 1969 which modifies the Commission’s duty under the Natural Gas Act to require regulated Utilities Companies such as Texas Gas to set rates which reflect actually expenditures with respect to such property -- the set rates which reflect actual expenditure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.583" offset="9805720">Now, the Commission does not have discretion then to grant a utility, a tax allowance and its cost of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.384" offset="9840933">It doesn’t have power to grant a utility and allowance and its cost of service for taxes which are not paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.521" offset="9873429">In other words, it does not have the power to treat as a cost something which in fact is not a cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="2454.273" offset="9920449">That is the law under the Natural Gas Act as the Court of Appeals held and as this Court held in United U.S. Pipeline versus FPC, which was a tax case and which Mr. Justice White is familiar with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.957" offset="9975202">In that case, the Court said that the Commission have the power and the duty to limit the cost of service to real expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.261" offset="10008430">Now, in this case, Texas Gas is normalization on its little tag of expansion property is not going to increase its depreciation, not under decrease it’s the depreciation by one dime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.454" offset="10065168">Now or ever, it’s not going to increase its income taxes with respect to depreciation by one dime now or ever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.593" offset="10097768">The only effect that it will have or to be put more money in Texas Gas’ pockets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.250" offset="10120338">Texas Gas gets to charge a higher rate because of normalization with respect to this little piece of expansion property and it gets to pocket the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.344" offset="10160776">And the Commission is in the position of saying that because Texas Gas gets increase revenues due -- with respect to its expansion property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.935" offset="10199124">Therefore, in order to keep it even, in order to keep it whole it’s got to get increase revenues on a large scale with respect to its $600 million worth of depreciable rate base.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.262" offset="10248443">There is no increase in Texas Gas’ taxes as a result of it’s going to normalize depreciation on its expansion property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.500" offset="10293373">Therefore, we say that the Commission had no power to give it an additional return or an additional amount in its cost of service to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.490" offset="10357321">We say that if we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.271" offset="10364426">That if you do, you have accomplished precisely what Congress was attempting to avoid. Congress said, let’s freeze the situation and avoid tax rate increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.917" offset="10407058">The effect of the Commission’s decision is to unfreeze the situation and drastically change tax practices and do so at the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars of utility rate increases throughout the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2613.488" offset="10557315">The whole concept of normalized depreciation is that it works when the company is in an expanding condition or its depreciable base is at least stable, then the principle flow-through depreciation where your new properties coming in all set your old properties which are declining in value, that principle works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.050" offset="10675597">It would not work with the pipeline which because of the gas shortage or whatever was winding down its activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.810" offset="10706631">And therefore, if a corporate -- if the tax utility or particular a pipeline were caught in the winding down condition where its depreciable property was actually decreasing, then this would not be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.641" offset="10757935">But let me point out that there is not one shred of evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.572" offset="10777684">Not a shred of evidence that Texas Gas’ property is going to be -- is going to wind down or decrease.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.979" offset="10803284">As a matter of fact there is the question of normalization was never even considered in the trial of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.540" offset="10829511">Texas Gas didn’t ask for it when it filed its return, nobody put in any evidence on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2770.669" offset="11186030">There are two issues in this case and they would put into this case by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.962" offset="11203271">First issue was whether the Court of Appeals was correct in construing the Tax Act as precluding the Commission from considering the request by Texas Gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.709" offset="11246216">And the second issue is whether assuming the Commission as authority -- continuing authority to consider the question whether it considered it problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="2796.399" offset="11288952">They’ve been put into this case by the United States and they have been accepted us.</text>

            <text syncTime="2875.447" offset="11605138">Now the United States hasn’t said very much about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.563" offset="11621648">They would like you to believe that discretion is the end of the argument that because an agency obviously has great deal of discretion in general to decide what the parameters of its ratemaking principles are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.708" offset="11698239">But if they decide for “flow-through” that that’s all what has to be you have to worry about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.755" offset="11722376">But if there is one thing in this complex tax law, which is clear, if an agency chooses to fix the rights of a utility on the conventional cost of service basis it may include a tax allowance but that tax allowance is to be -- to the extent, it is possible to calculate it the actual taxes paid and not theoretical tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.789" offset="11850480">And when the Federal Power Commission and other agencies happen time to time attempted to include in the right of the company fictitious tax allowances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.863" offset="11902830">They have been regularly smacked down by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.483" offset="11921324">The problem with respect to liberalize depreciation is whether it’s used involves a tax deferral or a tax saving.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.011" offset="11967404">If it involves a tax deferral, then the actual taxes are not what to you pay in the particular year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.665" offset="12018082">The tax incurred is a higher amount although you are allowed to defer a part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.305" offset="12036577">And under such circumstances it would be appropriate to allow the normalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.601" offset="12069804">But the fact of a matter is that you do not pay taxes on the basis of the situation with respect to individual pieces of property or individual groups or property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.116" offset="12135842">You pay taxes on the entire tax obligation of the regulated utility and from the depreciation standpoint under the depreciation status of the entire utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.075" offset="12187669">And this is what the Commission found in the Alabama-Tennessee case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.088" offset="12203760">It means that with respect to growing or stable company, the lower taxes on the later on later vintages of property will be more than sufficient to counteract the higher taxes on earlier advantages of property with the result that you will have a constantly growing tax surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.318" offset="12312639">Now, that’s what happened to Texas Gas, when it was allowed to normalize prior to 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.670" offset="12342000">As a result, it comes in to this case with $13 million of reserve which nobody can claim is related to the all of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.130" offset="12395917">It will as a result of the right given it by Congress the special right given it by Congress by Section 441 be entitle to accrue additional reserves which are in fact interest free loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.612" offset="12473866">And with respect to new expansion property, but the fact that is accruing additional interest free reserve has nothing whatsoever to do with whether or not Texas Gas use of liberalize depreciation on all property and new property, which is what’s being doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.475" offset="12565295">We’ll seize to be a tax saving, it was using liberalize depreciation on all its property and because it was a growing company it resulted in tax savings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.344" offset="12620779">It will use liberalize depreciation in the future on all its property and if it is a growing and stable country -- company, it will still be a tax saving.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.096" offset="12671770">Now, what about this gas supply shortage and everything like that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.396" offset="12696952">There are areas for commission expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.449" offset="12721194">One area for commission expertise could be a finding based on evidence, substantial evidence but certainly one you some weight to, saying that the industry has changed and this company or other companies are not going to be growing companies?</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.428" offset="12797053">And therefore, the factual situation is change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.002" offset="12811368">If that was the posture in which this came to, then you obviously unless the Commission’s determination was clearly not based on the record would have a very difficult problem if you want to reverse it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.257" offset="12864449">But that is not the problem the way this case comes to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.291" offset="12884511">On the contrary, the Commission assumed, they more than assumed, they found an Order 578 that Texas Gas was going to continue to grow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.900" offset="12946996">And I am citing from page 110 of the record about two lines, three lines below, the numeral 27, 47.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.714" offset="12998196">And here’s what say, said the Commission this isn’t me, “While Texas Gas is pre-1970 properties may represent a declining net investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.124" offset="13039888">The company will undoubtedly be adding its entire rate base by not post-1969 construction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.312" offset="13080639">They didn’t find that gas supply shortage or any thing else had changed the situation which met this was a tax savings rather tax deferral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.903" offset="13134973">What they found was that because the Commission now has the right -- pardon me, because Texas Gas now has the right to keep a portion of the tax savings i.e. the increasing amount of their new expansion property that that somehow converted the situation from a tax saving to a tax deferral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.040" offset="13251584">But we submit to you that there is nothing in the Act, nothing in the Commission’s rule and nothing in common sense which says, that because a company has the temporary use of an interest free loan that means that it’s use of liberalize depreciation is going to become a tax deferral rather than a tax saving.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.671" offset="13366105">It only means that if at some unforeseen, an unexpected and certainly not found on this record future date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.885" offset="13398915">There were some need for use of this fine and over and beyond that the $13 million they already have for use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.692" offset="13434128">If only millions that there are be additional ways of meeting this possible but not found future contingency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.836" offset="13470699">So, our basic position in this case assuming that the court below was wrong in saying that the Commission was precluded from considering this request is that its resolution of the matter was in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.079" offset="13559724">And if you will read the Commission’s decision, you will find that it’s so reasonably for finding there is no tax saving is this assumption that because all of the facts savings will be put into this fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.018" offset="13627434">They are not available and have to be available in the first place and in the second place if there was necessary, they could be made available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.546" offset="13657527">And the only I think I’d like to say is Mr. Huntington says that normalization has to be put into a reserve fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.917" offset="13691068">We will grant that although the House Report suggests that isn’t true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.232" offset="13708309">But, there is nothing in the -- there aren’t anything else that says, what it goes into a fund it can’t be use for future use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.051" offset="13739551">That’s what deferred taxes are for.</text>

            <text syncTime="3427.490" offset="13813321">When Mr. Morrow conceded that there maybe certain circumstances under which the Commission could permit and abandonment of “flow-through” with respect to existing property, I think he conceded this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.383" offset="13864939">That is precisely our position and it’s a matter of Commission discretion that this is what the third rule in the House provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.085" offset="13899734">It left this type of thing up to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.658" offset="13918020">The only thing the election provision here was to give the companies an absolute right without getting regulatory agency approval to get off “flow-through.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.397" offset="13969011">Now, the language in the Senate Report is pertinent because it was the Senate that added the election provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.654" offset="13997955">And the language in the report shows that in adding it, it did not mean to displace the third rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3509.711" offset="14142255">But it is we do come to grips with that issue rather squarely in our brief and we think there’s just a total misreading of the Conference Report and that we must rely on the Senate Report and that in merely narrowing the election from existing property to expansion property that conference certainly did not mean to negate the general rule referred to in to a House and the Senate Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.967" offset="14243192">I’d like to now to turn to the -- assuming that the Commission has the power, was it properly exercised in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.833" offset="14278719">Now, both respondents here and in their briefs talk about the actual taxes doctrine while the actual taxes doctrine has never been thought or never been held to preclude the Commission from exercising its discrimination in how to treat liberalized tax depreciation for ratemaking purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.162" offset="14363982">It is largely a question of whether the taxes result in a -- whether the use of liberalize depreciation results in a tax deferral or a tax savings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.309" offset="14412570">Now, if we could consider all of Texas Gas property together, then we would have a different case than we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.372" offset="14456874">Then you would continue assuming that Texas Gas continued to expand, you would have -- you would have -- you would be able to use the benefits from the expansion property with respect to the old property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.730" offset="14506297">But Congress made the segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.954" offset="14519150">Congress said, “With respect to expansion property, you can get off “flow-through”, you can go to straight-line and if you can get the agencies approval, you can go to normalization.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.334" offset="14560737">So, Congress segregated these types of properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.336" offset="14572753">So you cannot consider the tax benefits from the expansion property in determining what method of accounting to apply to the existing property for ratemaking purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.276" offset="14632521">The whole concept of normalization is that you take the benefits and you put them into a reserve account. They are not available for anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.862" offset="14678810">They are in that account so that you can pay future taxes with respect to that property.</text>
