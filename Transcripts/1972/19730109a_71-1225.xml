            <text syncTime="43.132" offset="275937">This case commenced actually on July 9, 1965 when Gerald Scarpelli was convicted in Wisconsin of armed robbery in the same county and was placed on probation for a period of seven years in the custody of what was then the State Department of Public Welfare which has control of all probationers and parolees in the State of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.167" offset="404041">He was also at the same time sentenced to a term of 15 years in the Wisconsin State Prison and that execution of the sentence was stayed pending the seven years probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.046" offset="463600">He was permitted to leave the State of Wisconsin pursuant to the interstate compact for out of state parolee supervision and go to the state of Illinois where he resided.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.385" offset="512920">His residence was in a suburb of Chicago and he was employed in another suburb of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.822" offset="562657">He was accepted for supervision by the Cook County Probation Department pursuant to the interstate compact on August 5th, 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.383" offset="624933">And on Friday August 6th, the following day, a home in Deerfield, Illinois which is a northern suburb of Chicago and is quite some distance North from Scarpelli’s residence and from his place of employment was burglarized during the day time in the morning and news of this came to the Department of Public Welfare which saw a news article in the Chicago tribune which contained two photographs including one of our probationer Scarpelli and also a statement which he gave to the Assistant State’s Attorney of Lake County, Illinois in which he made a full confession of his part in the burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.142" offset="887933">The co-defendant or the other burglar was also his co-defendant in the Wisconsin robbery of which he had been previously convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.147" offset="959927">I think Fred Kleckner, the other robber, the other burglar in Illinois was not at that time convicted in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.044" offset="1015515">Kleckner was shot leaving the burglar premises and Scarpelli however escaped and was not taken in the custody for some little time.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="243.758" offset="1078418">Are you describing that the conduct which led to the revocation?</text>

            <label>Mr. William A. Platz</label>
            <text syncTime="248.478" offset="1097331">That is what I’m describing now, the conduct which led to the revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.807" offset="1114572">Now, at that time in Wisconsin, the law was that there was no right to a hearing on revocation of probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.623" offset="1157831">Our law on probation was enacted in 1909, two years after our Parole Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.204" offset="1188237">The parole law had placed parolees in the custody of the old Board of Control which later became the Department of Public Welfare and two years later in 1909, the legislature enacted the Probation Law under which the courts could either impose sentence and stay execution thereof and place them on probation under the custody and control of the same department which had control of parolees and under the same rules and regulations or could withhold sentence all together and place them on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.316" offset="1352600">In the case of Scarpelli, it was the case of the sentence being imposed and execution staid.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.083" offset="1379662">Now, originally in Wisconsin, the probation law required that before probation be revoked, there be a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.541" offset="1437550">The law said a personal hearing, a full investigation and personal hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.772" offset="1458448">In 1947, that provision was removed in the course of the revision of the statute and there had been no hearing since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.999" offset="1515395">This Court in Escoe v. Zerbst did held that there was no constitutional right to a hearing on revocation or probation.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="361.015" offset="1547473">There had been no hearing since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.252" offset="1552384">I suppose there have been perhaps hearings since Morrissey against Brewer, aren’t there?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_a_platz" startTime="365.726" stopTime="491.052">
            <label>Mr. William A. Platz</label>
            <text syncTime="365.726" offset="1566281">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.867" offset="1570879">And since before that too but what I mean is up until the time of this case, there had been no action.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.204" offset="1600240">Now, this case was commenced in the Federal Court in December of 1968 which was over three years after the revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.171" offset="1660008">And it took quite a while it was 1970 before it was decided in the Court, in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.001" offset="1699401">We lost in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.826" offset="1706715">We appealed of the Circuit Court of Appeals and we lost there it took about almost a year for that to be decided and we applied for certiorari in this Court which was granted at the end of June.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.588" offset="1769723">Counsel now takes the position that the case has become moot because the original seven years of probation, counter years has expired, I have filed a reply a brief and answering this claim of mootness and in order to have more time to discuss the merits, I really preferred to leave the mootness to my reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.592" offset="1865749">I consider that the case is not moot, that we have a right, if we have committed constitutionally, we have a right to correct it and to correct it now even though the original seven counter years have expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.766" offset="1934399">Actually at the time this matter was before the Court of Appeals, the probationer Scarpelli had been released on parole to meet a federal charge and had already been tried federally and was then in (Inaudible) in the federal institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.207" offset="2024155">And he, thereafter, was released on parole from the federal institution and I’m not sure I know just where he is now but we have a string on him and can get him back for --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="491.052" offset="2067623">I take it, the essence of your mootness argument is that since the sentence has six or seven years yet to run, he may have his parole revoked again and be back in.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_a_platz" startTime="505.071" stopTime="758.851">
            <label>Mr. William A. Platz</label>
            <text syncTime="505.071" offset="2123630">On the basis of the role which this Court has laid down whereby the states have the right to correct their errors in case.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.955" offset="2191235">And on federal habeas corpus, of course, the rule is that the Court makes such order as long justice require and it does not require that there’d be an absolute discharge of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.984" offset="2263333">Now, at that time as I say, this man was rather summarily revoked on the strength of what he had done and his admission. On the record, there is no question that he made the admissions to the State’s Attorney’s Office in the County of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.936" offset="2359150">In his traverse, he admits, he made the admissions to the attorney to the Assistant States Attorney but he takes the position that he did so on the basis of some statements having been made to him that of course, the Wisconsin authorities would never be informed of this and that Kleckner had been killed escaping from the burglary and that no one would be hurt if he were to admit his part and that he’d be let out on low bail and all of that which -- But he does not, in any way, denied that he made the statement, the complete statement is set forth in the appendix in this case and you already will see that it contains plenty of corroborate of detail from which the department would have a right believe that it was true and correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.169" offset="2604074">However, the question before the District Court was whether he was entitled to a hearing and if so, whether he was entitled to be represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.392" offset="2660916">And at that time we asked for a certiorari, we intended to raise both positions here.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.909" offset="2687039">However, the Morrissey case as effectively defeated us so far as the right to the hearing itself is concerned because I cannot distinguish Morrissey from this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.541" offset="2749524">Although Morrissey involved parole and this one involves probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.255" offset="2768436">Nevertheless, the two are in law indistinguishable because our probationers are handled exactly the same as parolees.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.018" offset="2811486">There is one slight exception but nothing that would make a legal distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.796" offset="2850565">So, I’m here now only on the question of the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.733" offset="2878255">However, I would ask this Court if you can do so to clear up one thing for us.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.539" offset="2921514">Now, as I mentioned in this case, this man was permitted to go to Illinois under the interstate compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.403" offset="2952965">We have over 600 people, Wisconsin people are being supervised in other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.902" offset="2987029">Nationwide, there are at least 25,000 people who are being supervised parolees and probationers being supervised in other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.255" offset="3028407">It is very difficult for us to see how we can apply strictly the Morrissey rules to these out of state supervised cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.675" offset="3082115">In the first place, the preliminary hearing which is mandated by Morrissey is going to be rather difficult to --</text>

            <text syncTime="781.393" offset="3228923">I suggest, Your Honor, that the Morrissey rule has created us special problems with reference to those cases and of course to any case where the probationer or parolee has absconded and where his violations have occurred outside of the State in which he was on probation or parole.</text>

            <text syncTime="3029.791" offset="12222568">Indeed, many confess revocation proceedings, the conduct charged actually constitutes the commission of a criminal act.</text>
