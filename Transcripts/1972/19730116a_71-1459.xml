            <label>Mr. Austin W. Lewis</label>
            <text syncTime="6.032" offset="127457">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.428" offset="141040">With the Court’s indulgence and although it will require some repetition, I would like to devote my remaining time here today to a step-by-step analysis of the four legal concepts that I consider are applicable in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.129" offset="227871">Hoping that this will place this unique civil right -- civil law problem in proper perspective for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.449" offset="265174">Initially thought, I will say in the absence of additional questions from the Court, I will lay aside any further discussion of the point that state law should be applied here over in a federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.120" offset="315852">I believe this is fully covered in the briefs and consider that the Leiter Minerals’ opinion of this Court as well as the other cases cited in the respondent’s brief removes us as a serious issue in the case and while certainly no concessions have been made by the Solicitor General, I had a feeling from the Government’s reply brief and the argument made yesterday that this does not -- will not disturb the Government too seriously.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.561" offset="433612">Now, the four items to be considered in my opinion are these: First, a brief discussion of the legal status of mineral servitude in the State of Louisiana; second, a consideration of the three types of mineral servitudes that exist in that State; then third, the legal status of a case of contractual prescription, which on question is involved in the present case; and fourth and finally, the precise nature of the so-called reversionary interests of the United States in a case of contractual prescription, and whether any of the constitutional questions raised by the Government are applicable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.786" offset="610513">Now, on the first point, I will not devote a great deal of time to the basic mineral servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.902" offset="634964">Its nature appeared to have been understood by the Court yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.659" offset="650010">Except, I would like to stress that in Louisiana, there can be no separate estate in minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.078" offset="679685">No matter what form, the deed or reservation is placed and what language is used, only a servitude or easement is created which expires in 10 years, if not exercise by drilling.</text>

            <text syncTime="188.956" offset="859199">That’s just one evidence that it is not, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.173" offset="872051">I think the consequence we are dealing with here is that it involves only a remedial right, the prescription of limitation of 10 years, and therefore, can be valid and modified by subsequent act of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.003" offset="927431">That is a precise following the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="223.134" offset="995871">I think that’s the key issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.661" offset="1009977">Now, I will say that this strict rule of no separate estate and no mineral estate separate from the fee has met the test of many ingenious offers -- efforts to overcome it.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.617" offset="1081866">Sales for 20 years, sales in perpetuity, probably the most interesting was to the sale purporting to transfer the fee title and the minerals to the land below a plain 500 feet below the surface.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.915" offset="1147068">Although they were attempting to get -- avail both the title and the minerals but of course there are those that are simply servitude in disguise.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="267.681" offset="1174131">Is this a characteristic of the civil law generally?</text>
            <text syncTime="271.132" offset="1187924">Well, there isn’t a civilian up here on the bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.207" offset="1196178">So, I ask these rather basic questions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="austin_w_lewis" startTime="275.639" stopTime="309.387">
            <label>Mr. Austin W. Lewis</label>
            <text syncTime="275.639" offset="1205896">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.941" offset="1207150">That is the concept that the fee cannot be divided into separate estates has cause the civil law in our Civil Code to evolve a system of charges and burdens upon the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.010" offset="1271411">In other words, the servitude takes the place of a separate mineral estate but the courts firmly hold that such a servitude does not give the owner any title to the minerals in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.473" offset="1317282">He simply possesses the right to go on the land and explore for and reduce those minerals to his possession.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="309.387" stopTime="311.788">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="309.387" offset="1340897">And this is true in France and other places with the civil law --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="austin_w_lewis" startTime="311.788" stopTime="896.213">
            <label>Mr. Austin W. Lewis</label>
            <text syncTime="311.788" offset="1350510">Yes, it is taken from the French law.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.313" offset="1364616">But now while this servitude cannot be expanded or converted into a separate estate, it can be modified by contract in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.442" offset="1421145">So as a result, we wind up in Louisiana with three types of servitudes and these, I might add, were painstakingly described by the Louisiana Supreme Court in the Leiter advisory opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.224" offset="1468270">Now, the first of these is a servitude for fix term of five, eight, ten years with no provisions whatever for extending that servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.028" offset="1511528">Now currently, this is a vested property right that the United States in this case would have a servitude that been on that category, because Act 315 could not have impaired that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.686" offset="1570147">The second is the ordinary statutory servitude previously discussed which expires in 10 years unless exercised by the drilling of a well and obtaining a production.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.427" offset="1617063">The third and the one that’s under consideration here is a servitude subject to contractual prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.473" offset="1645275">Now, there are two and only two requirements to establish such as a servitude: One is that when it is originally established, it must be of uncertain or indefinite duration; and second, it must provide for its conditional extinguishment in some way.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.327" offset="1712671">Now, adjacent to that that is the fact that the servitude in this case mentioned a period of 10 years does not in anyway to track from it being a case of contractual servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.818" offset="1750601">Actually the law of Louisiana does that and had the period not been mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.014" offset="1775470">We consider, if the Court pleases, that this category squarely fits the servitudes in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.670" offset="1822072">They provide that if they were not exercised by drilling they would expire in 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.533" offset="1845478">Of course, whether or not there would be drilling 10 years later, clearly it was uncertain and indefinite event.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.764" offset="1870451">It could not be foreseen at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.414" offset="1885080">And of course as I said, that’s simply a re-expression of Louisiana law, because the servitude could not last for more than 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.219" offset="1928234">And of course, it also clearly provided for its conditional extinguishment if a well is not drilled on or before the end of the 10-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.120" offset="1967835">Now the only the departure of these servitudes from the statutory type is the effect of the use of the servitude by the drilling of a well.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.418" offset="2009004">A well, not completed as a producer under these servitudes, would not extend the servitude for full period of 10 years as would be the case and statutory interpretation, by the contract it would only extend it for 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.646" offset="2065951">If they got production of course it would lasts as long as production lasts.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.377" offset="2084864">But we submit, if the Court pleases, this limitation has nothing whatever to do with the designation and the classification of the initial servitude as being one of contractual prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.655" offset="2133974">That depends entirely on the terms relating to the 10-year period and the method by which it could be extended or extinguished at the end of that 10-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.551" offset="2181622">I think if I may refer the Court to Pages 12 and 13 of the respondent’s brief, you will find quotations from the Supreme Court’s advisory opinion on Leiter that say that's better than I can say it.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.092" offset="2243688">For example, the last paragraph on Page 12 says this, “Most mineral servitudes are not established for a fix time.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.660" offset="2286007">A servitude of indefinite duration is extinguished only when it is not exercised for a period of 10 years, precisely our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.622" offset="2329893">Such a servitude, created by mineral reservation and the sale to the Government, would under Act 315 of 1940 be rendered imprescriptible and would never be lost by prescription provided it was in existence at the time the 1940 Act went into effect.”</text>
            <text syncTime="572.672" offset="2394049">Now, the second quote on Page 13, “Nevertheless contracting parties are at liberty to establish a contractual period of prescription for the conditional extinguishment of the servitude through non-use provided that the period is 10 years or less.”</text>
            <text syncTime="589.704" offset="2462177">Again, precisely our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.512" offset="2481403">Now, if the Court please, I feel also greatly (Inaudible) in our assertion that this is a case of contractual servitude by the decisions of the two courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.927" offset="2531035">In the District Court, a train Louisiana jurist said this of the servitudes, “Clearly these servitudes present cases of contractual prescription.”</text>
            <text syncTime="618.270" offset="2576488">In the Fifth Circuit with the panel containing one of our most distinguished Louisiana jurists, the Court quoted that language of approval and said, and of course as a result to that Act 315 makes imprescriptible this servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.148" offset="2635943">So, I think when these Louisiana juries reach as a conclusion without any problem whatever, it is for some benefit to our contention that we do have cases of contractual prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.693" offset="2694144">Now, we now turn to what the legal status of the case of contractual prescription is.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.704" offset="2726222">The Louisiana Supreme Court said squarely that it is identical with that of the statutory prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.887" offset="2754957">Therefore, the Court in that connection to Page 30 of our brief where this was said by the Court, speaking of Act 315 of 1940, “The Act grows no distinction between statutory and contractual prescription and as we view the matter from the history of the Act, and the objects, and purposes for which it was adopted, it is manifest that the legislature intended the Act to be applicable to prescription whether established by statute or by contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.406" offset="2868955">For prescription had not already accrued at the time that the Act became effective.”</text>
            <text syncTime="700.482" offset="2905318">Now, if the Court please, the repeated argument of the Government, it is over and above Act 315, because it has a contract seems to ask to beg the question entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.989" offset="2967280">The question is, “What did that contract do?”</text>
            <text syncTime="719.509" offset="2981386">And under the Supreme Court resolution to this thing, it clearly established the case of contractual prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.237" offset="3008345">The brief of the Government acknowledges that the law of contractual prescription was in existence when the servitudes were purchased.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.633" offset="3041886">The Government is bound to know the law, it was charged with knowing the law, and certainly it was aware of the rule that if a contractual prescription was established, then it could be modified either lengthened or shortened as prescription applicable to it by subsequent Legislative Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.688" offset="3126105">Now, this brings us to the final and decisive issue in the case in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.882" offset="3150869">With a clear case of contractual prescription bringing to vow the legal principles of applying to statutory prescription, what were the legal rights of United States with respect to its so-called reversionary interests when Act 315 of 1940 was adopted?</text>
            <text syncTime="780.556" offset="3225579">Again, the state law is crystal clear on his point.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.326" offset="3240626">Holding that since only a law prescription of limitation is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.811" offset="3258598">This law goes only to matters of remedy and does not form a part of the contract itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.550" offset="3285556">And that therefore, the period of prescription maybe shortened or lengthened without impairing the obligations of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.232" offset="3312306">This, of course, is because no vested rights were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.559" offset="3329651">In fact, we have a specific decision of our Louisiana Supreme Court cited on Page 35 of our brief where Act 315 was applied retrospectively to a reservation of mineral rights and a sale to the United States and was held to be constitutional under State Constitution. Now, the ground on all of this, if Your Honor please, is quite fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.240" offset="3420348">It simply is based on the recognition that mentioned by Mr. Justice Stewart yesterday that the reversionary interests is not a vested right at all, but it is merely an inchoate hope or expectancy based on the laws of prescription or limitation which could be changed for by legslative Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.707" offset="3506239">And I repeat again my statement yesterday, there is no resemblance whatever between this so-called reversionary interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.916" offset="3531003">It really should be called a hope or expectancy and the common law state in reversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.089" offset="3551692">There is simply no legal resemblance at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.921" offset="3567052">Now, this Court has also refute to recognize that for a statute of limitation are involved which exist when a contract is executed, do not form a part of that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.219" offset="3624208">And therefore, they may be modified or even abrogated with respect to a pre-existing contract of Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.773" offset="3654510">This case is cited on Page 32 of our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1013.885" offset="4158882">Now as I said, the Government now is offering to the Court its analysis to the law of Louisiana and that is found in the first complete paragraph on page 4 of the reply brief and it says this, “Consequently, once the conveyance is involved in the present case were consummated, the United States by virtue of its undisputed ownership of the surface rights in the land in question had a paramount interest in the minerals below the surface subject only to the limited servitude stipulated in the reservations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.697" offset="4318124">Now if the Court please, I’d like to lay aside beside with that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.661" offset="4342053">This quotation from the Supreme Court of Louisiana in the Leiter Minerals advisory opinion and I quote, “In this case, when property is conveyed and the mineral rights are reserved, the party reserving the minerals is vested with a real right, the right to go up on the land and produce the minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.454" offset="4425226">In such a case, the purchase of the land subject to this servitude does not acquire the mineral rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.672" offset="4458036">As to the minerals, all the purchaser has acquired is the expectancy or hope that the mineral servitude will be extinguished by the 10-year prescription of non-use, and will not be extended or continued by use beyond this period, for the minerals had been reserved, the purchase of the land pays nothing for them and has no vested right in them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.437" offset="4549151">Then quoting from a prior decision of the Supreme Court in Tennant versus Russell, the Court says this, “A right is vested when the right to enjoinment, present or prospective has become the property of some particular person or persons as a present interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.320" offset="4624697">The right must be absolute, complete, and unconditional independent of a contingency, and a mere expectancy of future benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.424" offset="4669106">Or a contingent interest in property does not constitute a vested right.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.407" offset="4697004">So we say, if the Court please, if this concept of the Louisiana law is accepted by this Court and applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.264" offset="4736397">We think that all of the constitutional issues raised by the United States contract, property, supremacy are dissolve in thin air because we are not dealing with any vested interest in this so-called reversionary interest of the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1190.813" offset="4866591">Now the reservation, if Your Honor please, is found on Page 180 of the Addendum of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.286" offset="4908492">There are two of them but they are identical with Mr. Reynolds’ notice yesterday and that starts off by simply making the normal reservation that would be involved in the statutory prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.912" offset="4951019">Reserving the right to drill for and to produce into lay pipe lines and do all the necessary incidental things which rights will remain enforced for a period 10 years from the date of vesting title in United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.768" offset="5006399">And as long thereafter as oil, gas, sulfur, or some other minerals produced in the land or so long thereafter as grantor shall conduct drilling or reworking operations thereon with no cessation of more than 60 consecutive days until production results.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.551" offset="5069615">If production results, of course it remains in effect indefinite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.329" offset="5088737">Now, this language, Your Honor, the paragraph I just read, is identical with the law of statutory prescription with the same exemption that I noted earlier, that the drilling operations must be conducted as 60-day intervals to maintain the servitude, if they do not result in production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.043" offset="5175568">Otherwise, this is a straight tracking of the Louisiana law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.032" offset="5199496">And provided further, if in the said ten-year period of reservation, if not extended as here above provided or the termination of any extended period, the operation has not been that carried on the right to provide and so forth, shall terminate and complete fee title so thereby it become vested in United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.634" offset="5281938">Then, I think there is an important royalty provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.277" offset="5300433">If Your Honor please, this simply is saying that if this conditional extinguishment and it is fairly conditional because it depends on the will of the servitude on as to whether you drill or not drill occurs, then of course the mineral right is terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.446" offset="5377128">That of course would be true in the case of statutory prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.369" offset="5392802">So, we say that it's a single exception Your Honor, of the limitation just place on the drilling that there’s no difference between this contract reservation and one that would be made under the law of Louisiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="1374.753" offset="5602408">United States was the largest purchaser of lands in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.125" offset="5615888">It was having increase in trouble buying lands because the people did not want to sell and have their mineral rights possibly terminated in 10 years, and as a result of that, in order to facilitate its purchase of the land in Louisiana, this Act was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.747" offset="5682343">Now, it’s a valid reason too because Louisiana is an oil rich state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.396" offset="5708988">It’s almost impossible to purchase lands at any price if the minerals are not reserve in tracks of in sizeable size.</text>
