            <text syncTime="42.079" offset="272677">This is a sex discrimination case.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.863" offset="283857">After a short statement of the facts here, I will seek to refute the Government’s statistical analysis of the case and point to what we consider to be then substantiability of the Government’s interest in continuing this particular sex discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.589" offset="354701">Following this, I will speak briefly about the merits of judging sex classifications by what we consider to be an intermediate test.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.224" offset="393258">Professor Ginsburg to my left will then speak on the merits of judging these cases by standard of strict scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.952" offset="432232">A year after entering the Armed Forces in 1968, Lieutenant Sharron Frontiero married Joseph Frontiero.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.850" offset="463788">Because of the statutes which are at issue here, any male member of the Armed Forces would have automatically become entitled to certain housing allowance benefits and medical benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.140" offset="516974">Lieutenant Frontiero did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.750" offset="531393">The statutes giving males in the Armed Forces the irrebuttable presumption, that their spouses are dependent, and grant benefits regardless of the wives’ actual financial dependency.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.958" offset="592206">A female must prove that her spouse is in fact dependent upon her for more than one-half of his support.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.509" offset="630450">In this case, Lieutenant Frontiero earns more than three times as much as her husband Joseph.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.899" offset="651975">Her income is approximately $8,200.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.254" offset="661379">His income is just a little in excess of $2,800.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.906" offset="684053">But because Joseph’s individual expenses are low, his small income meets more than half of his personal expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.913" offset="724072">Now, Sharron was therefore denied any supplemental benefits in both housing and medical for her spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.935" offset="752180">It’s undisputed that under these statutes, the ones which are at issue here that male Armed Forces member would have received this housing and medical benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.604" offset="794812">So we have a two-fold discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.485" offset="802335">The first is procedural.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.458" offset="814247">Women are forced to the burdens and uncertainties of proving that their spouses are in fact dependent upon them while males are given the benefits automatically and irrefutably.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.981" offset="868268">But more importantly, there’s a substantive discrimination here.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.101" offset="888748">Males whose wives are not financially dependent upon them, nevertheless receive these housing and medical benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.009" offset="924484">Women in precisely the same circumstances, identical circumstances do not receive the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.993" offset="960324">And the Government really seeks to explain a way this discrimination by saying that it’s only a procedural difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.118" offset="992820">And that since women earn less than men that they can presume for the sake, and I’m talking about women in the general population that they can presume for the sake of administrative convenience or administrative ease that the male spouses are financially dependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.825" offset="1067739">We have three relatively simple answers to the Government’s contention that lower income shows dependency.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.602" offset="1098773">First of all, earning levels don’t alone necessarily indicate dependency only because --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="256.914" stopTime="259.870">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="256.914" offset="1132001">Did they indicate a general tendency, do you think?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_j_levin_jr" startTime="259.870" stopTime="389.572">
            <label>Mr. Joseph J. Levin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="259.870" offset="1143912">I think that earning level, not necessary even a general tendency I would think that you could say that in the whole population that it does indicate a tendency that men earn more than women, and we don’t dispute that.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.533" offset="1198561">We don’t dispute that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.190" offset="1209114">But the only reason that Joseph Frontiero’s expense that the -- only because his expenses are low as he is technically not one-half financially dependent upon his wife, Sharron Frontiero, which is the criteria and the standard that women are forced to submit to under these statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.520" offset="1294482">And this is -- in spite of the fact that his income is less than one-third of her income.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.155" offset="1321023">So, though we feel that income and expenses are relevant in this case, the Government wants to take into account only income.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.858" offset="1355818">If they really believe that income is the only predictor of dependency then why not make that the standard for determining dependency.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.523" offset="1398450">Instead, they take a biological class, women, and they ascribe the status to the entire class without reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.222" offset="1437320">If they believe that lower income equals dependency then let them protect their own interest by making that, that is income the criterion and in the sex discrimination they could do this with a narrowly drawn statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.480" offset="1502312">Now, we doubt that what the Government refers to in its brief as, if I recall correctly, economic facts of life are really facts at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.943" offset="1548184">Their own statistics is set out on page 51 of our own blue brief show that Armed Forces males actually are earn less than females.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.723" offset="1591338">Now, if lower income equals dependency then the majority of Armed Forces males who are now granted in irrefutable presumption, would not be able to prove their spouses dependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.964" offset="1636268">Now, they say that our use of this kind of comparison is unfair kind of like mixing apples and oranges.</text>

            <text syncTime="428.181" offset="1817140">Now, let’s say that the Government is correct in what they have to say about our analysis that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.534" offset="1846502">They suggest that we should instead use the figure for all women instead of just women in the working population.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.508" offset="1878476">Well, let’s do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.281" offset="1885477">Now the census shows that for all women and this is for everyone over the age of 14, regardless of whether or not they are employed that for all women as a median income of $2,400.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.705" offset="1927168">And if we lump the military male’s median income which is $3,700 with the median income for the female, we come up with a $6,100 lump sum median.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.367" offset="1985891">Now, the dependency standard we recall is one-half in fact or one-half dependency.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.272" offset="2013477">For a woman to fail to provide, that is the wife of an Air Force or any Armed Services member for him -- for her to fail to provide, one-half of her own support, she would have to have expenses that total $4,800 which would be over 80% of the entire family’s income.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.765" offset="2087455">Now, we don’t think that the Government can prove or saying here that service family's wives such spendthrifts, I don’t believe this anyway to prove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.694" offset="2131132">But this whole analytical approach of statistics is extremely misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.662" offset="2151090">We don’t think that it has any particular relevance in this case because the crucial aspect of it is the substantive inequality which results here.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.767" offset="2187452">And that is that when you get right down to the bottom that males who cannot prove their wives dependent, nevertheless, receive the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.700" offset="2239175">Women in the identical position do not and there’s no way to cure that.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.778" offset="2255475">There’s no way to cure that in Sharron Frontiero’s case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1070.111" offset="4384872">Appellees stated in answer to interrogatories in this case that they remained totally uninformed on the application of this stereotype to serve as families that is they do not know whether the proportion of wage-earning wives of servicemen is small, large, or middle size.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.398" offset="4470032">What is known is that by employing the sex criterion, identically situated persons are treated differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.743" offset="4503364">The married serviceman gets benefits for himself, as well as his spouse regardless of her income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.785" offset="4535547">The married servicewoman is denied medical care for her spouse and quarter's allowance for herself as well as her spouse even if as in this case, she supplies over two-thirds the support of the marital unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.549" offset="4598554">For these reasons, amicus believes that the sex-related means employed by Congress fails to meet the rationality standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.992" offset="4632409">It does not have a fair and substantial relationship to the legislative objective so that all similarly circumstanced persons shall be treated alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.553" offset="4670652">Nonetheless, amicus urges the Court to recognize in this case what it has in others, that it writes not only for this case and this day alone, but for this type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.620" offset="4738884">As is apparent from the decisions cited at pages 27 to 34 of our brief, in lower federal as well as state courts, the standard of review in sex discrimination cases is to say the least confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.302" offset="4801578">A few courts have ranked sex as a suspect criterion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.322" offset="4821640">Others, including apparently the court below in this case, seem to regard the Reed decision as a direction to apply minimal scrutiny and there are various shades between.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.327" offset="4881721">The result is that in many instances, the same or similar issues are decided differently depending upon the court’s view of the stringency of review appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.176" offset="4937101">To provide the guidance so badly needed and because recognition is long overdue, amicus urges the Court to declare sex a suspect criterion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.252" offset="4985375">This would not be quite the giant step appellee suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.647" offset="5003034">As Professor Gunther observed in an analysis of last term’s equal protection decisions published in the November 1972 Harvard Law Review, it appears that in Reed, some special suspicion of sex as a classification factor entered into the Court’s analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.429" offset="5082133">Appellees concede that the principle ingredient involving strict scrutiny is present in the sex criterion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.921" offset="5116092">Sex like race is a visible, immutable characteristic bearing no necessary relationship to ability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.962" offset="5152246">Sex like race has been made the basis for unjustified or at least unproved assumptions, concerning an individual’s potential to perform or to contribute to society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.564" offset="5202610">But appellees point out that although the essential ingredient rendering a classification suspect is present, sex-based distinctions unlike racial distinctions do not have an especially disfavored constitutional history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.107" offset="5272827">It is clear that the core purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to eliminate invidious racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.059" offset="5308667">But why did the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment regard racial discrimination as odious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.182" offset="5333117">Because a person’s skin color bears no necessary relationship to ability, similarly as appellees’ concede, a person’s sex bears no necessary relationship to ability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.602" offset="5390796">Moreover, national origin and alienage have been recognized as suspect classifications, although the new comers to our shores was not the paramount concern of the nation when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.406" offset="5454012">But the main thrust of the argument against recognition of sex as a suspect criterion centers on two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.199" offset="5501241">First, women are a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.169" offset="5517124">Second, legislative classification by sex does not, it is asserted, imply the inferiority of women.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.802" offset="5555576">With respect to the numbers argument, the numerical majority was denied even the right to vote until 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.369" offset="5593924">Women today face discrimination in employment as pervasive and more subtle than discrimination encountered by minority groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.393" offset="5638019">In vocational and higher education, women continue to face restrictive quotas no longer operative with respect to other population groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.974" offset="5684308">Their absence is conspicuous in Federal and State Legislative, Executive, and Judicial Chambers in higher civil service positions and in appointed posts in federal, state, and local government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.822" offset="5743658">Surely, no one would suggest that race is not a suspect criterion in the District of Columbia because the black population here outnumbers the white.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.702" offset="5791201">Moreover, as Mr. Justice Douglas has pointed out most recently in Hadley against Alabama 41 Law Week 3205, Equal Protection and Due Process of law apply to the majority as well as to the minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.822" offset="5863717">Due to sex classifications listed by appellees imply a judgment of inferiority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.019" offset="5896422">Even the Court below suggested that they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.706" offset="5911259">That court said it would be remiss if it failed to notice lurking in the background the subtle injury inflicted on servicewomen, the indignity of being treated differently so many of them feel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.657" offset="5979073">Sex classifications do stigmatize when as in Goesaert against Cleary 235 U.S., they exclude women from an occupation thought more appropriate to men.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.890" offset="6027975">The sex criterion stigmatizes when it is used to limit hours of work for women only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.457" offset="6054201">Hours regulations of the kind involved in Muller against Oregon though perhaps reasonable on the turn of the century conditions, today protect women from competing for extra remuneration, higher paying jobs, promotions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.769" offset="6127449">The sex criterion stigmatizes when as in Hoyt against Florida 368 U.S, it assumes that all women are preoccupied with home and children and therefore should be spared the basic civic responsibility of serving on a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.247" offset="6197352">These distinctions have a common effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.253" offset="6209369">They help keep woman in her place, a place inferior to that occupied by men in our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.488" offset="6246358">Appellees recognize that there is doubt as to the contemporary validity of the theory that sex classifications do not brand the female sex as inferior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.096" offset="6292752">But they advocate a hold the line position by this Court unless and until the equal rights amendment comes into force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.332" offset="6337682">Absent the equal rights amendment, appellees assert, no close scrutiny of sex based classifications is warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.976" offset="6372268">This Court should stand pat on legislation of the kind involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.056" offset="6396615">Legislation making a distinction, servicewomen regard as the most frozen equity, the greatest irritant and the most discriminatory provision relating to women in the middle -- in the military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.337" offset="6453770">But this Court has recognized that the notion of what constitutes equal protection does change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.043" offset="6488566">Proponents as well as opponents of the equal rights amendment believe that clarification of the application of equal protection to the sex criterion is needed and should come from this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1703.336" offset="6917705">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.464" offset="6934215">A position of the Government in this case is first that there is a rational basis for the different treatment of male and female members of the Armed Forces in the statute here under review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.133" offset="6984892">And second, that the rational basis standard is the proper standard for determining the validity of those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.360" offset="7021881">I would like to first address myself to the statutes and then discuss the appropriate standard of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.276" offset="7057512">I think it would be useful to begin by reviewing the actual impact of the housing allowance and medical care statutes here in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.945" offset="7096174">The housing allowance statute is 37 U.S.C. 403 grants a basic housing allowance to each member of the military for whom on-base housing is not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.088" offset="7152703">In addition, each such member is entitled to an increased housing allowance if he has one or more dependents as defined by 37 U.S.C. 401.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.804" offset="7199619">Under the scale which is now in existence, for example, a lieutenant in Pay Grade II would be entitled to $138.60 for -- per month for housing without dependents and $175.80 with dependents, a difference of $37.20.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.326" offset="7297735">Now, the particular issue here of course concerns under what circumstances a member of the Armed Forces may claim a spouse as a dependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.912" offset="7336082">And the general rule under the statute is that wives of male members qualified automatically for dependency benefits, whereas husbands of female members qualify only if dependent in fact on their wives for over half of their support.</text>

            <text syncTime="1864.155" offset="7561049">The -- I’d like to point out that under 37 U.S.C. 420 in the case of an inter-service marriage, neither the husband nor the wife may claim his or her spouse as a dependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.426" offset="7622071">Now, this fact has considerable importance here for a significant majority of married women in the Armed Force are married to military men.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.028" offset="7664494">Now while the record is silent on this matter, the Senate Report issued on the proposals in Congress last year to amend these statutes contained a letter from the general counsel of the Department of Defense which is in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.503" offset="7718410">In the letter, at page 4 of the report that’s Senate Report 92-1218, it is noted that a recently completed survey of married women in the Air Force show that 25% of the officers were married, but that only 4% of the officers were married to civilians and the percentage of all women in the Air Force married to civilians is even smaller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.145" offset="7828961">In not being able to claim their husbands as dependents, military women married to military men are not discriminated against since their husbands could not claim them either.</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel Huntington</label>
            <text syncTime="1953.755" offset="7919449">One way, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.140" offset="7928957">Well, this is also true that these women who married the military men are not discriminated with respect to medical benefits because under 10 U.S.C. 1074 both the husband and the wife would qualify for medical benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.349" offset="7997816">Well, in short then the only women who are treated differently then their male counterparts are those women who are married to civilian.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.147" offset="8044941">Now, in our view, one does not have to search far to discover a rational basis for Congress’ decision to treat married men and married women differently with respect to dependency benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.167" offset="8097081">We start with the basic purpose of the two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.413" offset="8114009">And the basic purpose is to provide housing allowance and medical benefits for dependents in order to establish a compensation pattern which would attract career personnel into the Armed Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.032" offset="8180569">In Congress’ view, this would enable the military to compete with the civilian sector of the economy for married people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.848" offset="8219752">Now in establishing these benefits, Congress had to determine what proof of dependency it would require.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.306" offset="8249637">Now, an examination of this statute shows that where it was very likely that a military person would be supporting certain relatives, dependency benefits were conferred automatically where it would be less likely or unusual that a military member would be supporting a person, proof of dependency was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.725" offset="8331348">Thus, under 37 U.S.C. 401, a serviceman’s wife and minor children automatically qualify for dependency benefits, whereas, his older children and his parents would qualify only if dependent in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.527" offset="8394459">And since women, generally do not provide the main support for their husbands, children, or parents, servicewomen were required to establish to establish dependency in fact in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.098" offset="8460810">Let me state this in other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.077" offset="8472722">Taking the over one million married military men as a group, a significant majority of their wives are the dependent upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.216" offset="8513264">Under these circumstances, it is rational to decide to grant all married men dependency benefits for their wives automatically rather than undertaking the heavy administrative burden of determining dependency in fact in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.204" offset="8585258">On the other hand, taking the one or two thousand military women who are married to civilians as a group, an overwhelming majority of their husbands are not dependent upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.502" offset="8634368">Under these circumstances, it is rational to examine individually the few instances where a military woman might have a dependent husband.</text>

            <text syncTime="2224.929" offset="9004157">In the statistical abstract of the United States which is a document which is cited in our brief is a table that shows that in 1970, in white families where both the husband and wife worked and the husband is under 35; the main contribution of the wife to the total family income was 27.1%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.142" offset="9096944">That’s at the table at page 327 of the statistical abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.256" offset="9121395">In comparable, black families, the main contribution the wife was slightly higher at 33.4%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.176" offset="9165072">In short, there can be no question but that husbands still provide the primary income in most families.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.615" offset="9194851">In many families, they provide the only income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.436" offset="9206136">In the remaining families, their aggregate contribution to the total family income, totally eclipses the aggregate contribution of working wives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.057" offset="9264650">Now, if that is true today, we submit that 23 years ago and 17 years ago when the statutes here were passed, it was even true to a greater extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.477" offset="9314283">Now on the other side of the coin, it can hardly be disputed that most men are not dependent upon their wives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.792" offset="9339570">As we note in our brief, almost all married work and in families were both the husband and the wife work, the husband’s income is generally well above the wife's.</text>

            <text syncTime="2656.050" offset="10728552">I’d like to turn now to the Reed and Reed case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.570" offset="10742659">In that case, as you will recall the Court reviewed an Idaho statute which provided that when competing applications to administer an estate were filed by a man and a woman in the same priority group, the man was to be given preference and appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.597" offset="10814757">Now there is no evidence in the record that men as a class were better administrators than women and the Court rejected the contention that measure was justified to save litigation costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.214" offset="10877241">In short, there are no differences in the two classes of applicants, men and women which justify the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.520" offset="10914440">By contrast, there are very real and relevant statistical differences between married military men as a class and married women which justify the, in our view justify the classifications under review in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.924" offset="10996046">I would like to turn now to the question of the appropriate standard to be applied under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to determine the validity of these statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.898" offset="11068040">To begin with, as this Court has held a numerous cases, traditional principles of equal protection developed under the Fourteenth Amendment are relevant in considering a tax under the Fifth Amended alleging that federal statutes unjustifiably discriminate between different classes of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.436" offset="11154139">Now as already as been touched upon here today, the traditional equal protection tests is the rational basis test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.316" offset="11189666">Although originally developed in cases involving statutes regulating business, the test has been applied in recent years to cases involving economic and social benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.564" offset="11254659">Now as both Mr. Levin and Professor Ginsburg have pointed out, the Court has imposed a stricter standard of review with respect to statutory classifications in two types of cases; those involving classifications which affect fundamental personal rights and those involving inherently suspect classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.257" offset="11349431">As far as the personal rights are concerned, I would disagree with Mr. Levin that personal rights of the type which bring in to play this, the standard are involved here, the rights are two dependency benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.246" offset="11409408">These are the same type of economic benefits which were under review in the Dandridge case and I think it’s not the type of personal rights which were under consideration in the Weber case which involved the relationship between illegitimate children and legitimate children within the family unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.638" offset="11502926">The rights here so we would say that the stricter review if it’s going to apply at all in this case, it must be because sex is a suspect classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.555" offset="11578577">Let me just comment briefly on Professor Gunther’s article in the Harvard Law Review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.357" offset="11605849">He suggested there that in recent cases, this Court has not been limited simply to one, the polar extremes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.035" offset="11648585">But that in reviewing statutes the Court has been taking a fairly close look even when applying the rational basis test to determine whether there is in fact some Government interest involved which can -- which is readily apparent and you don’t have to stretch the imagination to come up with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.550" offset="11750567">We would submit that in this case, the classifications here would stand scrutiny under that type of approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.275" offset="11801454">I would like to turn now to Professor Ginsburg’s argument that classifications based on sex are suspect for equal protection and due process purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.724" offset="11851295">To begin with, as Professor Ginsburg acknowledges, this Court has never treated classifications based on sex as inherently suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.538" offset="11886508">And only last term in Reed against Reed applied the traditional rational basis test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.564" offset="11918691">In our view, the Court should not now abandon the traditional test and treat sex classifications as suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.417" offset="11950038">Just last week in the Crest (ph) decision, which upheld the $50 filing fee for requirement as a pre-condition to discharge and bankruptcy, the Court referred to the suspect criteria of race, nationality, and alienage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.727" offset="12035302">Now, race classifications of course have an especially disfavored status in our constitutional history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.234" offset="12069366">And each of the three classifications in the words of Justice Blackmun in Graham against Richardson involves and I quote “a discreet and insular minority for whom heightened judicial solicitude is appropriate.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.582" offset="12138747">Now these minorities generally lack the political power to protect their own interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.662" offset="12171034">Now, we are not contending that women have achieved equal political power with men.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.526" offset="12194544">The statistics cited by Professor Ginsburg as to the number of women in high government positions in state and federal legislatures are certainly not in dispute, they’re very small.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.893" offset="12247939">What we do suggest is that because they are a numerical majority in the population as a whole, they have been exercising substantial and growing political influence upon state and federal legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.769" offset="12319514">At the federal level, as summarized in the ACLU’s brief, there has been considerable legislative activity in amending statutes containing classifications based on sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.946" offset="12372177">Proposed legislation to amend these statutes as I’ve already stated, was before Congress last year and undoubtedly will be before Congress this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.815" offset="12415645">And also of course the equal rights amendment which was passed last year is evidence -- is an indication of the influence that women who favor the amendment have been able to exert.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.435" offset="12506133">There is another reason for not expanding the category of suspect classifications to include women.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.109" offset="12536853">Unlike classifications based on race, nationality, or alienage, classifications based on sex frequently are not arbitrary, but reflect the actual differences between the sexes which are relevant to the purpose of the statutes containing the classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.917" offset="12616056">Now, we contend here that the dependency statutes, for example, do not discriminate against women because of their femininity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.002" offset="12652419">They treat women differently because women as a class are less likely to have dependents than men.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.933" offset="12688154">Similarly, the Florida statute upheld that Hoyt against Florida did not excuse women from jury duty because they were inferior, but excused them because of the fact that women as class were more likely than men to have family responsibilities, making it impractical for them to serve as jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.090" offset="12784807">Application of the rational basis test permits the Courts to consider statutes on a case by case basis to determine which classifications are based on valid factual or physiological differences between the sexes and which classifications like the one struck down in Reed and Reed are arbitrary and not based on sex differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.568" offset="12890655">On the other hand, denominating sex classifications as suspect would subject all statutes containing sex classifications to strict review and could result in invalidating many of them whether or not individual classifications reflect acknowledged factual or physiological differences.</text>

            <text syncTime="3580.810" offset="14427596">I believe that that would extend the benefits to all, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.426" offset="14442120">I think the Government has misconstrued the basic question here and the basic purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.592" offset="14474721">The basic purpose of these statutes in the legislative history shows this is to extend these benefits to men and women, that’s the language that the legislature use and the proponents of the legislation used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.079" offset="14524667">And the idea was to encourage re-enlistment of men and women and it said more than once, so that is the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.675" offset="14555073">Anything else, would be inconsistent with the basic purpose of the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.340" offset="14573777">I think we lose sight of the issue that no matter how many figures are thrown after the court that nevertheless you get right down to rock-bottom, women who are identically situated to men as in the case of Lieutenant Frontiero don’t receive either housing benefits or medical benefits and there can’t be no justification for that kind of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.691" offset="14655175">The Government talked in terms of forms that have to be filled out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.887" offset="14671893">Well, I know for military experience that there are hundred forms that have to be filled out when you go in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.317" offset="14693627">Men, all service people have to inform the Government as to how many dependents they have and a variety of other items in order to determine initially what kind of payments they might be eligible to receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.508" offset="14750469">So you’re not asking for any, if you extend it all the way around, you certainly wouldn’t be asking for any extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.866" offset="14775860">You just have to require a quality of root, I prefer to call it that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.385" offset="14805953">This Senate Bill has been discussed by the Government, of course, is speculative and it's only perspective as I read it would not apply whatsoever to assist Lieutenant Frontiero and her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.891" offset="14859975">I think in Reed versus Reed that the lower court there talked in terms of a difference and the experience of men and women and attempted to justify the classification that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.500" offset="14914414">Well, statistics in that case could just as easily have shown that more than in any business world than are women and that con -- and have more and consequently, they have more experience of the classification would then be justified, once again, under the administrative convenience justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.026" offset="15004484">I think you get into a problem when you try and ask the question what is the definition of dependency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.558" offset="15022665">The Government seems to want to use one-half dependent in the case of women who are seeking to have their husbands as dependents but to use another classification that is just general dependency of bread winning in the case of men, and we think that this cannot in any way be justified.</text>
