            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We’ll hear arguments next in 71-1222, Sugarman against Mc Dougall.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.314" offset="232678">Mr. Hirshowitz, you may proceed.</text>

          <turn speaker="samuel_a_hirshowitz" startTime="33.562" stopTime="842.184">
            <label>Mr. Samuel A. Hirshowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="33.562" offset="237589">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.820" offset="254621">This case involves the question of validity of a Section of the New York State Civil Service Law the -- which the -- a three-judge District Court held invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.539" offset="325569">The particular language that the Court dealt with is found on page 91 of the record in a footnote, “Except as herein otherwise provided, no person shall be eligible for appointment for any position in the competitive class unless he is a citizen of the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="83.883" offset="438941">There is a second subdivision which doesn’t appear in the record but which is discussed in the opinion which provides that where the appointing authority cannot find any person to fill a position, he may apply to the Local Civil Service Commission or to the State Civil Service Commission and if they are satisfied that there is no one available for that position they may certify this appointment which last only for the -- to the end of the year and cannot be continued unless this appointee has taken steps to become a citizen by filing a declaration of intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.199" offset="684178">The particular appellees here were appointed by the City of New York as provisional appointees.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.082" offset="731721">That means they never took any examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.884" offset="754918">As provisionals they were entitled to hold their position at the discretion of the appointing authority for a period of which is generally regarded as nine months provided that there was no eligible list, and in this case the answer of the City of New York shows that there was an eligible list established but in this case, the appellees would terminate it not because of the existence of the eligible list but because of the existence of this statute the City of New York found that they were not citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.399" offset="932968">The Civil Service System in New York as this Court knows is based on the merit system and the competitive class which is established after examination and qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.441" offset="1001096">One who is appointed after examination obtains rights of tenure, seniority and promotional preferences together with pension benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.885" offset="1066924">The appellees have been residents according to their affidavits have been residents in the City of New York for varying years.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.955" offset="1111228">Some six years, some ten years and none of them have taken even the first step to obtain citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.729" offset="1154278">The first appellee, Mc Dougall for instance was a resident to the City of New York since 1964 and never took any steps to become a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.571" offset="1217703">None of the appellees, because of a question of preemption which will be discussed, none of the appellees were ever certified by United States Secretary of Labor for the position he or she was filling.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.343" offset="1280711">As a matter of fact, Mc Dougall was the only one that took an examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.942" offset="1311117">And let me point out that prior to 1968, the statute which I read provided that nobody could take an examination for our position but that was altered and amended to provide that no one could be appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.877" offset="1386872">The difference being that one who is an alien could take the examination and the meantime take steps to become a citizen as the usual process that takes from six months to a year before the examinations are marked and a list established, and the list one established is usually good for varying period of three to five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.721" offset="1506304">The District Court in this case sustained the appellee’s challenge on both Equal Protection and Supremacy Clause grounds relying principally on a case decided by this Court, Graham against Richardson which we are sure was misapplied.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.449" offset="1605151">The Graham case has spawned a flock of litigation in various federal courts throughout the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.075" offset="1643708">According to our computation, there are seven cases in various federal courts and various stages of litigation raising questions as to the validity of discrimination against aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.761" offset="1730435">Let me also point out that the Federal Government has a quibbling practice which is as a result of authority given to this Civil Service Commission to establish the conditions of employment and by Executive Order aliens have been barred from United States employment except the same way as New York does.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.483" offset="1857285">Certification where there's no available employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.658" offset="1874004">The -- in addition to that, Congress in the annual appropriation bills has specifically provided that no payment of compensation can be made to an employee if he is not a citizen of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.314" offset="1948609">That is an employee on American soil.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.670" offset="1974000">A copy of the federal provision, we have attached to our brief as exhibit 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.994" offset="2047352">And in this Court here, the appellees have persisted in the claim at the right to travel of the aliens as being interfered with as if they ever posses such right which is important in part in this case and they have apparently, as we read their briefs, argued that the statute is overbroad which was not a contention what was made below.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.203" offset="2188204">In the sense that the lower grade of employees should not be barred by this statutory provision but the higher grade employees may be barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.560" offset="2249644">The first question that suggests itself is whether there is any equation of equal protection available to the appellees whether the court was right in considering equal protection at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.514" offset="2321429">We suggest that his very precedent and principle required this Court to hold that the States have not been by divested of the power to limits its public employees as citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.434" offset="2381093">And that this power is not affected by Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.915" offset="2415052">This does not involved the consideration of the question of rights or privileges which is being blurred by the decisions of this Court by the question of any entitlement at all to consideration for employment, public employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.432" offset="2513063">The question was on the consideration in the Crane against United States and in that case this Court held valid New York state statute which provided at that time that employment on perfect contracts could be limited to citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.858" offset="2634794">And the question that to state the Court in the discussion was a question not whether public employment could be limited to citizens but as to whether the public contractors were in effect the Government when engage in public contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.093" offset="2735731">The District Court relied to some extent on the Truax case which was decided by the same Court at the same time and in the same volume of the reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.414" offset="2808978">In the Truax case, the Court struck down an Arizona statute that forbids the employment of aliens generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.297" offset="2864567">At the same time, it was very careful to point out in its opinion that it did not -- that that case did not involved the appointment of citizens in public employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.836" offset="2962683">In the Crane on the question of equal protection the Court concluded what the words -- there is added a view that a distinction between aliens and citizens violates the principles of classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.072" offset="3035617">We think this is also without foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.832" offset="3050663">And in the Truax case, Chief Justice Hughes said, that the challenge here is not limited to persons who are engaged in public work but that have passed from the employment in the entire field of the industry in all common occupations.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.752" offset="3138330">The Crane case came from the New York Court of Appeals and Judge Cardozo who later said on this Court, distinguished the Truax situation and the Crane situation in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.270" offset="3208443">It must be evident that nothing in this opinion gives confidence to the view that the Government may deny to aliens the right to engaged in any private trade or calling on times of equality with citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.459" offset="3273226">It is true that in dealings between man and man, the alien and the citizen trade labor on equal terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.229" offset="3308335">It is the denial of equal protection of laws when the Government in its capacity as lawmaker regulating not its own property but private business bars the alien from the right to trade and labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.193" offset="3372178">It is therefore our contention that the Crane case in its present under the facts in this case is authoritative, this position by this Court for the view that the Equal Protection Clause does not apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="863.824" offset="3558693">The Equal Protection Clause of course is applicable to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.512" offset="3577396">But in the -- on the question of whether aliens entitled to public employment, it’s our first position that the Equal Protection Clause does not apply because of the Tenth Amendment Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.706" offset="3642180">When the Constitution was adopted from historic times, the States were obtained and continued with the right to run their own Government except in so far as expressly interfered with by the United States Constitution and there's nothing in United States Constitution and it would appear to me to do a violence to the Government of the States or either by judicial decree or congressional act to interfere with the Government to the States and to provide that aliens must be employed by the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.975" offset="3831306">Now, this is not a novel in Oregon against Mitchell, Chief Justice Black in discussing the 18-year-old vote case.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.363" offset="3884805">It said in part, “it cannot be successfully argued that the Fourteenth Amendment was intended to strip the States of their power, carefully preserved in the original Constitution, to govern themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.813" offset="3958575">The Fourteenth Amendment was surely not intended to make every discrimination between groups of people a constitutional denial of equal protection.”</text>
            <text syncTime="977.509" offset="4013432">And in the Maryland against Wirtz, justice -- Mr. Justice Douglas said in connection with the Bill which -- a law which as this Court will remember dealt with minimum wages of certain classes of state employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.026" offset="4115519">Mr. Justice Douglas said in his dissent that it would snuff out state’s sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.681" offset="4142059">“If all this can be done, then the National Government could devour the essentials of state sovereignty, though, that sovereignty is attested by the Tenth Amendment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.885" offset="4198902">And then he went on to quote Mr. Justice Stone in the case New York against United States where Chief Justice Stone said, “The National Government may not interfere unduly with the State’s performance of its sovereign, sovereign functions of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.124" offset="4279881">It may not impair this State’s function of Government.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.263" offset="4296391">Now, below the three-judge-court in its opinion disregard the fact that the -- this country and its various subdivisions is not only a Government of the people, it’s a Government by the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.147" offset="4411956">And by the people means, the citizens of this land and this includes -- this excludes the right to compel aliens to be employed by the state or its subdivisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1129.068" offset="4619682">New York as some paper show has paid welfare to aliens from the beginning of the welfare system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.341" offset="4656776">As we read the Graham case, this Court was dealing with indigents and that case there the State involved was just trying to establish a crude economic preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.787" offset="4718529">Citizen was being provided when the necessities of life while the alien was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.084" offset="4747682">Although, the alien’s status bears absolutely no relationship to the alien’s needs as a recipient or to his contributions as a taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.857" offset="4802748">In contrast to welfare, Section 53, the statute on the discussion has concerned solely with maintaining the national character and the integrity and efficiency of the career civil service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.625" offset="4877876">Now, even if this Court holds that equal protection was properly made an issue below, its opposition that the right of the State to run its government by its own citizens by itself find issues, sufficient basis whatever tests of equal protection is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.476" offset="4985292">All nations and states conduct their affairs through the agency of public employees and thus, practically every nation and state requires its agents including the career civil service be citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.605" offset="5045791">As this Court recognize in such cases as Afroyim against Rusk, citizens not aliens are members of state.</text>
