            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- this morning on number 72-549 and 72-550, School Board of Richmond against the State Board of Education and Bradley against the State Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.664" offset="166013">Mr. Coleman, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. William T. Coleman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="21.294" offset="188583">Good Morning Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.631" offset="205928">The basic issue here is whether 19 years after Brown, State created school division lines which were bamboo curtains in the cause of school segregation in Virginia, lines which were freely and repeatedly crossed and ignored to maintain segregated schools in Virginia, now become iron curtains constituting an absolute bar to the effective desegregation plan before the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.414" offset="329017">For in this case, the District Court found as a fact that Virginia through its spate school officials, its legislature and its school division, including that of Richmond, repeatedly and consistently violated the Black petitioner's constitutional right to attend public schools free from state sponsored racial segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.857" offset="434761">In other words, the question here is whether a District Court is without power to prove a desegregation relief plan, solely because it involves inner division of assignment of pupils among adjacent divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.317" offset="500590">And if this Court determines that that power does exists, was there a gross abuse of discretion to exercise it here when the record includes undisturbed findings that; one, Virginia including the three sub -- the three school divisions here involved, repeatedly ignored the division lines to revert to preserve segregated schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.961" offset="603199">Second, that it was no longer possible to achieve effective and complete desegregation within the confines of Virginia -- of Richmond school division itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.970" offset="659205">Third, that repeated unconstitutional acts and intentional delays directed by Virginia created this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.627" offset="693896">Fourth, the school division line served no useful administrative or educational purpose and the result of such failure would to be to have black and white schools within walking distance of each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.870" offset="750843">In addition, the two adjoining school divisions here involved, Henrico and Chesterfield, were themselves operating non-unitary racial system.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.070" offset="799640">Petitioners in number 72-550 are black school children.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.591" offset="829733">The defendants are the State Board of Education, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the three division, school superintendents who under Virginia law incidentally are centrally nominated.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.406" offset="885008">The legislative bodies of Richmond, Henrico and Chesterfield and the school boards of these three divisions, each of which under Virginia law is an administrative subdivision of the state.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="207.570" offset="933700">Id that the School Superintendents, Mr. Coleman, are centrally nominated?</text>

            <label>Mr. William T. Coleman, Jr.</label>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="210.906" offset="946970">What does that mean?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_t_coleman_jr" startTime="211.359" stopTime="496.030">
            <label>Mr. William T. Coleman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="211.359" offset="948851">Under Virginia law, it’s provided that the State Board of Education makes up a list of people eligible to be appointed and the school divisions can appoint only from that list.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.339" offset="1000678">And in fact, the Virginia law provides that if within 60 days the person is not appointed if there is a vacancy, the State Board itself makes the appointment and incidentally in this case, the school’s superintendent of the division of Chesterfield was appointed in that manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.946" offset="1079150">He was appointed by the State because Chesterfield within 60 days had not made the appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.902" offset="1102973">Now from 1871 until the time of the Brown decision, Virginia’s constitution, its statues and all of it’s policy making authorities compel each school division to operate racially segregated schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.259" offset="1172459">At the time of the Brown decision, the school population of the Richmond division was 43% black and 57% white.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.744" offset="1210389">In Chesterfield, it was 21% black and 79% white.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.872" offset="1230869">In Henrico, it was 11% black and 89% white.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.392" offset="1248946">For the three divisions together, however, the composite figure was 33.7% black and 66.3% white.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.411" offset="1288965">And as I stated before in each division regardless of what the local division would want to do, by state law, black and white had to attend wholly separate schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.068" offset="1339643">Now unfortunately, Brown brought no change whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.700" offset="1358137">On pages 18 through 22 of our brief, we recount the very successful state actions by state officials with School Division Cooperation to keep Virginia schools segregated into position, then a statute under which the Governor would takeover any school which voluntarily or by quota admitted blacks, then a Pupil Placement Law and then the State Tuitions Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.754" offset="1458343">Now the Pupil Placement Law as this Court knows was particularly effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.791" offset="1474539">As stated in Bradley, it took out of the hands of the school boards and school superintendent any decision relating to the integration of the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.694" offset="1514141">And so in 1961, these black petitioners brought a class action on behalf of all black children in Virginia against State officials and quoting the Richmond School Division to be admitted to white schools despite the provision of the Pupil Placement Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.214" offset="1588224">The District Court granted limited relief, but not class relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.691" offset="1606092">The Court of Appeals reversed directing class reliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.437" offset="1621138">The Commonwealth and the Richmond School Division, then sought to invert the impact of this decision by introducing a freedom of choice plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.539" offset="1661576">This plan was accepted by the Court of Appeals, but this Court reversed because the plan failed to deal with desegregation of teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.501" offset="1693341">It was now 1966, 12 years after Brown, a consent decree was added into involving of freedom of choice plan, placing the affirmative duty on school authorities to modify free choice, if it did not result in effective desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.983" offset="1767320">Unfortunately, segregation continued, but the school officials took no action whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.405" offset="1793024">For this reason, the Black petitioners on March 10, 1970 filed for further relief pursuant to this Court's ruling in Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.500" offset="1829386">On that date, even though the composite racial make up of the three divisions had not altered, which you recall I said 33.7% black and 66.3% white, the makeup in Virginia had become 64.2% black and 35.8% white, while Chesterfield had become 9.5% black, 90% white and Henrico, 8.1% black and 91.9% white.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.762" offset="1958431">Now at that point, this is 1970 now, just two-and-a-half years ago, the Richmond School Board admitted that it had been and it was in violation of petitioner's constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.317" offset="2020603">The schools were still rigidly segregated and I would ask the Court to please turn to pages 167 and 168 of the appendix to the petition for certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="496.851" offset="2090820">167 A, Mr. Justice Brennan and 168 A and just look at the situation and this is 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.765" offset="2134392">Of the seven high schools, three were 100% black, one was 99.26% white.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.616" offset="2169814">In other words, six of the seven schools by any test you could make were clearly racially identifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.354" offset="2200743">The middle schools, six of the seven were clearly racially identifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.764" offset="2222477">The elementary schools, almost all of them were clearly racially identifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.930" offset="2243062">The faculty and staff were clearly racially identifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.844" offset="2262706">Now I am confident, now this is 16 years after Brown, I am confident that no one can stand up before the Bar of this Court and question the correctness of the District Court's resulting finding at pages 168 A, 169 A pardon me, where the court says that the schools were racially segregated, racially identifiable and violative of petitioner's constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.301" offset="2380570">Now frankly we find it impossible to characterize such contemporary facts as “history or original sin” as respondents do at Pages 47 and 73 of that brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.371" offset="2436890">At that point, the District Court's job was attempt to see that the school board would produce a plan which would effectively desegregate the public school.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.740" offset="2486314">The Richmond School Board continued to file inadequate interim plan which were approved only because of time pressure and the schools would have to open at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.080" offset="2535737">In each case, the court specifically found that these interim plans did not conform to constitutional requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.745" offset="2574399">Then on November 4, 1970, the Richmond School Board stating under oath that it was impossible to desegregate the schools in the context of Richmond, moved to join the adjacent divisions of Henrico and Chesterfield Counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.197" offset="2644198">The State Board of Education and the State Superintendent of Public Instructions and at that time, the Black petitioners filed a second amended complaint which again asked for relief on behalf of all children throughout Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.938" offset="2703130">They asked that the adjoining school divisions be included in a desegregation plan either by consolidation or by contractual arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.606" offset="2741791">Now after trial, and I wish the Court to follow me through these findings, that I really saying that in this case, unless you can upset these findings that this case has to be decided in favor of the Black petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.992" offset="2799365">That at trial, at the trial, full trial now, the District Court found --</text>

            <text syncTime="851.813" offset="3510627">It further found that past and continuing action by state authorities interfering with desegregation that a constitutional plan for the city and for the counties as well cannot be achieved within current school division boundaries, that findings are at 237A, 207A and 201A.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.124" offset="3599862">He concluded that the defendants should not be permitted to profit by self created problems and that's at page 237A.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.769" offset="3638418">Finally he found that at the time the record closed each division still operated a school system which was in some respect non-unitary.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.051" offset="3687528">The court never found, as respondents would have you believe by pages 8 of their brief that anyone of three divisions had ever achieved a unitary status and I ask you to look at the chart in the appendix to the court opinion which shows that each division operates racially identifiable school and the chart is in Volume II, beginning on page 524 where he takes the schools of Chesterfield county, then Henrico county and Richmond and I assure when you will examine those, you will find that in each instance in this record everyone of these schools were racially identifiable.</text>

            <text syncTime="973.700" offset="3998177">Now another thing that I would like to clear up in this case, the Judge never found and we don't urge that the absence of a quota gives rise to constitutional violation and I would just ask you to read page 519A of the record, once again in the same opinion, I mean the same, the opinion which is in the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.684" offset="4122102">Now once he found these massive constitutional violations, he had a constitutional duty to end them and in Charlotte the Swan case, in Davis this Court has said that once there is a violation the court should take all steps necessary to end that violation and to end the effects of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.159" offset="4220008">Now the only reason and the only thing that makes this case any different from Davis and Swann is something that the my friends tried to raise namely this division line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.762" offset="4266402">And I stand here and say once again, that in order to maintain segregated schools, this line was never observed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.380" offset="4316871">Students freely were taken back and forth across this line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.662" offset="4334007">You will find from this record now for example that the Kennedy School which is under the Richmond Division is actually situated in Henrico county and black children, Kennedy is now about 80% black and if you look at pages, 8 of our brief, we set out a table for you on page eight and here you have a situation where Kennedy High School built in 1967, opened as a Black school now over 80% Black, in fact is 93% Black as of now, that within four miles of that school is a Henrico High School which is 4% Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.452" offset="4533164">Now that's the problem that the District Judge had here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.429" offset="4545076">He looked at this map and he saw that you had a array in the Richmond School Division of Black schools measured by any test that you want to measure, tight on top of them, outside in the counties, in these counties, there were White schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.252" offset="4612368">Now certainly in Swann what you did was to approve a plan which said that you should desegregate the schools and that you send students by contiguous zones, by busing to these various places.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.736" offset="4686346">Now here the only reason is this line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.287" offset="4700557">Now I assure you, the record will show and will clearly show, this line is an arbitrary line, was never used to -- when there were segregated schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.476" offset="4761266">The judge found out at page 193A of the record in his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.070" offset="4787702">Also in the record at, this record now sir, at page 912, this testimony that under the State Tuition Law, when a black child would get the right to go to school in Richmond and then if the White parent didn't like it, he under the State Tuition Law as you know Mr. Justice White, would opt out and go some place else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.538" offset="4881533">That the state paid the tuition and the white child went out of the county, that's all in 912A of the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1308.977" offset="5339303">Well the nature was that under the Pupil Placement Law, when a Black person would apply to go to school in Richmond, the White family then had the right to send his child to some other school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.036" offset="5399489">He would then make an application to those schools in Henrico or those schools in Chesterfield and they would have take him, in fact the testimony [Attempt to Laughter] says that if for some reason Richmond would stand up and say no you cannot do that, the State would get back at them by just deducting from the next state grant check, the amount of the tuition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.057" offset="5483604">And so the testimony says we could not do anything about, this was State directed, we had to do it and the fact is that these children would cross these lines, all during that time and that is what the Judge found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.485" offset="5525295">In addition now in these counties there are special schools like the Science schools in one county, the children go across that line and nobody gets upset and it is only when it comes to desegregating the school that this line all of a sudden becomes the most sacrosanct thing in the world and we just do not think that under your cases that that is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.511" offset="5621426">And we also cited a lot of cases in the District Court on page 78 of our brief and I think it's footnote 121 where the Court of Appeals and the District Courts have repeatedly ordered that there would be an interchange of students if that was the only way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.088" offset="5695718">Mr. Justice White, what I am trying to say [Attempt to Laughter] when you have a line which is this ridiculous, never used, then under those circumstances, we can't say that, that becomes an absolute bar, and this case is just that simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.742" offset="5758307">Now as I said before that I think that the real issue here is one of whether the discretion was properly exercised and in my opening, I indicated to you the reason why I thought it was properly exercised.</text>

            <text syncTime="1453.721" offset="5918281">Alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.720" offset="5942209">As Mr. Coleman stated, the Richmond School Board an arm of the State of Virgina conceded that its schools were not being operated in accordance with constitutional requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.966" offset="6007202">In addition this biracial board, consisting of four Whites and three Blacks, is unanimous in it's belief that there can be no elimination of Black and White schools, absent assignment of pupils across existing lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.321" offset="6096645">I would like to capsule four aspects of this case underlying this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.498" offset="6125380">A brief word on the constitutional violation, discussion of the precise issue, a more detailed review of the evidence which shows the lack of sanctity in these school division lines and finally key aspects of the particular relief decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.753" offset="6218376">Coming to the constitutional violation, the mere fact that a dual school system was still flourishing in Richmond, 16 years after Brown, provides the nexus for the relief decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.388" offset="6276890">The only question confronting the District Court from the first day of the reopening of this protracted litigation was how to remedy this persistent and deliberately deferred perpetuation of a dual school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.725" offset="6350242">This is a remedy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.815" offset="6358601">We do not have to search for a constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.977" offset="6379290">This search for an effective remedy provides the lens through which all of the evidence and all of the actions of the District Court must be viewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.993" offset="6435297">The precise issue is rather narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.892" offset="6454941">If the District Court abused its discretion in approving a Richmond School Board desegregation plan, which involved assignments of pupils across these lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.209" offset="6512201">This concept of inter-divisional assignments constituted the essential ingredient in both of the alternative forms of relief sought, consolidation was not the only relief sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.100" offset="6579806">The first was a contractual interchange between the existing school divisions fully authorized by State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.118" offset="6619826">The second was a consolidation of these school divisions in accordance with the provisions of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.527" offset="6653471">Our position is that the action of the lower court was dictated on this record by a sound application of the all too familiar remedial guidelines previously established by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.343" offset="6720763">Under these decisions, there is only one test, that's effectiveness, effectiveness is the key.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.492" offset="6761305">No one can stand before the Bar of this Court and argue that the Richmond School Board plan is not obviously more effective than the present plans in operation in Richmond or Henrico or Chesterfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.720" offset="6834239">The respondents and the government has studiously avoided any discussion of effectiveness which we as understand it is the heart of Brown, Green, Swann, Davis and other decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.632" offset="6905919">The District Court, let me go back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.726" offset="6922324">What we analyzed is the position of the respondents' to be and the government apparently is it not withstanding these guidelines which are so clear and explicit, regardless of consequences, regardless of the feasibility of the means to overcome these lines, regardless of the past treatment of these lines by the State of Virgina, these lines impose a geographical limitation on the powers of a Chancellor seeking to remedy an admitted constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.737" offset="7102360">The District Court very carefully considered the importance which state authorities, local authorities had attached to these lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.396" offset="7152933">He concluded that there was no overriding state interest in either restricting the assignment of pupils to the political subdivision in which they reside or in requiring each political subdivision to operate it's own school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.706" offset="7238196">He also concluded from a review of all of the facts, that these lines did constitute barriers to any effective relief for these plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.117" offset="7287829">Now what evidence supports these findings?</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.173" offset="7300054">It falls into three areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.780" offset="7310503">First we don't have to look for, we simply only have to go to the Code of Virgina, the state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.524" offset="7341432">We next can go to the expressed policies of the State Board of Education, the father, we are a child in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.162" offset="7384064">The power over schools is in the State, this is a State violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.874" offset="7402872">Richmond did not of its own initiative set up a dual school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.756" offset="7426382">We can go to the established policies of the board and finally we can go to the history of past practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.924" offset="7447071">Let's come to the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.672" offset="7458043">Our Code expressly for many years has set out a framework for the operation of a school division consisting of two or more separate and distinct political sub-divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.833" offset="7530663">Our State law for years and we have all used it, has expressly provided for the operation of joint schools for any educational need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.192" offset="7584162">Our State law, and we have all engaged in it, not all, but many divisions have specifically provides for the contractual interchange of pupils between separate political sub-divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.771" offset="7650408">These, the very existence of these laws totally belongs any overriding State interest in restricting the assignment of pupils to the political sub-division in which they live, but they even do something else under the remedial guidelines of this Court, a fair interpretation of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.977" offset="7743300">They suggested alternatives which a District Court in the performance of his duty to end segregation and its effects had to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.937" offset="7795127">Let's come to State Board policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.556" offset="7809546">The State Board of Education has encouraged consolidations of separate political sub-divisions into one school division for almost 30 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2147.924" offset="8695097">Let's come to the past practices of these with respect to these lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.052" offset="8715577">The District Court quite popularly found that the State officials and local officials had historically used principles of consolidation and inter-divisional assignment of pupils in the establishment and maintenance of regional schools for Blacks, joint schools for Blacks and joint schools for other educational needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.669" offset="8834069">These regional schools for Blacks consisted of as many as four separate political subdivisions, encompassing an area as large as 1700 square miles, requiring the children to spend the night at these schools because of the extreme travel distances involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.568" offset="8941693">These schools operated in Virgina and the last one didn't close as this Court might have anticipated in 1955, it closed in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.163" offset="8987982">There is a not a scintilla of evidence in this record that any finance problems arose as a result of one regional school being supported by four, as many as four or five separate political sub-divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.595" offset="9069798">Now what about the use of inter-divisional assignments?</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.007" offset="9087352">There is a statute on our books, it's still on the books, Section 22, 115 found on our brief but also in the petition appendix at 194 which in 1960, the State declared it a matter of public policy of the State to encourage students to participate in programs which would require them to attend schools in political sub-divisions other than the one in which they reside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.187" offset="9224129">The more significant in order to perpetuate segregation, not pre-Brown, but after Brown the 50s, the late 60s, thousands of Blacks were involuntarily shoved across these so-called sacred lines for the sole purpose of perpetuating segregation in defiance of this Court and in defiance of the affirmative duty on school authorities to end discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.628" offset="9369893">Now is this all history, what's happening today?</text>

            <text syncTime="2353.832" offset="9518686">Kennedy High School, the Blacks in Richmond historically and today live in the Eastern portion of the city to South central portion, this is the black part of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.459" offset="9573230">The lily white area is in the Western part and part of the Southern. Kennedy High School right here, is a Richmond school opened in 1967.</text>

            <text syncTime="2437.214" offset="9852217">Each day of their lives they cross the line to go to school, they probably cross the line several times during the day, during the school because the line goes right through the school building.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.637" offset="9897880">So far as crossing lines in the past, as recently as 1969, Henrico was operating this school right up here in the extreme northern parts of the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.201" offset="9948139">They do claim to be lovers of neighborhood schools, have a neighborhood school for this school consisting of the entire Henrico County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.944" offset="9995160">Students from the eastern most portion of Henrico to get to that school, had to go into the city across this great line through the city outside the line again, up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.318" offset="10052629">That's how sacred the lines were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.132" offset="10063914">At the present time, Henrico, Richmond, Chesterfield, operate joint schools for educational needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.092" offset="10099754">The location of the Maths Science Center referred to by Mr. Coleman is right here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.256" offset="10120443">The school for -- I beg your pardon this school right here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.920" offset="10139042">In 1970-1971 approximately, it varies within the 1000 or 1500, approximately 10,000 students from Henrico attended some courses there, 10,000 from Chesterfield, 10,000 from Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.462" offset="10197243">So that's what significance the line has for us in Richmond today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.489" offset="10213334">I submit the Richmond School Board in light of its ignoring these lines in the past for educational purposes could not stand up here if it is so desired and interpose this line as a shield to effective relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.498" offset="10285328">I think that on the basis of the State laws, the State Board policies, of the past treatment of these lines, what else could a chancellor conclude that he was entitled to use certainly at the very least, the same means that were used to violate the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.776" offset="10398490">I fail to see where that is a drastic decision on the part of a person seeking to remedy a constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.497" offset="10433390">One other thing on the map I would point out, the Henrico offices are located right in the heart of the city.</text>

            <text syncTime="2711.145" offset="10948002">There is a detailed framework set out in State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.264" offset="10960436">All it requires is a request.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.524" offset="10969422">The State Board has to approve the request and the counties have to consent to it, but once the consent is there the machinery is already in our law to set it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.537" offset="11017488">But coming back to the plan, the only reason it was the only plan before the court, was that despite invitations from the court and from the Richmond School Board, none the respondents would participate in the preparation of a plan even assuming this relief were appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.174" offset="11084048">The lower court in its order of January the 10th expressly provided and gave them an abiding opportunity to come in and make amendments to the plan, modify the plan, even at this stage or they come up with a better plan so long as it eliminates segregation and effects, there will be no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.598" offset="11181746">Now, one of the point on the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.163" offset="11191986">There is no more racial balance created under this plan, in the plan approved by this Court in Swann and Mecklenburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.701" offset="11230124">Under the plan in Swann, the variance in black composition range from 8% to 38.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.437" offset="11257083">Under the Richmond School Board plan here it ranges from 17-41% black.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.521" offset="11285504">It is true that every schools ends up majority white, just like it did in Swann and Mecklenburg, simply because of the historically stable racial composition which has not varied one-tenth of 1% in a decade in Richmond, in the Richmond Metropolitan area, of two-thirds white, one third black.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.603" offset="11369827">This Court in McDaniel versus Barresi by approving that plan for the Clark Country, certainly approved to plan which does a lot more toward racial balance than either this plan contemplates or results in or was done in Swann.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.628" offset="11433880">Furthermore I call the Court's attention to the caveat of the District Court found on the white petitioner appendix, Volume II, page 519 and 520, where the court itself said, “whereas the racial composition is educationally sound there is no constitutional requirement for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.504" offset="11505351">It's not to be deemed inflexible.</text>

            <text syncTime="2863.882" offset="11558849">In concluding then, may it please the Court, on this record, the acceptance of inter-divisional assignments is certainly not too broad a remedial device.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.916" offset="11603048">It has inherent limitations, namely time and distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.369" offset="11620812">The only time where inter-divisional assignments would be an appropriate remedial tool would be whereas here the transportation times and distances are remarkably comparable to what is presently being carried out in each of the separate divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.892" offset="11702941">In conclusion, I think the bald truth is shown by this map.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.531" offset="11733452">We have 67-68, 60% blacks school right now in Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.908" offset="11754977">This is based on 1971, 1972 figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.171" offset="11772008">Look what's right next door, seven-tenths of 1% black, three-tenths of 1% black, 0% black and the greatest percentage of black in any of the schools shown here is 5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.075" offset="11831672">That is our problem and if this Court affirms the Fourth Circuit, you have the stark reality of black and white schools in the face of a feasible alternative for eliminating and finally if it affirms the Fourth Circuit, I think it is all too clear from a particular standpoint, that the promises of Brown would be rendered illusory for every black child in the city of Richmond.</text>

            <text syncTime="2972.043" offset="11991542">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.433" offset="12013066">We respectfully submit that the question on this case is not whether the Richmond School system is desegregated, it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.588" offset="12045772">There are no children included or excluded from any Richmond School on the basis of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.466" offset="12077223">The question in this case is not whether the Richmond School system is unitary, it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.099" offset="12103764">There is no school in the Richmond School that is racially identifiable as white or black, they are just schools in Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.557" offset="12137618">The question in this case is whether the constitution requires that a desegregated unitary city school system which has a substantial black majority, be consolidated with two other independent desegregated unitary county school systems in order to assure a white student majority in the city schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.984" offset="12239287">The fundamental facts here are just three.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.933" offset="12255065">The Richmond School System has a substantial black majority, the county school systems have a substantial white majority and the District Court plan and that is what is in question here, the plan entered by the District Court in this case is under review here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.841" offset="12330715">The District Court plan in question would create a single consolidated system so that students would attend schools with substantial white majorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.393" offset="12376900">The issue is here then of whether a ratio of seven black students to three white students in the unitary school system is constitutionally forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.860" offset="12422771">Whether a ratio of seven white students to three black students is constitutionally compelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.318" offset="12456626">With Court's permission, I shall address myself first to some of the facts, second to the applicable precedence, third to the question of the existence of a constitutional violation and finally to the problem of a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.731" offset="12522245">This action was not one initiated against the counties of Henrico or Chesterfield, desegregate their school systems because those school systems are and were before they were brought into this case desegregated and unitary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3510.077" offset="14143718">This case came -- this issue came in 1970, after if I may say so.</text>

            <text syncTime="3521.691" offset="14190111">This school system or free school systems were already under audit and were already desegregated and unitary and what the Court of Appeals found Your Honor was that there was an absence of a nexus, what had been done in the past, if we conceive, abominate is not because of the distribution, population distribution which we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.813" offset="14306617">As I say this case originated as an action to desegregate the Richmond School system, the respondents were not made parties to the action until after the Richmond School System came under a decree to desegregate in accordance with this Court's mandate in Green and the School Board of New Kent County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.833" offset="14390732">It was only after the District Court decreed and effected a unitary plan for Richmond, that Richmond proposed, the plaintiffs embraced and the Trial Court adopted, consolidation plan called on a respondent counties to provide students of the Richmond school system to assure a substantial white majority in every Richmond school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.840" offset="14490728">The consolidation plan approved by the Trial Court which is the plan under review here would assure that no school in the consolidated system would have a student body of less than 60% or more than 80% white.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.651" offset="14549974">This plan has no function or effect other than to assure this specific racial balance which petitioners experts have labeled a “Viable racial mix.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3634.157" offset="14640044">Each had approximately the same wealth and tax base for pupil for educational financing except that Richmond afforded a slightly larger wealth and tax base than either of the two counties.</text>

            <text syncTime="3902.055" offset="15711587">It's quite true that the petitioners have run away from the factual record on which this case and the judgment was based.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.545" offset="15761533">They say the plan ordered the separation of the school systems from their county and city tax basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.109" offset="15791835">It ordered the evolution of the County in city school boards and their replacement for a court created school board with a consequent dilution of the control of local education by local parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.254" offset="15840423">It ordered the replacement of an already large fully equipped school system or three already large fully equipped school systems by a single school of system, so large as to be in the top 0.2% of American school systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3950.086" offset="15903744">And it did this and this is my point, it did this all solely for the effect of assuring white majorities in the classrooms of Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.794" offset="15950555">The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that this restructuring of local government for this purpose was beyond the power of Federal courts and we respectfully submit that the judgment below should be affirmed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.415" offset="16004995">The case for the respondents rests on three propositions established by this Court in four of its most recent rulings on the subject of school desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.346" offset="16040730">All of these decisions support the conclusion of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3988.776" offset="16058493">Judgment of affirmance by this Court, may rest on anyone of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.657" offset="16078033">All of these precedents would have to be rejected, I submit if the judgment of Court of Appeals is to be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.315" offset="16104678">The first of the rules established by this Court on which respondents rely that the function of Judicial school desegregation decrees is to transform a dual system into a unitary school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4014.371" offset="16160893">This was a rule established in Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.597" offset="16173746">It should be noted that the New Kent County school system involved in Green like the Richmond school system is a black majority school system adjacent to a white majority school system and was such at the time this Court ordered the creation of a unitary system within New Kent County.</text>
            <text syncTime="4037.761" offset="16254412">Command of Green was accomplished by the Trial Court in this case and it approved both of the plans proffered by the Plaintiffs and by Richmond to effect a unitary school system in Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.555" offset="16309582">Under the plans approved by the Trial Court, one of which has been in effect in Richmond for the past two school years, each of the schools in Richmond appropriately reflects the racial composition of the school population of the entire system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.854" offset="16382830">School system of Richmond therefore I submit is unitary in accordance with the requirement of Green and that is what this Court has said in recent cases, that is what the constitution requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.359" offset="16436851">Until a decision by the Trial Court below, there had not been a single decision that went beyond the requirement of creating a unitary school system out of a dual school system, except where school system boundaries had been drawn with the effect of perpetuating a dual system or preventing its conversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4106.969" offset="16531205">The second rule on which respondents rely was established by this Court in Swann and Charlotte-Mecklenburg and it held that the establishment of a racial balance among schools, even within a single system, was not a constitutional duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4123.952" offset="16599228">Indeed, the Court said in Swann that the use of a racial balance, other than as a starting point for a plan to restructure a dual system was judicially improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="4135.700" offset="16646144">And it said that once the unitary system had been established, as is the case here, the Federal Court had fulfilled its constitutional function and should go no further, even in the face of later demographic changes, not attributable to invidious governmental action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4153.381" offset="16716884">In the instant case, the whole purpose and effect of the consolidation plan is to established a racial balance and need not look only at the allegations of the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4169.140" offset="16779891">The petitioners summary of their plan is set forth in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.982" offset="16803297">The petitioners testimony in support of the plan is set forth in our brief and if you look pages 18 to 30 of our brief, you will see that a viable racial mix was the objective of this plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4187.849" offset="16854810">I call it racial balance, but here the viable racial mix was defined for the District Court as the one in which there are not less than 20%, no more than 40% black students in every school in the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4202.785" offset="16914474">I submit that the consolidation plan accomplishes nothing else in the effectuation of this viable racial mix.</text>
            <text syncTime="4213.258" offset="16956374">The third case on which we right of the the City Council of Employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4219.388" offset="16980929">In that case both the majority and the minority were agreed that racial balance was a proper objective of the school desegregation decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="4228.778" offset="17018441">Majority ruled the school system boundaries could not be redrawn where the effect of such action would be to leave black pupils in inferior schools and inhibit the effectuation of the unitary system theretofore ordered by the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.690" offset="17082180">Parenthetically it should be noted that the single school system, that the court left in the Employer case at a racial balance approximately the same as that which exists in Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="4256.655" offset="17130036">It's clear, I submit from Employer that it was the invidious effect of the manipulation of school system boundaries that permitted the Trial Court to enjoin the separation of the newly created city school system from the county system, of which it had been so long required.</text>
            <text syncTime="4272.107" offset="17191790">In this case there is no possibility of charging a school system boundaries as ancient as these, coterminous as they are with the county and city governments of which they are part and on which they depend, were anyway created or manipulated with the effect of preventing the creation of a unitary system in Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="4291.847" offset="17270784">But it is only when such gerrymandering is occurred that the court has sustained the power of the federal judiciary to interfere with the allocation of functions to municipal governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4302.500" offset="17313416">Point underlined by both the majority and dissent in Employer was a constitutional right to local control of educational systems, except only where that allocation of authority was a means to preclude the establishment of the unitary system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4321.790" offset="17390529">The fourth of the cases, before I leave that point, there is an incident of local control which I think is not irrelevant, which is particularly pointed out by the brief of – the amicus brief that by CORE, that not only will the consolidation remove, destroy local control of the counties and the governments, in effect will dilute the black influence that has become existent in the Richmond area, where they now have three of the seven members of the school board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.446" offset="17513200">The fourth of the cases that I submit is controlling here is Spencer and Kugler, Where this Court affirmed the proposition that school system boundaries that were patterned on the boundaries of local government units, of which the school systems here are an integral part, are not subject to revision by a federal court in order to establish a better racial mix among the separate and distinct school systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="4379.404" offset="17621034">Here as Spencer there is a demographic pattern that shows a concentration of black population within certain school systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="4387.005" offset="17651440">Here as in Spencer there is no showing that the demographic pattens are in any way a consequence of governmental actions to effectuate the separation of the races.</text>
            <text syncTime="4397.219" offset="17692296">The fact is, insofar as the demography of the Richmond area is concerned, the racial pattern is similar to that of all city/suburban areas in the United States, north, south, east and west, except that the immigration of blacks to the city into Richmond, is smaller than most of such areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4418.802" offset="17778604">I submit that the decision of the Court of Appeals under review here is consistent with and indeed required by in each of the precedents established by this Court in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4430.396" offset="17824998">What petitioners seek here is a major departure from this Court's precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4436.933" offset="17851120">If petitioners are to succeed here, it can only be because Black majority school systems are unconstitutional per se, where such a school system is adjacent to a white majority school system, although both school systems are in compliance with the constitutional commands of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4455.939" offset="17927084">The only alleged deficiency, the only alleged deficiency of the Richmond system is that it has a black majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4463.445" offset="17957177">The notion of the intrinsic inferiority of school systems with black majorities as asserted by petitioner's expert witnesses is for the reasons, so cogently set forth in Judge Sobeloff's opinion in the Brunson case basically inconsistent with the ruling of this Court in Brown v. Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="4483.576" offset="18037635">The other unwarranted innovation which petitioners would bring about is a duty of the federal courts to restructure local government in order to bring the different racial mixes that exists within cities and outside cities under a single governmental unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4499.996" offset="18103359">Insofar as petitioner's claim rests on the concentration of blacks within cities and the concentration of whites outside cities, a nationwide phenomenon as a reason for joining the school systems its arguendo is equally valid or invalid with regard to every governmental function performed by local government units.</text>
            <text syncTime="4522.177" offset="18192071">The general problem in metropolitan government where the existing cities and suburbs can continue to exist as separate jurisdictions or must be combined in some metropolitan unit is a most complicated, political, social and economic problem which has many aspects other than schools, but which is not and cannot be the concern of the judiciary in our system of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4554.310" offset="18320593">I'll turn if I may to the question of a existence of a constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4561.064" offset="18347656">As this Court reiterated in Swann, before a federal court may intervene to substitute its authority for that of a local government, there must have been a constitutional violation committed by that local government and the federal court's action must be directed to a cure of that violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4581.561" offset="18429576">Respondents here are not guilty of any such constitutional violation, so the necessary predicate for federal court action is lacking.</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.405" offset="18468968">What the petitioners have shown is only there is a concentration of blacks in the urban population of the Richmond area, the concentration of whites in the surrounding areas, but there is and could be no showing that the respondents are in any way responsible for bringing about that racial distribution.</text>

            <text syncTime="5258.318" offset="21136593">In fact both the majority and the minority of in Employer, found such great consequence and the importance of which was underscored by this Court's recent decision in the Texas School Financing cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.143" offset="21219976">I would submit, that if this plan were to be approved by this Court, the resulting rule would require a reorganization of every urban and suburban school district in the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5294.769" offset="21282461">By changing their boundaries and removing their systems from local control, demographic patterns existent here and that is the basis for the petitioner's case are nationwide and not local.</text>
            <text syncTime="5309.382" offset="21340871">And if we look only at the areas adjacent to Henrico and Chesterfield County, the map in the back of our brief, you will see that the District Court were to adopt petitioner's thesis, there could be a proper demand on the same two counties, to supply their white students not only to Richmond, but to the counties of Charles City, Dinwiddie, Amelia, Goochland, and New Kent as well as the City of Petersburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="5337.857" offset="21454764">We submit that such a vast overhauling of the school system of the nation, will not have happy result in the maintenance of public schooling.</text>
            <text syncTime="5348.407" offset="21496978">I have said Mr. Justice White, that busing is not an appropriate means under the circumstances described in Swann for the effectuation of the unitary system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5357.226" offset="21532296">It is not irrelevant of the busing involved here, it's totally segregated busing.</text>

            <text syncTime="5369.060" offset="21579630">We submit that is not likely to help solve conflict -- the ratio of conflict that's existent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5377.067" offset="21611604">The children of Richmond, Chesterfield and Henrico would be selected by, addressed like lottery.</text>
            <text syncTime="5383.636" offset="21637935">The distances to be traversed and the time to be invested are necessarily greater than under the existing programs.</text>

            <text syncTime="5397.234" offset="21692270">The proposed consolidated system would covers 752 square miles and since busing would be to and from the city of Richmond, distances must necessarily be great.</text>
            <text syncTime="5410.411" offset="21745037">We submit in short that the proposed cure would be far more deleterious than the alleged disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="5417.518" offset="21773458">As this Court indicated in Employer, It would not support even an intra-system plan whose consequences would be egregious, they certainly are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5429.359" offset="21820792">In sum the case presents a simple, but important question whether the constitution requires, that wherever there is a demographic pattern of racial separation, school systems must be restructured by federal courts to assure the presence of white student majorities wherever possible</text>
            <text syncTime="5447.909" offset="21894980">.This Court has already announced that racial balance within a school system is an objective beyond the scope of the federal judicial function.</text>
            <text syncTime="5455.747" offset="21926327">A fortiori I submit it is beyond the scope of federal judicial power to impose racial balance among independent unitary school systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="5466.042" offset="21967496">Teaching of Brown id the Court please, and the judgments that have been founded upon it, is not that there must be a racial balance, but rather that the races should have equal status.</text>
            <text syncTime="5479.980" offset="22023293">We respectfully submit that the Trial Court's judgment would detract rather than add to this equality of status.</text>
            <text syncTime="5488.949" offset="22059133">We pray that the judgment of the Court of the Appeals for the Fourth Circuit be affirmed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="5510.271" offset="22144502">May it please the Court, this case is an inevitable sequel to the decisions in Brown I and II that we have got this far is I think a sign of progress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5528.441" offset="22217122">The only constitutional provision which is applicable here is the clause in the Fourteenth Amendment which says that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="5544.059" offset="22279607">There is nothing in the constitution about education, about quality education, about racial balance or racial mix.</text>
            <text syncTime="5555.658" offset="22326000">The problem in the Brown cases clearly arose because of the maintenance of dual school systems, where children were assigned to one school or another in the same school district because of their race.</text>
            <text syncTime="5571.246" offset="22388381">That was what was attacked there and no greater relief was there claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5578.527" offset="22417429">Here there is no dual school system in Richmond under Plan III now in operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5587.078" offset="22451702">Whether in the absence of a dual school system or it's vestiges in Richmond, the equal protection cause as an any application is the issue now presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5600.823" offset="22506663">Before I proceed further I would like to refer to certain phrases which I used in the brief for the petitioners in 72-550, sometimes taken from the opinion of the District Court below because I believe that they are or can be misleading or an unintentional hindrance to thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="5625.301" offset="22604570">For example on pages 44 and 46 of the brief, the words “greatest possible degree of desegregation” appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="5637.365" offset="22652844">Now this is an attractive phrase, but I think that standing alone it has no real meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="5645.129" offset="22683878">It takes on meaning only as it is applied to a specific group of students attending schools in a defined area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5655.819" offset="22726614">It has meaning as applied to the students in the City of Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="5660.465" offset="22745213">It has meaning as applied to students attending schools in a larger area, but it does not help them in the task presented here which is to determine whether the process by which a dual school system is effectively disestablished, can be extended to a larger area not for the purpose of eliminating dual schools, but for the purpose of providing a viable racial mix.</text>
            <text syncTime="5692.305" offset="22872586">Another phrase which appears several times in the brief to which I have referred and in the District Court opinion is “racially identifiable schools.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5705.463" offset="22925249">Again I suggest that this phrase has no operational meaning except as it is applied to a particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5715.200" offset="22964224">There are many schools in Vermont and New Hampshire and other states which are a 100% white and thus I suppose they are racially identifiable, but they do not in any sense violate any provision of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5730.914" offset="23027022">It is only when a school is racially identifiable with respect to something else that the phrase has any legal significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5739.882" offset="23062862">On this record, there are no schools which are racially identifiable with respect to any other school in the City of Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="5748.383" offset="23096926">A school is not racially identifiable for any purpose of legal significance merely because it is 70% white or 70% black or indeed 100% white or 100% black and I doubt that that presents any question under the equal protection clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5769.554" offset="23181563">Indeed there is something, somewhat contradictory and unattractive in the proposition that a school is inferior merely because it has a certain percentage of black students.</text>
            <text syncTime="5783.764" offset="23238405">Unless the proportion of students of one race in a school is the consequence of some sort of invidious discrimination or unless it leads to discrimination through inequality of appropriations, it should be colorless legally.</text>
            <text syncTime="5800.961" offset="23307264">Here is the place where the constitution should be color blind.</text>
            <text syncTime="5806.639" offset="23329938">Yet the record shows that it was this sort of reasoning which led the District Courts to its conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5815.028" offset="23363480">The District Court's order is based on a concept of a viable racial mix, a phrase that is used many times in its order and which comes directly from the testimony in the District Court of Dr Little and Dr. Pettigrove (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="5831.818" offset="23430666">This approach has already been judicially answered in one of the characteristically illuminating opinions of Judge Sobeloff in the Brunson case which is quoted at pages 59 and 60 or the respondent's brief, the notion that a good school must have a white majority, thus as Judge Sobeloff said seem to constitute a direct attack on the roots of the Brown decision, yet that is the only basis of the District Court's order.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="5953.458" offset="23917171">Mr. Justice I think the testimony of the experts if examined will show that in their opinion in any situation in which there are 2 or 3 or 4% black students that that is undesirable for the black students and that in any situation in which there are 50%, 60%, 70% black students that there is a great potentiality of white flight.</text>
            <text syncTime="5975.128" offset="24003897">And here the children of Chesterfield and Henrico counties are brought into the picture for the purpose of maintaining this not less that 20 and not more than 40% of the black, and yet why stop there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5991.713" offset="24070248">As the map of the close of the respondent's brief shows these three areas are completely surrounded by other counties where there is a majority of black.</text>
            <text syncTime="6003.445" offset="24117164">Now, why shouldn't some of the Chesterfield and Henrico students, perhaps those living close by, be used to liven the mix in the surrounding territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="6013.776" offset="24158438">Indeed this is just a way to test the District Court's decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="6018.899" offset="24178918">This case began in Richmond and the remedy is designed to improve the situation in Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="6025.474" offset="24205249">Let us suppose though that the case had been started in Chesterfield County and complaint had been made that the schools in Chesterfield are racially identifiable, and that a mix of 20% to 40% black students is preferable, according to the expert testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="6042.476" offset="24273272">Thus it seemed conceivable that an order would then have been made joining Richmond as a party defended in the Chesterfield case, and then bringing Richmond students into Chesterfield in order to provide there a viable racial mix.</text>
            <text syncTime="6057.613" offset="24333876">It may be suggested that this is absurd, but I wonder if it is really different from what the District Court undertook to do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6067.061" offset="24371597">And in this connection I would like to refer to a few undisputed facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6073.146" offset="24395943">The combined area of Richmond, Chesterfield and Henrico is 752 square miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="6080.702" offset="24426141">That is more 10 times the area of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="6085.326" offset="24444635">It is 63% of the area of the State of Rhode Island and nearly 37% of the area of the State of Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="6093.469" offset="24477236">The petitioner's arguments here inevitably lead to a large amount of centralization and concentration of control over these schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="6103.753" offset="24518405">And logically, there is no reason for stopping short of a statewide system.</text>
            <text syncTime="6109.426" offset="24541080">Indeed, since the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment embraces the concept of the Equal Protection Clause, there is no logical reason for stopping short of a single national school system with a viable racial mix in every school.</text>
            <text syncTime="6124.376" offset="24600848">This is very close to the problem with which this Court dealt in the San Antonio School District case, where it concluded that the Equal Protection Clause should not be applied so mechanically to produce a type of overall inflexible egalitarianism, which is indeed alien to our history, and to our institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6148.720" offset="24698232">Our position here is not quite as broad as that taken by the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="6154.516" offset="24721429">We do not contend that school district lines are inevitably or inherently inviable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6161.075" offset="24747656">On the contrary, in the Scotland Neck and in the Emporia cases last term, we contended that district line should be disregarded when they were established, or put into effective use where the purpose of maintaining the consequences of a once combined and segregated school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="6179.625" offset="24821844">But there are no such facts here, and there is no contention here that these district boundaries were invidiously established.</text>
            <text syncTime="6187.645" offset="24853922">If there had been specific instances when the lines have been used to maintain segregation, and that effect continues then we would regard the district lines, the District Court as having power to look into that situation and to devise an appropriate remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="7056.828" offset="28330715">But you had pointed out to you that it was a biracial school board that made the determination to seek this relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="7063.317" offset="28356629">Secondly you had pointed out to you that a black a petitioner asking this relief and I really think it comes with poor grace from the Commonwealth of Virginia that has this tremendous history of segregation and penning black people out to now say that somehow we are criticized for attempting to get schools which comply with the constitution, that's all we want, and not to have schools which are in violation of the constitution.</text>
