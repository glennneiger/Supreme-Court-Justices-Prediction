            <label>Mr. Edward R. Korman</label>
            <text syncTime="33.114" offset="235813">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.070" offset="247620">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to review a five to four en banc decision of that court which held that under the Sixth Amendment, a defendant in criminal case is entitled to the presence of counsel at a pretrial showing of photographs to witnesses to the crime of which he is accused of committing.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.105" offset="339780">This case arises out of an armed bank robbery of branch office of the American Security and Trust Company in the District of Columbia on the 25th day of August, 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.198" offset="388159">A lone gunman entered the bank and he now put a stocking mask over a portion of his face, announced his intentions and told everyone not to move.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.833" offset="426715">Immediately thereafter, a second man entered the bank, ran behind the Teller’s cages, scooped up the money and run out of the bank followed by the gunman who had initially entered the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.500" offset="473422">As the bandits ran from the bank they again removed the stocking masks which covered their faces up to the bottom of their noses and at this point they were both seen with their faces uncovered by a woman who was seated in a car outside of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.987" offset="539355">The two robbers, however, made good their escape and it was not until some five months after the robbery had occurred that a convicted felon concededly seeking consideration from the authorities told them that one Charles Ash had asked him, the informant, to participate in the bank robbery and had on the day following the robbery admitted his participation to the informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.368" offset="644890">On the basis of this information police gathered five photographs, one each of the defendant Ash, one of Bailey who is accomplice which the informant had told the authorities, Ash had implicated as the second man in the robbery and three other photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.036" offset="723466">These are all black and white and they were shown to four witnesses to that robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.002" offset="743424">Two of them were bank tellers and both of them selected photographs of Ash as the gunman.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.210" offset="776234">Neither was positive in their identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.796" offset="790549">The third witness who was shown these photographs was a customer at the bank who had seen the gunman enter the bank and put the mask on.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.473" offset="829315">He also selected the photograph of Ash, his identification was likewise inconclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.124" offset="855855">The fourth witness was the woman who had seen the two running from the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.134" offset="871946">She also picked out a photograph of Ash as being one of the two whom she had seen running from the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.816" offset="898591">Her identification was likewise uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.401" offset="925027">The case for a number of reasons was not scheduled for trial until May 8, 1965 some two-and-half years after the showing of the initial photographs and some three years, almost three years after the date that the crime was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.274" offset="996498">The Assistant United States Attorney in charge of the case, no doubt wondering whether any of the eyewitnesses would be able to make any kind of identification at this stage of the proceeding, had five color photographs displayed to each of the four witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.991" offset="1059297">The five photographs included one each of Bailey, one of Ash and three others.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.471" offset="1093256">The two defendants --</text>

            <text syncTime="250.369" offset="1104854">Unconnected with the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.186" offset="1124080">The two photographs of the perspective of the defendants who would go on trial the following day, what is known as I believe called “full length FBI case photographs” indicating their height and their build.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.347" offset="1180714">The three other photographs were not full length, but were cut at some point above and below the chest.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.790" offset="1210493">At this point the results of the photograph at display were again inconclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.447" offset="1233168">Three of the witnesses picked out Ash’s photograph and said that he looked like him or words to that effect, their identification was uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.300" offset="1272560">A fourth witness the gentleman who was a customer at the bank could not pick out any photograph.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.688" offset="1298160">Again, as in the first instance none of the witnesses were able to pick out the photograph of the codefendant Bailey.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.225" offset="1332224">The District Court after a hearing, pretrial hearing, held that the initial photographic at display which took place five months after the robbery, was not impermissibly suggestive and that regardless of the propriety of the second showing of photographs, there was an independent basis for the uncertainty at that point eyewitness identifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.724" offset="1430235">At the trial the government introduced the testimony of its informant who under oath testified that Ash had asked him to participate in the robbery and that the day following the robbery Ash had admitted his part of participation to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.121" offset="1499826">The government also introduced the testimony of the four eyewitnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.459" offset="1521246">Three of them again made inconclusive identifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.134" offset="1535875">They were not positive of their identification of Ash, nearly picking him out as looking like or words to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.389" offset="1568893">The fourth woman who was seated on the car who had of all the witnesses perhaps of greatest opportunity to view the bandits unmasked picked out both Ash and Bailey positively.</text>

            <text syncTime="379.091" offset="1619780">Mr. Korman this trial took place in May of 1968?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_r_korman" startTime="381.478" stopTime="993.843">
            <label>Mr. Edward R. Korman</label>
            <text syncTime="381.478" offset="1629288">That’s correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.348" offset="1640782">Again, none of the witnesses, none of the other three witnesses where able to select Bailey at all as even looking like the person that had -- the second person that had been involved in the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.909" offset="1686967">The prosecution during its case did not elicit the fact that there had been any pretrial identification from photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.790" offset="1718523">Bailey’s counsel, however, was anxious to show that Mrs. Apple who had made a positive identification of Bailey in the courtroom had been on unable the day before the pick is photograph out of the five that we shown to her and so during the defense case, he called the FBI agent, then Mrs. Bailey to elicit the fact that one, she had indeed been shown photographs, she had picked out one person as being one of the two she had seen running from the bank, but was on able to pick out the photograph of Bailey and he then offered the photograph of Bailey into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.517" offset="1861465">At this point the United States Attorney asked that Ash’s photograph be offered into evidence presumably lest the jury get the impression that the other person she has picked out was someone other than Ash.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.812" offset="1906604">Ultimately all five photographs were admitted and the jury thus became aware that Mrs. Apple had made an uncertain identification of Ash’s photograph on the day before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.038" offset="1959476">The jury was unable to reach a verdict as to Bailey.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.345" offset="1972746">As to him the only evidence was the positive identification of the witness in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.949" offset="1995212">The jury was hung and after the trial, the judge directed a verdict of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.481" offset="2013288">The defendant Ash, however, was convicted of all counts of the indictment arising out of the armed bank robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.581" offset="2041710">On appeal, the Court of Appeals did not reach the issue of whether the second pretrial photographic display was improperly suggestive.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.423" offset="2077027">The majority stated that certainly the elements of suggestiveness was strong enough so that it cannot be assumed there was no undue suggestiveness in the absence of explicit findings by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.687" offset="2126137">And of course the trial court had not reached this issue, but the majority in the Court of Appeals likewise stated that it was aware that there are indications of setting in part the inference of undue suggestiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.707" offset="2178173">Since these other indications were not conclusive and since that there were no explicit findings by the District Court on this issue, the majority held that remand would ordinarily be required, but for its conclusion that the defendant was entitled to counsel at the photographic display on the day before trial and that thus a reversible error was committed in the admission of the fact that Mrs.Apple had in fact made an identification albeit an uncertain one on the day prior to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.157" offset="2315995">We believe that this holding which is contrary to the holdings of nine other Circuit Courts of Appeals and the overwhelming majority of State Court is erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.497" offset="2353403">Accordingly we ask that the judgment be reversed and that the case be remanded for the further proceedings, suggested in the opinion of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.188" offset="2392168">The Court of Appeals rested its decision on majority of the five principally on the holding of this Court in United States against Wade that a defendant was entitled to counsel at forced confrontations between himself and the witness or victim of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.954" offset="2459146">In holding that an interview between a prosecutor and the witness at which the accused was not present, was like a lineup “at critical stage of the preceding,” the court, below we submit, ignored the critical and crucial distinctions between a lineup and photographic display.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.396" offset="2532916">The basis of this Court’s holding as we read Wade was that lineups were susceptible to many forms of subtle suggestion which increased the possibility of erroneous identification and not only were they susceptible to this kind of subtle suggestion, but because of the nature of the proceedings, it was impossible for a defendant to reconstruct them at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.718" offset="2630196">The reasons for the inability to reconstruct these events was peculiar to the nature of the tense emotional atmosphere that is involved on a victim or a witness to a crime is confronted with the person who was accused or perpetrating the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.629" offset="2689860">The possibility of subtle suggestion is present simply in the fact that it’s a live lineup, the defendant is asked to walk in to move about, to don clothing, to utter words.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.101" offset="2739806">They suggest that potential for suggestion has been suggested as present and everything from the clothing he wears to the matter in which the lights are focused on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.033" offset="2779512">Under these circumstances, given the inability to reconstruct these subtle forms of suggestion, it was held that a lawyer was present to enable the defendant at trial to confront the witnesses against him and to elicit before the jury or for the benefit of the court those elements which were improper in the conduct of the lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.420" offset="2869060">Photographic, the difference between what Judge Wilkey in his dissenting opinion called this little drama of the live confrontation and the showing of five or six still photographs to a witness or a victim is apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.059" offset="2931649">Initially there are just these five photographs, there is no defendant present.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.099" offset="2947741">He doesn’t move around.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.232" offset="2952338">He’s not asked to anything, he’s not asked to don any clothing, no lights are shown upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.675" offset="2978043">In addition, the photographs are generally shown in a much less emotionally charged atmosphere.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.331" offset="3000717">They are shown either in the office of the prosecutor or as in this case at the home or place of business of the witnesses to the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.237" offset="3036348">And then, while it’s true there is still a potential for suggestion, it is true that the photographs themselves may not be properly selected or in some other way, indicate to the witness who it is that the police think committed this offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.808" offset="3098624">But that kind of suggestion is readily shown simply by looking at the photographs at a suppression hearing and indeed in this case the defendant argued and the Court of Appeals was able to give a minute description of the suggestive influences that is found present simply on the basis of viewing the photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.632" offset="3185873">Now, this is not the same as simply taking a picture of the lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.060" offset="3203636">A picture of the lineup would just show what happened during that one split second when the picture was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.934" offset="3227146">It would not show what happen the minute after or a minute before so that this is not as the defendant suggests in his brief, the equivalent of taken a picture of a lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.038" offset="3275525">It is also true that there is a potential for suggestion in the words that maybe spoken to the witness when the photographs are shown, but that kind of suggestion; number one, can be revealed by the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.161" offset="3320038">There is no reason in the world why he should not be able to testify truthfully as to what was said to him when photographs were shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.348" offset="3352743">More significantly, there is no more potential for suggestion there than in an interview without any photographs at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.445" offset="3381164">After all if the prosecutor was so inclined, you could simply tell the witness, “Well, remember you gave us a description, you said one of them you said the gunman in this case was 19 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.706" offset="3430170">He was black, light skinned.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.774" offset="3438425">He was well dressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.831" offset="3442709">He was wearing glasses.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.359" offset="3452844">Well, you go into the courtroom and take a look and see if you see him at the defense table.”</text>
            <text syncTime="841.921" offset="3471026">Now, that’s the most apparent kind of suggestion which can take place without any kind of photographs being present.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.167" offset="3500074">Yet, it’s never been held nor as I understand has it ever been suggested that any time a prosecutor even talks with the witness to the crime that a lawyer is required to be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.246" offset="3552319">And so for these substantial reasons we think that this proceeding of showing of still photographs is significantly different and that this is not a critical stage of proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.135" offset="3603937">Also there is another significant fact that differentiates this case from the lineup case.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.081" offset="3631731">This is what transpires when a prosecutor talks with the witness is simply a preparation by the prosecutor of the witness for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.203" offset="3668198">We know of no case, one that is ever held that a defendant is entitled to a lawyer at a proceeding which he himself is not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.431" offset="3709053">Particularly this is so when the preceding is nothing more than an interview had between the witness and the prosecutor as part of his preparations for the trial of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.277" offset="3760462">And I think that it is significant not only the language of the opinion, the majority opinion in Wade which constantly stressed the forced confrontation between the accused and the witness to the offense, but also the concurring opinions of the justices who cast the deciding votes on the issue of whether a lineup was a critical stage of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.239" offset="3852309">Mr. Justice Black in concurring in that portion of the opinion of which this Court said that a lineup is a critical stage of the proceeding said “I agree with the court that a lineup is a critical stage of the criminal preceding against accused -- against an accused because it is a stage of which the government makes use of his custody to obtain crucial evidence against him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="960.025" offset="3943424">Mr. Justice Clark who cast the concurring vote in that case relied principally on Miranda versus Arizona as the basis for his concurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.310" offset="3988564">That case of course involved custodial interrogation of an accused who is in custody and so that that factor, the accused was present when this transpired and needed a lawyer to help him because of his very presence there, we regard to be one of the other crucial factors which distinguish this case from Wade.</text>

            <text syncTime="1077.202" offset="4412165">Given both the state of the law, the overwhelming majority of the cases which have decided this issue and it held that a lawyer is not present that it need not be present at the photographic display, the respondent has understandably relegated to second place in his brief the defense of the majority opinion of the Court of Appeals and instead he would have this Court decide this case on an issue which was not dealt with by the District Court, which the Court of Appeals felt was not properly presented, given this state of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.181" offset="4548106">That is that in effect the showing on the day before trial was so impermissibly suggestive as to constitute a violation of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.057" offset="4591574">As I’ve noted, the Court of Appeals and I think quite properly it was very careful in dealing with this issue and in stating that they could not and would not, absent specific findings by the District Court on this particular question rule on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.749" offset="4658343">I think this careful disposition was correct for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.394" offset="4680913">Number one, the constitution of course provides that all criminal trials shall be by jury in Article III, Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.556" offset="4713618">A finding that a particular photographic identification was so impermissibly suggestive as to constitute a violation of due process necessarily ousts from the jury its function of considering the reliability and credibility of this eyewitness identification, even whereas here all of the facts can be brought before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.622" offset="4805883">So that before a court reaches such a conclusion, before a court determines to oust from the jury its crucial fact finding function under the constitution, should be very careful to do so on a record that is complete on findings that are made by District Court and should not reach out and decide it on an inadequate record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.575" offset="4893654">Second is worth noting that in this case are the factors which the Court of Appeals eluded to which indicated the possibility that there was no such undue suggestion that would lead to a due process violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.816" offset="4946631">One, despite this alleged suggestion and we have to keep in mind that these photographs to the extent that they were suggestive were suggestive as to Bailey, as they were to Ash yet not a single witness was even able to pick out Bailey's photograph and even say so much that he looked like Bailey.</text>

            <text syncTime="1240.640" offset="5065958">In the second place even as to Ash, three of the witnesses on the day before trial were able to give only uncertain identifications and the fourth wasn’t even able to pick out his photograph.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.090" offset="5115695">So that and in addition because of the way the proceedings were handled, the pretrial hearing, none of the witnesses, all but one I should say, only one of the witnesses was even asked questions about the effect which the viewing of the photographs had on her the day before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.988" offset="5203362">And the third reason that I think ought to be considered before the Court deals with this is that this is really a factual issue that hasn’t been resolved by the two courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.246" offset="5244322">And at this stage we think it would be improper for this Court to reach out to decide the issue before any consideration was given to it by the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.604" offset="5281834">And in this respect I would call the Court's attention to an analogous case of United States against Foster which this Court concluded by a five to four vote that in fact the identification was impermissibly suggestive, but declined to rule on harmless error argument that had been advanced for the first time in this Court saying that it wished the lower courts to resolve that issue first before it got involved in what was essentially a factual determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.842" offset="5394787">And so for these reasons we would ask that the judgment of the Court of Appeals be reversed not at the judgment of conviction be reinstated, but that the case be remanded to the Court of Appeals for appropriate disposition in accordance with the suggestion in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.460" offset="5457168">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sherman L. Cohn</label>
            <text syncTime="1347.720" offset="5494262">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.626" offset="5509831">The government we submit is quite correct in Wade when it urged upon this Court that there is no meaningful difference as concerns the right to counsel between a pretrial identification from photographs and as similar pretrial identification made in the lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.031" offset="5623515">Indeed the trial judge in this case, himself testified or stated in May 1968 that there had been a recent increase in the use of photographic identification in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.378" offset="5700838">This was nine months after the decision in Wade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.759" offset="5722363">I respectfully suggest that this case illustrates precisely that the government was correct in Wade, that Wade was a correct decision and still is and that drawing an artificial distinction between corporeal identification and procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.668" offset="5810030">And photographic identification procedures would not only be in the Solicitor General’s words “meaningless,” but would permit the continued easy use of this device to evade this Court’s clear holding in Wade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.078" offset="5899682">One needs only to examine the facts in this case to see how intentionally or unintentionally, the United States Attorney attempted to use what I respectfully suggest is impermissible suggestiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.105" offset="5967809">I invite each and every member of the Court to examine personally the colored photographs of the 1968 identification procedures which are in your file.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.321" offset="6028622">I respectfully urge that they portray graphically what this case is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.137" offset="6059969">Witnesses to the crime who had little opportunity to see the robbers who made indefinite or no identifications at a photographic array some five months after the crime, who after the crime could describe the robbers only as to height about six foot to build, thin to slender, and color black or light complexion, were shown almost three years later and at that the day before the trial, five photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.250" offset="6216391">Three of these were sized 3x3 or 3x4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.744" offset="6234363">One of the defendant, Bailey, was 4x6 and that of the defendant Ash was 5x7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.632" offset="6269889">Only two are full length, only two with height markers to indicate six foot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.248" offset="6300400">Only two carried the police identification numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.496" offset="6317328">Only two were thin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.168" offset="6328090">In each and every case these two were the persons to be tried the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.268" offset="6356407">This, the government calls the preparation of a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.020" offset="6379499">The government urges that the fact that we know these facts demonstrates that the presence of counsel at the photographic ID could serve no purpose, but here we part ways with the government and for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.953" offset="6459225">First as Gilbert versus California makes clear, the requirement for the counsel at the critical stages of procedures is not only to permit the raising and the proper presentation of defenses, but also as the prophylactic to deter the constitutionally objectable, the practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.785" offset="6574477">Although I find the curious and surprising to find and learned United State attorney engaging in such practices as I described, nine months after the Stowell and two months after the sentience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.996" offset="6635395">I would find it most difficult to conceive of a United States Attorney engaging in such tactics in the presence of a counsel for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.245" offset="6680325">He would stand there as a reminder, a graphical reminder that due process must be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.103" offset="6719822">Secondly although we know much of what happened at the photographic array, we cannot know all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.645" offset="6761932">We do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.532" offset="6765484">We cannot know the nuisances, the gestures, the intonations that might have been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.844" offset="6798712">The government urges that these matters could be a developing cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.107" offset="6823790">My learned colleague states that there’s no reason in the world why the witness cannot testify as to the words that were used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.669" offset="6866004">I suggest there is a reason and the reason is stated in Wade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.537" offset="6881468">The reason is that the unschooled layman who does not and cannot be expected to note those matters that are important, and besides if he does note them they won’t work.</text>

            <text syncTime="1759.067" offset="7139662">We are now in after Kirby so that we are dealing with a post indictment situation as distinguished from a pre-indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.201" offset="7188146">Where there is investigation going on, where there has not yet been a focusing, where there has not been an indictment, where no the criminal proceedings or prosecutions which ever word one wishes to use has begun, we have an entirely different story than we do after indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.601" offset="7273827">Here there has not only been a focusing but you have a man who is incarcerated several blocks away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.958" offset="7315205">The trial is about to begin and what we have is an identification which is then entered as positive evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1830.881" offset="7426905">So that whatever tape there is from the fact that it was offered during the defendant’s case, it was not during this defendant’s case, and he did not offer it, then we’d have an entirely different proposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="3251.882" offset="13110941">Mr. Chief Justice, I would just want to allude to one or two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.223" offset="13140302">The only real substantive policy reason which has been suggested for having counsel present by Mr. Cohn is that would act as a deterrent the very fact that counsel was present there would act as a deterrent against the use of suggestive procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.016" offset="13203414">I don’t think that that deterrent is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.885" offset="13214908">It’s enough of the deterrent to the prosecutor that if he engages in a suggestive identification procedure, he is going totally endanger the in-court identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.829" offset="13266735">That’s represented by the very facts in this case, but even if we are successful here we are hardly out of the woods in terms of sustaining the judgment of conviction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.373" offset="13308844">So that by engaging in suggestive procedures, he is endangering the entire in-court identification, bringing upon himself the whole mess of problems before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.828" offset="13350640">In the second place by having a suggestive photographic procedure he also undermines to a substantial degree whatever corroborative basis the fact that an out of court identification was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.593" offset="13401736">It’s not likely to have very much impact with the jury that before trial, a witness picked out a photograph in an array that was obviously suggestive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.123" offset="13439875">And of course finally that substantive policy reason for having a lawyer present was not even suggested as I understood or read the Court's opinion in Wade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.849" offset="13482820">Also there’s been some illusion both in the opinion of the Court of Appeals and by Mr. Cohn to the government’s brief in Wade where we’re quoted as saying that there’s no difference between a photo lineup and a photographic display.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.887" offset="13542902">What the government said in Wade was that clearly no one has ever suggested that a lawyer was required when photographs were shown, and that we saw no difference as far as lineups go.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.590" offset="13605700">This Court disagreed only to the extent that it did find the differences as far as lineups went but as a matter of fact, the opinion Mr. Justice Brennan pointed out that the prosecution could show in attempting to evade a taint finding that there had in fact been a prior identification by photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.831" offset="13690650">And these, unless there any questions, are the only two points that I want to make.</text>
