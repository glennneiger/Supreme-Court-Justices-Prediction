            <text syncTime="46.453" offset="289207">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.617" offset="301850">This case is here on direct appeal from a three-judge District Court sitting in the Middle District of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.505" offset="329435">The District Court enjoined the enforcement of Interstate Commerce Commission Rules prescribing an incentive element to be added to the daily rentals that one railroad pays to another for the use of its boxcars.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.052" offset="383561">The basic question presented is whether the Commission should have afforded the appellee, Railroads, in oral hearing prior to promulgating the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.648" offset="429955">The incentive per diem rules here in issue were promulgated under Section 114 (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.330" offset="460675">That section authorizes the Commission, after hearing, to establish reasonable rules with respect to car service including the compensation to be paid for the use of freight cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.160" offset="516054">Under a 1966 amendment to that section, the Commission may, in fixing that compensation, prescribe an incentive element to improve the use of existing cars and to encourage the acquisition of new cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.418" offset="581047">Freight car shortages have been a serious and recurring problem throughout most of this century.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.270" offset="600482">In recent years, the Commission, with the strong encouragement and support of Congress, has been moving on a number of fronts to combat this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.381" offset="636844">Just last term in the Allegheny-Ludlum case, this Court upheld two car service rules promulgated by the Commission under Section 114 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="144.030" offset="679476">Those rules governed the return of unloaded freight cars to their owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.179" offset="704136">The instant rule making proceeding was initiated by the Commission in 1967 after an earlier proceeding had been dismissed for warrant of sufficient evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.832" offset="754709">In initiating this proceeding, the Commission ordered the railroads to participate in a nationwide study of freight car shortages.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.039" offset="795564">During an 11-month period in 1968, over 32,000 reports were filed from state stations throughout the country-- no, it were filed from about 2,600 freight stations throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.121" offset="859826">Each report listed for a given day at a given station: (1) the freight cars ordered by shippers for delivery on or before that day, (2) the number of cars available at that station for placement to shippers, and (3) the number of cars actually delivered to shippers during that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.117" offset="955852">Extensive field audits were conducted by Commission personnel to assure that the reports were filed and filled out directly and, also, to assure that they did not reflect over-auditing of cars by shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.685" offset="1030144">The collective data were put on magnetic tapes and were available to the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.909" offset="1058983">In December 1969, the Commission issued an interim report containing an analysis of the data collected from the study and proposing a rule establishing a scale of incentive per diem charges for plain boxcars.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.521" offset="1133484">In appendices to the report, the Commission described in detail the methodology employed by the study and set forth a series of tables and graphs showing the results of the studies-- the study for plain boxcars.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.471" offset="1205269">The study showed that there were deficiencies in placements of freight cars with shippers throughout the year, but that the deficiencies were most severe during the heavy traffic months from September through February each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.019" offset="1263470">The study also revealed that, at the same time the deficiencies were reported by some freight stations, surpluses of cars would be reported by other stations frequently on the same railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.097" offset="1327731">Analyzing these data, the Commission included that, at least during the peak period from September through February each year, the surpluses were not sufficient so that the railroads could be expected to eliminate the deficiencies simply by using their boxcars more efficiently.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.969" offset="1415293">The Commission, thus, concluded that the existing supply of plain boxcars was inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.245" offset="1440371">It does propose the incentive per diem rules to be applicable during the six-month heavy loaded-- heavy traffic period of each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.972" offset="1503274">Now, the proposed incentive rules were designed by the Commission to do two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.277" offset="1524485">First, they were designed to improve the utilization of existing cars and, second, they were designed to provide funds to those railroads who earned per diem income than they paid out with which to purchase new freight cars to augment the national supply.</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel Huntington</label>
            <text syncTime="377.011" offset="1611421">Yes, they would.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.724" offset="1622288">The interim report noted that the proposals were tentative and invited the railroads to submit verified statements of fact and briefs with respect to their proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.278" offset="1660531">The Commission ordered that any party requesting an oral hearing should set forth in detail its need for an oral hearing in the evidence it intended to reduce.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.401" offset="1709014">In response to the interim report, numerous railroads filed verified statements and briefs, some supporting the proposed rules and others opposing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.221" offset="1748302">Several railroads requested oral hearings, including both appellees here.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.614" offset="1769827">Seaboard, in its statement to the Commission, primarily argued that the Commission should not impose incentive charges on plain boxcars without also imposing them on specially equipped cars.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="426.912" offset="1810996">What way, if any, should be given here now to the fact determinations of the District Court or at least a mixed fact in law determination that-- relating to prejudice?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_huntington" startTime="447.324" stopTime="689.008">
            <label>Mr. Samuel Huntington</label>
            <text syncTime="447.324" offset="1892707">Well, in our view, it’s not so much a question of fact as it is a question of the proper standard to be applied in determining prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.800" offset="1930533">Our primary argument on that point, which I will come to in due course, is that the District Court simply applied the wrong standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.937" offset="1975150">Well, Florida East Coast did file two verified statements setting forth its position on the rules in some detail, and it also requested an oral hearing and it specified four factors which it would-- intended to show at the oral hearing, and I will also discuss those.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.792" offset="2046516">While in April 1970, the Commission entered its final report and adopted the rules virtually in the same form as had been proposed in the interim report.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.271" offset="2096462">The Commission specifically answered and rejected the policy arguments advanced by Seaboard and Florida East Coast for not applying the rules to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.404" offset="2133034">It had also rejected all the requests for oral hearing on the grounds that no party showed prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.095" offset="2163754">Both Seaboard and Florida East Coast then brought actions in the Florida District Court and the District Court set aside the Commission’s order for failure to hold oral hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.610" offset="2229791">The Appellees based their claim to an oral hearing in addition to one of the provision of Section 114 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="539.843" offset="2262706">They place their claim on Section 556 (d) of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.115" offset="2287783">That section provides that, in rule making, “an agency may, when a party will not be prejudice thereby, adopt procedures for the submission of oral or part of the evidence in written form.”</text>
            <text syncTime="559.945" offset="2343163">The appellees claim that they showed prejudice in their submissions to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.202" offset="2368136">Before reaching this issue though, there is a threshold issue of whether Section 556 (d) applies at all to this rule making proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.767" offset="2414425">Now, Section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act sets forth the basic procedural requirements for rule making, and Section 553 (c) requires agencies to give interested parties “an opportunity to submit written data, views, or arguments with or without opportunity for oral presentation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="600.562" offset="2505644">Clearly, this was done in this case by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.888" offset="2518915">Section 553 (c), however, goes on to state that “when rules are required by statute to be made on the record after an opportunity for agency hearing, Sections 556 and 557 apply instead of this subsection.”</text>
            <text syncTime="622.616" offset="2593834">Now, Section 114 (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act, under which the rules here were promulgated, requires a hearing but it no where states that the Commission’s decision must be on the record of that hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.684" offset="2666141">Now, unless the “on the record” requirement can be inferred from the context of the statute, Sections 556 and 557 of the Administrative procedure would not apply to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.137" offset="2715878">Now, this precise issue was decided by this Court in the Allegheny-Ludlum case last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.696" offset="2742105">In the applicable passage this Court stated, we do not suggest that only the precise words on the record in the applicable statute will suffice to make Sections 556 and 557 applicable to rule making proceedings, but we do hold that the language of the Esch Car Service Act, which is Section 114 (a), is insufficient to invoke these sections.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="689.008" offset="2859447">But your opponents come back there and argue that because of the 1966 amendment, in its language, saying that the additional determination should be made whether upon these considerations, that that is an implied requirement.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_huntington" startTime="704.538" stopTime="1125.813">
            <label>Mr. Samuel Huntington</label>
            <text syncTime="704.538" offset="2921514">Well, they do and our response to that is that the 1966 amendment simply builds on what was there before and it does require the Commission to take into account certain factors before imposing an incentive element but, in no way, suggested that, in considering those factors, the Commission must do so only on the basis of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.516" offset="3021406">The hearing requirement whether you’re considering a proceeding as in Allegheny under the first-- in Allegheny-Ludlum under the first part of the statute or whether you’re considering incentive per diem proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.102" offset="3071770">Under the second part, the hearing requirement is the same, and that requirement is imposed in the very beginning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.470" offset="3125269">In short, we believe that the Allegheny-Ludlum holding is controlling here, but I’d like to turn now to the second part of our argument which assumes that Section 556 does apply to this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.323" offset="3192665">In that event, the Commission was justified in doing away and not having-- not holding oral hearings unless appellees have established before the Commission that they would be prejudiced by the absence of an oral hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.932" offset="3259120">The critical question here then is what showing is necessary to establish prejudice and did appellees make that showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.574" offset="3305618">In our view, there are two basic tests that a request for oral hearing must meet to establish prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.656" offset="3338010">And getting back to your question, Mr. Chief Justice, we would maintain that the District Court did not apply these tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.712" offset="3366222">Therefore, its finding of prejudice was based on an erroneous standard and is not a finding of fact which this Court should defer to.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.305" offset="3408541">The first and most obvious test is that the request must show a need to establish facts in an oral hearing that could not be adequately established through written submissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.217" offset="3456188">Both appellees have failed to meet this initial test.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.247" offset="3472384">Florida East Coast’s basic opposition to the rules stems from the fact that it is located on a peninsula and terminates far more plain boxcar traffic than it originates, and because a lot of the traffic terminates in the southern part of Florida as the verified statements submitted shows, the railroad must continue to pay per diem charges until it can get the unloaded boxcars back to the northern part of its line and on to a connecting railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.355" offset="3600802">Florida East Coast argues that because it owns sufficient plain boxcars to satisfy the limited needs of its shippers for plain boxcars and because it operates an efficient operation and generally returns empty cars as fast as it can, the incentive per diem rules would neither prompt it to purchase new cars nor result in the faster return of freight cars and, therefore, the rule shouldn’t be applied to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.872" offset="3714905">While this argument shows that the application of the rules may not be in Florida East Coast’s best interest, they do not show that an oral hearing was necessary to establish these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.056" offset="3767568">In fact, these facts I’ve just outlined were set forth in verified statements in some detail submitted by Florida East Coast, and the Commission’s final report shows that it considered the arguments advanced by Florida East Coast, these policy arguments, and it considered the verified statements but concluded that an exemption from the incentive rules for all terminating roads would not be in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.804" offset="3882611">Now, Seaboard’s basic opposition to the rules is based on its ownership of a large number of specially equipped boxcars to which the rules do not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.936" offset="3919078">Although Seaboard did not submit any verified statements, it has made no showing that it could not have established this fact by written submissions and that it has made no showing that an oral hearing was necessary here.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.275" offset="3968502">Now, perhaps recognizing that an oral hearing was not necessary to establish the adverse effect of the rules on them, both railroads argue that an oral hearing was necessary to cross-examine Commission personnel on the preparation an analysis of the freight car study.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.889" offset="4074977">Here too, however, appellees could have challenged the Commission’s conclusion from the study by written submission and arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.662" offset="4106010">The appendices to the Commission’s interim report set forth in plain terms the methodology of the study.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.477" offset="4141328">No one has suggested that this methodology was unsound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.291" offset="4164524">I’d like to quote from the-- a verified statement submitted by the Penn Central, this is on page 151 of the appendix, where the Penn Central concedes the study data appears to have been gathered by recognized methods of sampling and statistical techniques.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.207" offset="4236204">Penn Central then goes on to quibble with the conclusions reached by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.202" offset="4260133">I don’t understand appellees to suggest that the statistical method used here were inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.878" offset="4290853">With this challenge, the Commission’s conclusions from the tables and graphs that the incentive per diem rule should be adopted to improve the utilization and supply of freight cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.945" offset="4339127">They challenge the analysis that the Commission made from the data and the Commission’s conclusion that there was indeed a national shortage of freight cars and that the rules reasonably adopted to combat that shortage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.163" offset="4407986">Well, if appellees believe that the conclusions are unsound, their remedy is not to cross-examine Commission personnel who assisted the Commission in analyzing these data as part of the decision making process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.057" offset="4471620">Their remedy is to analyze the data on their own, as I stated before, the data were available to them, and on the basis of their own analysis to argue against the Commission’s conclusions or, for that matter, they could start with the Commission tables and graphs in the interim report and argue that the Commission’s conclusions based on that data were inappropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1138.706" offset="4658239">Florida East Coast does challenge the way in which part of the data was obtained and that is when I said that the reports submitted to the railroads required each freight station to list the number of cars ordered by shippers for placement on or before the study date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.802" offset="4766595">Florida East Coast maintains that it’s unreasonable to include in the orders, orders which were received on the study day for placement that day and this, I think you probably-- can properly be construed as an attack on the method of the study.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.460" offset="4833259">I think the Commission recognized that this perhaps was a deficiency in the study.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.361" offset="4852799">In fact, they proposed a further study in 1969, which was opposed by both railroads, in which they would have remedied that particular point and they would’ve only listed as orders, orders received by the beginning of the study day for placement on or before the study day and would not have included orders received on the study day for placement that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.498" offset="4961364">But, to the extent that Florida East Coast wants to establish that, that’s conceded that there is a deficiency there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.024" offset="5007444">Well, the second basic test that a party must show, as you remember, I said there were two tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.495" offset="5033357">The second basic test they must show to show prejudice from the absence of an oral hearing is to show that the facts it desires to establish at an oral hearing are material and have a reasonable chance of influencing the Commission in reaching its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.977" offset="5099290">With respect to their asserted need to cross-examine Commission personnel, both appellees have completely failed this test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.569" offset="5133667">Seaboard has failed to indicate in any way what facts it would wish to establish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.743" offset="5158327">Florida East Coast, on its part, did list what it hoped to establish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.979" offset="5175254">One thing it did hope to establish was this 24-hour business about freight cars ordered for placement on the study day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.950" offset="5211199">The other “facts” that it wished to establish were: (1) that the deficiencies reported in the study “may not” be affected by the supply of cars in other regions, (2) that the addition of new plain boxcars “would necessarily” reduce the number of deficiencies, and (3) that no one could tell exactly how many boxcars were needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.916" offset="5351006">I believe it’s highly unlikely that the establishment of these facts would have surprised or impressed the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.419" offset="5385070">The Commission, throughout its report, does not contend that they’re operating on a perfect set of data here whether they can guarantee that the rules they’re adopting will in fact work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.857" offset="5446823">What they are saying, what the Commission did say, is that we have this balanced statistical evidence that, in our best judgment, this evidence shows that there is a shortage and, in our best judgment, the proper way to go about it is by trying these incentive rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.023" offset="5527489">The Commission said that the rules were designed “to test whether a financial incentive can be employed to augment the car fleet.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.530" offset="5565524">This is in the nature of an experiment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.747" offset="5582346">The Commission, at several points, said that the proceedings would remain open and that the rules could be revised in view of the experience of the railroads after they had been in effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1626.449" offset="6609168">Now, the reason we suggested that remand is not necessary is we believe that a-- that these issues are not substantial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1690.709" offset="6866213">I represent the Florida East Coast Railway Co.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.057" offset="6879587">With the consent of the Court, Mr. Hollander, the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad, will divide-- and I will divide the time available to the appellees, and we hope to avoid repetition in our arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.482" offset="6933295">I shall undertake to discuss whether the Commission order is required to be made on the record of a hearing, that is whether the parties were entitled to an oral hearing under Sections 556 and 557 of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.306" offset="7004557">I will also discuss whether the Florida East Coast was prejudiced by the denial of this request for a hearing and oral argument, a request to cross-examine Commission agents on their audits and studies, and the request to subpoena Commission experts to present testimony to contradict the basic facts assumed and asserted in the Commission’s report imposing incentive per diem charges on the railroad industry and on the Florida East Coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.308" offset="7140603">Now, Sections 556 and 557 of the Administrative Procedure Act are applicable, we think, because the Commission action, in fixing compensation to be paid for the use of freight cars, is quasi-judicial action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.211" offset="7204237">Like agency actions considered in Morgan, a rate case, the Ohio Bell Telephone case, and the division cases which this Court has recently decided in North-South divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.198" offset="7260139">The Commission order must be based on the record of a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.214" offset="7284276">The nature of the Commission’s action in this case, that is to say you must pay another railroad so much for the use of its equipment, in freight car compensation proceedings, distinguish this proceeding from the Commission’s order to prescribing operative rules, and that’s the rule that was involved in Allegheny-Ludlum.</text>

            <text syncTime="1860.037" offset="7543515">I would go further, however, and say, as the Courts have said in, for example, Palmer v.

            <text syncTime="2209.474" offset="8941275">Certainly, but I thought that I could-- I thought that I would be able to prove before the Commission some of the things that I held were essential to their taking action in the first place, if they had given me an opportunity to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.319" offset="9004596">Let me talk for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.924" offset="9015045">We are-- let me just conclude our argument on this question of what we’re entitled to as to why a way of a hearing, and say that we think the statute itself sets up standards and requires findings, and that statute prohibits, for example, the Interstate Commerce Commission for making an incentive per diem applicable to any type of car, the supply of which is adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.853" offset="9130820">Now, surely, it was open to me to demonstrate that under any measure of act of adequacy that they would-- that there was an adequate supply of the plain boxcars to which the Commission referred and to which it made incentive per diem applicable, and that’s what I attempted to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.250" offset="9216397">Now, we say that the statute requiring these considerations clearly indicates that the Commission must take-- must make findings, and that those findings are quasi-judicial in their scope and character.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.489" offset="9285360">We also say that this is supported not only by the statute, but by the legislative history of that-- of this section of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.687" offset="9318170">It is supported by the Commission’s own determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.105" offset="9335829">This proceeding was not started without reference to 556 and 557.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.673" offset="9362056">The Commission said that it was complying with Sections 556 and 557 when it initiated the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.683" offset="9394134">It initiated them under those sections and it purported to decide them in compliance with those sections of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.919" offset="9423078">It is only for the first time in this Court that it is claimed that 556 and 557 and the hearing requirements of those sections do not apply to this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.204" offset="9480234">Now, let me turn for just a second to this question of what I attempted to do by way of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.433" offset="9517119">I attempted to subpoena Commission personnel familiar with and expert in freight car supply, allocation, and movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.933" offset="9571140">People whom the Commission had themselves testified in prior proceedings that testimony of persons that had them-- had been offered as witnesses in prior proceedings on these very points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.710" offset="9638222">And, I offered-- and I wanted to prove with that testimony that the standard of adequacy that was applied by the Commission in this case was improper, was not right, that it was an unreasonable one, and I wanted to do it with expert testimony and I couldn’t do that with my own experts because every expert that testified that it was a railroad was referred to by the Commission as “that is an opinion of a railroad official.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.487" offset="9781269">You’ll see it in their report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.553" offset="9789628">I wanted to present another testimony of a non-railroad official with nationwide experience with respect to this matter, not Florida East Coast.</text>

            <text syncTime="2463.959" offset="9959215">I also wanted to have that person testify, those people testify that if you applied a standard that you should furnish the car on demand on the day it was requested, that such a supply of plain boxcars would be so great, now mind you this is at all stations, at all locations throughout the United States that this kind of a standard would apply, the supply would be so great, they would have so many boxcars, you’d have so many car that the traffic wouldn’t move on the railroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="2608.555" offset="10537566">We said, first, that there was a lack of a proper hearing and Mr. Layne has covered that subject, and I simply want to say that I agree with points which he raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.597" offset="10589811">We also charged in the Court below that ICC had failed to comply with the requirements of 114 (a) and then we said that the Commission’s conclusions lack sufficient evidentiary support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.044" offset="10659506">The Court below found for us, as you know, on the hearing issue and, for that reason, said that it would not and in fact it did not discuss the other contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.045" offset="10711542">In its reply brief, the government has said that these other issues are not substantial and, of course, we disagree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.275" offset="10760443">Mr. Huntington, in his argument today, treated lightly, if at all, with the other issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.289" offset="10784580">He should not, I submit, because he is asking you to overturn the lower Court’s decision and to reinstate the decision of the ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.744" offset="10842363">Now, Section 114 (a), as certainly you know by now, is three sentences in length.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.337" offset="10872769">The first one, the one you treated with in Allegheny-Ludlum is from the 1917-ish Car Service Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.862" offset="10910804">We’re talking about the other two sentences that were the result of Public Law 89430, and those sentences tell the Commission what factors they must c consider in determining the payment of compensation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Hollander</label>
            <text syncTime="2784.594" offset="11241723">For the reasons stated by Mr. Layne, and that’s correct, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.225" offset="11260322">I’m of course, now, talking about these other points and I say that the Court below, had it reach those points which it did not, would’ve found in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.347" offset="11316746">I’m pretty confident about that because I use as a starting point the Commission’s own 1967 incentive per diem decision, the one that Mr. Huntington mentioned to you a few moments ago, the decision which led up to the one which is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.496" offset="11385396">That 1967 decision itself demonstrates, in the Commission’s own words, that what it did here was arbitrary and was not rationally supported and, of course, Section 706 of the Administrative Procedure Act says that a review in Court ought to hold such a decision unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.329" offset="11480691">The 1967 decision which is in 332 ICC listed a number of specific factors which the Commission felt it had to consider in deciding upon incentive per diem compensation, and which weren’t considered here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.015" offset="11551431">And, it concluded in that proceeding, after extensive hearings and incidentally including all hearings in which ICC personnel were examined, that incentive per diem would not improve operating practices nor would it lead to more efficient use of cars nor would the building of more cars be generated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.513" offset="11653413">That’s what the Commission said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.373" offset="11664906">Without considering those factors which it said in 1967 it had to look into and which I submit 114 (a) says it must look into, it decided here in the case before Your Honors that it wouldn’t examine into those factors and it did a complete about-face and prescribed an incentive per diem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.169" offset="11756022">Now, insofar as car ownership is concerned, my railroad, my company is a creditor road.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.276" offset="11788518">It bought and built boxcars as the ICC directed to meet the needs of shippers on its lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.911" offset="11823000">Particularly prejudicial to us then, was the decision of the Commission that some time in its internal consideration of the proceeding and without, in any way, warning us in the convening notices that it would confine incentive per diem to plain boxcars, to standard boxcars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.698" offset="11914115">This was done after concluding in the 1967 decision that for most-- for much transportation the standard boxcar has been replaced, that equipped boxcars frequently are used for the same purpose as standard boxcars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.333" offset="11984750">And, after telling us in such decisions as the one you reviewed in Allegheny-Ludlum that any failure on our part to acquire cars to meet the needs of shippers on our lines would be unconscionable, to use their word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.958" offset="12051205">Again, we did tailor our car fleet, but in equipping boxcars they no longer could be designated plain boxcars and they don’t, therefore, qualify for incentive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.165" offset="12100002">So, in the netting out of incentive per diem, we’ll be called upon to pay over to other railroads, one of them our major competitor, wild amounts of money and, of course, our overall freight car program, which we think had been pretty good, is going to suffer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3030.569" offset="12225599">Let me say several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.176" offset="12232077">First of all, it was 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.972" offset="12247228">We did respond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.381" offset="12252871">We did object on grounds which I had just been stating and, furthermore, I would like to submit the proposition to this Court that what I received in the interim decision was a fixed anticipatory judgment and I don’t think it was ever meant to yield to any facts that we might submit later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.471" offset="12345240">We tried-- we started studies in order to try to dispute some of the things that the Commission had raised and we asked for more time to do it and the Commission wouldn’t give it to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.246" offset="12384319">Within two-month’s time, it had come out with its final report which was the same with all practical respects as its interim report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.191" offset="12424129">Now, Section 114 (a) tells the Commission again that it must consider all factors affecting the national freight car supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.381" offset="12472926">It didn’t do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.918" offset="12479091">As again I said, in its 1967 decision it told us it had to, and if the Court below had gotten to that question, which it did not, I’m confident that it would have sustained our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.978" offset="12531336">Now, you heard Mr. Huntington a few moments back to say that what the Commission did was an experiment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.402" offset="12564982">Those-- that’s not his word.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.367" offset="12572818">That’s the Commission’s word. They said what it was doing here was an experiment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.039" offset="12595493">In experimenting, it’s going to take millions of our dollars not as a penalty for doing something wrong, but simply to give to other carriers for reasons over which we have no control, and I submit to Your Honors that there’s no law that permits the ICC to do that particularly in the absence of due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="3147.544" offset="12693504">Well, Mr. Hollander, as a matter at least of theoretical operation, you’re not required to use other freight carriers and you’re not required, are you, to lend you freight cars to anyone else?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Hollander</label>
            <text syncTime="3163.737" offset="12758288">Let me say, Your Honor, that we are required to use other railroad’s boxcars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.941" offset="12791097">You see, we originate cars-- freight on our line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.830" offset="12806666">We use the cars which we have bought to meet the needs of our shippers, and they go out and they head west.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.790" offset="12826520">For example, when we turn them over-- when we turn those cars over to our connecting lines going west, they must take those cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.894" offset="12858911">Similarly, on cars coming east-south onto our line, we must take them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.574" offset="12889631">We may not have any need for them but we must take them with the load.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.452" offset="12905200">We must deliver the load, but immediately upon the taking of those cars at our junction, we are at once charged with incentive per diem which, as you know, is something over and above the regular per diem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.094" offset="12963715">This is a penalty against us for no wrong for which we have done, except to follow the Interstate Commerce Commission directive to acquire cars to meet the needs of the shippers on our line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.760" offset="13014392">Now, of course, what the Commission is asking us to do now is don’t do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.329" offset="13032678">Forget the idea of buying equipped boxcars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.767" offset="13050441">Apply your money, your revenues to the purchase of plain boxcars which somebody else needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.058" offset="13103626">Let me take a moment to say too, in arguing that there’s no support for the Commission’s conclusion, that-- or little support, there’s no support at all, not one bit in the record that the use and movement of cars would improve as a result of incentive per diem, and the Commission never even bothered to look into the question of how the weak debtor railroads were going to be able to afford the additional investment for cars, which the ICC concluded in this decision, would be acquired by them because of this incentive per diem rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.378" offset="13280841">Now, Mr. Huntington, in answering your question, Mr. Justice Blackmun, spoke of two-and-a half years of experience now before the Commission in this incentive per diem experiment and he mentioned, and so did Mr. Layne, that there are pending petitions before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.191" offset="13380106">The first one was filed in July.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.574" offset="13389720">Not a word has been heard from the ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.456" offset="13401213">There had been a great many file since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.154" offset="13415946">Over 20 railroads, including the Penn Central in fact, have asked the ICC to abandon this incentive per diem concept because of the fact that it simply isn’t working.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.438" offset="13473102">In fact, the government itself-- I have in front of me the government’s petition, the petition of the Department of Agriculture, which says that the national fleet of boxcar is still shrinking and its says that the Commission ought to reopen this proceeding to see if, in fact, there is a plain boxcar shortage.</text>

            <text syncTime="3389.657" offset="13662020">If there is a critical shortage of boxcars, I would say they should’ve acted immediately upon some suspicion that this experiment is not working.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.267" offset="13704443">It’s more than two or three months, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.955" offset="13719176">It’s two or three years now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.248" offset="13728371">They have the same figures that we have that show that there has been a constant decrease in the number of plain boxcars in the railroad’s fleet, a constant decrease after the incentive per diem went into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.178" offset="13792110">There are 45,000 less plain boxcars in the fleet today than there were when incentive per diem went into effect, and this has been a study decline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.338" offset="13828681">This was known to the Commission in the first year after it put this experiment into order, into work, and the Commission itself in its order said that it was going to take a look and if this didn’t work then it would reopen and take another look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.296" offset="13892524">And, it’s been two-and-a half years and the Commission simply has not done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.085" offset="13927737">My time is almost up, and I want to point out to this Court what it has said in a number of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.752" offset="13950412">Most recently, to my knowledge, in the Bee and Oak case in 393 US which involved the Division of Revenues that it’s not going to be led off by a haze of certain expertise, to use your words, and you are not, you said, going to bridge the gap by blind reliance on expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.684" offset="14042154">And, that’s precisely what you’re being asked to do here and it will not do for the Commission to come to you, as it’s done in its jurisdictional statement, and tell you that it was moved to a decision by an impatient Congress, a Congress which told the Commission that it had had enough facts in its record to go ahead and make a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.614" offset="14133791">I submit that the Commission must, in fact, have that necessary information, and it did not here.</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel Huntington</label>
            <text syncTime="3675.079" offset="14803675">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.104" offset="14803571">The-- I’d first like to correct one statement I made in response to a question by Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.151" offset="14803466">The Commission does not concede that the method of reporting orders on its study was deficient, and this point is addressed in a response to an inquiry by the railroads while the freight car was-- while the study was being done, and that response is found at pages 189-190 of the appendix and I’ll simply refer the Court to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.931" offset="14803362">On the existence of the shortage and on most of Mr. Hollander’s points about whether the Commission did in fact comply with the standards of Section 114 (a), I refer the Court to the interim report and, specifically, to pages 66 (a)-70 (a) of the jurisdictional statement appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.044" offset="14803257">There, the-- that’s the critical part of the interim report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.542" offset="14803153">It’s in appendix A and, there, the Court analyzes in considerable detail and shows exactly the steps it goes through in concluding that there is a shortage and that the percent of the rule should be adopted to combat that shortage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.681" offset="14803048">To the extent, of course, that there is further evidence that, now, that maybe the shortage isn’t as bad or maybe it’s worse, of course that can be submitted to the Commission now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.772" offset="14802944">I just also like to point out that the-- in addition to these petitions which are now pending, the American Association of Railroads did petition for modification of the rule some time ago asking that the funds collected from the incentive per diem charges be available for leasing cars in addition to purchasing new cars, and the Commission now has that and will probably come out with a decision in the not too distant future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.057" offset="14802840">Finally, in response to a point Mr. Justice White made, the Allegheny-Ludlum case, and this case involved precisely the same section of the Interstate Commerce Act and the same hearing requirement, it’s that-- it’s the third and fourth word in the Section 114 (a) and, therefore, we say that the requirement should not be different in one proceeding than it is in this proceeding.</text>
