            <label>Mr. Thomas Keister Greer</label>
            <text syncTime="33.315" offset="236648">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.131" offset="251904">This case is here on appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.600" offset="273742">Like the case which the Court just heard, it also involves the question of the franchise in a water district.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.493" offset="309373">The Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District comprehends approximately 193,000 acres, almost entirely in Kings County California in the Southern San Joaquin Valley.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.414" offset="369037">There are nine water storage districts in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.074" offset="383666">There is no magic in the word storage in the title.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.527" offset="401429">It functions like an ordinary water or ordinary irrigation district.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.620" offset="429850">The thing which sets a water storage district apart and the reason that these appellants are here today are two California statutes governing a suffrage in a water storage district.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.617" offset="497873">The first is Section 41000 the Water Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.835" offset="514696">It’s very short and clear into the point “Only the holders of title to land are entitled to vote at a general election” and the statute immediately following Section 4100, “Each voter may vote in each precinct in which any of the land owned by him is situated and may cast one vote for each $100 or fraction thereof, worth of land.”</text>
            <text syncTime="131.024" offset="627440">The appellants, plaintiffs below include a large land owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.570" offset="649697">A Salyer Land Company Farms approximately 28,000 acres of land in the district and about another 28,000 immediately outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.621" offset="685850">It includes a small landowner Harold Shawl has one-half interest in 65 acres in the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.412" offset="709047">It includes a nonlandowning resident, Lawrence Allison who is 67 years of old, has resided, has worked in the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.516" offset="761396">It’s stipulated in the record that he is actively interested in water matters, subscribes the water publications.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.683" offset="786056">Interested in water as is any normal human being in this part of California can’t vote.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="178.468" offset="817194">What’s the high and the low of these two large and small voters that you mentioned on the $100?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_keister_greer" startTime="185.685" stopTime="232.857">
            <label>Mr. Thomas Keister Greer</label>
            <text syncTime="185.685" offset="846137">The J. G. Boswell Company, Mr. Chief Justice, owns some 61,000 acres in the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.733" offset="874350">I think it leases an additional 8 or 10,000 acres. It farms approximately 40% of the district and has about 40% of its water.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.239" offset="916355">The -- there are some landholdings that are down to lessen -- to less than 20 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.907" offset="958986">I think there are 189 landowners in the district who own about 2.34% of the acreage.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.970" offset="995244">They own up to 80 acres of piece.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.400" offset="1004962">So there is a pattern of a good many small landowners and four large landowners.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.184" offset="1024084">One of which is that the appellant Salyer Land Company.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="232.857" offset="1034846">Then who -- how many votes did they get under this farm?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_keister_greer" startTime="236.958" stopTime="404.968">
            <label>Mr. Thomas Keister Greer</label>
            <text syncTime="236.958" offset="1051251">The J. G. Boswell Company gets 37,835 votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.631" offset="1069850">There is an exhibit in the record, the voting list of the last election that was held in the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.686" offset="1094092">The only election has been held in the district in 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.549" offset="1109556">A special election is called import by my client and that voting list is a source that information 37,825 votes for that one company.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.933" offset="1147068">Now, these appellants attack these statutes in the court below and they were both sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.547" offset="1189595">The majority sustained each statute, Circuit Judge Browning concurred in the exclusion of residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.801" offset="1242572">He didn’t think there was enough governmental impact to justify giving the ballot to residents but he dissented on the waiting of the franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.758" offset="1294399">Circuit Judge Browning wrote a good and lengthy opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.382" offset="1304952">He couldn’t go along with a notion of granting one vote for each $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.327" offset="1328671">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, to gain a notion of what this country looks like, there is an aerial photograph which is exhibit 1 following page 66 in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.764" offset="1382379">This district is divided into 11 divisions which brings up what is to me most -- one of the most interesting facets of the case and in its present posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.376" offset="1424906">Each division is represented by a director.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.870" offset="1438804">The directors are supposed to be chosen at these biennial elections which are held.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.404" offset="1465031">Now, the plaintiffs below, when they filed their suit, of course the complainant set forth in the appendix, also attacked the manner in which the divisions had been created.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.757" offset="1510379">The manner, I should say, in which they have been maintained because the assessed valuation in one of the divisions was as low as $600,000 in assessed valuation of one of my clients, Reid Sawyer was $2 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.136" offset="1571924">And we said that among the other things we said at any rate, there are to be some equity in the way these are setup according to assessed valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.099" offset="1607764">And we got a unanimous ruling of the court below on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.786" offset="1626467">The all three judges said that these divisions would have to be withdrawn so that they represented the same number of dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.627" offset="1665860">The decisions may be considered unique in that extent and would seem to enunciate a doctrine which I might call, one dollar one vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.272" offset="1720508">Now --</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="404.968" offset="1723225">That issue is not here?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas Keister Greer</label>
            <text syncTime="406.314" offset="1728658">No, sir. Mr. Justice Blackmun, while the district -- while insisting in the court below vigorously insisted that it wasn’t a governmental unit and are continuing to insist that in the briefs before this Court did not file a cross-appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.727" offset="1806294">Now, I don’t mean to belabor the point but the court below relied on the Equal Protection Clause and said that those unequal divisions didn’t consist with equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.314" offset="1860629">It had defined, it’s a necessary credit to the decision, that the district had to be a governmental unit for to invoke the Equal Protection Clause as in the other decisions of this Court involving a disparity in the size of districts like the Hadley case or the first case in which this Court met the local governmental issue, the Avery case, Midland County, Texas and we think that since there has, since the Court did rule that way, and since there has been an appeal that the issue of a governmental nature of this district, I can establish it to you without this but we respectfully submit that it maybe the law the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="509.872" offset="2142856">I wouldn’t want to foreclose him from any argument you might wish to make but I just say that it occurs to me that the governmental, the nature of district below maybe -- may have been adjudicated without appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.205" offset="2196146">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, there are 77 residents unless they be landowners, they can’t vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.126" offset="2231881">I have mentioned Lawrence Allison.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.281" offset="2252466">I said a little bit about the landowners, they are 307 all of them together.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.450" offset="2277125">I have mentioned that there are 11 divisions; six of those 11 divisions are controlled by the J. G. Boswell Company with those 37,825 votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.621" offset="2317876">Two of the divisions are controlled by the Appellant Salyer Land Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.483" offset="2341282">Two are controlled by another corporation, West Lake Farms and one by South Lake Farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.862" offset="2366777">Now, the rigidity of that control is made very express in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.265" offset="2392482">The Frist (Inaudible) of the district based on 1967, based on my guess 25 years is still present today.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.852" offset="2414738">Mr. Louis T. Robinson told the California District Securities Commission in 1967, “I know you shouldn’t forecast elections and that causes me a little hesitancy to say what I’m going to say.”</text>
            <text syncTime="591.756" offset="2470431">The 11 divisions in this large farming operation are completely controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.858" offset="2490807">You are going to have the same 11 directors on Tuesday that you got today with one exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.454" offset="2509197">One of the directors is having some health trouble, he is going to be replaced but other than that they are going to be the same 11 directors and he continued (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="609.057" offset="2539604">I have no concern about the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.654" offset="2549948">Suddenly, if a new board of directors would come in, why then I have nothing but opinion but I have no concern about the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.418" offset="2573040">The 11 divisions are controlled by people with enough votes, put back the same electors, they have the same directors they have now including the two Sawyers had been sitting at this time, they’ll be returned, the other nine will be returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.494" offset="2625390">Now, what Mr. Robinson says about an election requires some explanation and I opt to say in the response to a question asked by Mr. Justice Marshall in the preceding argument that the California Water Code provides these elections shall be conducted in all respects as our elections governed by the Elections Code, that’s Section 41367 of the Water Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.812" offset="2730611">These are supposed to be bona fide public elections without curtaining, without secret ballot upholding and everything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.199" offset="2764152">And the legislature intended that there would be one every other year.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.398" offset="2780975">Section 41300 of the Water Code says an election known as the General Water Storage District Election shall be held in each district on the first Tuesday in February in each odd numbered year, that which a successor shall be chosen to each officer whose term expires in March next thereafter.</text>

            <text syncTime="795.590" offset="3285765">This case and the case which the Court just heard, deal with special districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.619" offset="3321814">The view of these appellants is that in determining whether or not the voting rights cases should apply to a special district.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.557" offset="3365595">The crucial question is, but what is the district concern?</text>
            <text syncTime="820.658" offset="3385971">Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District is concerned with water.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.010" offset="3403421">And the control of the water in an agriculture -- in an agricultural area is the control of everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.890" offset="3430902">I seem to recall that the Ancient Greeks spoke of the four basic elements of among others as earth, water and fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.826" offset="3466637">This one is water.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.120" offset="3471862">Now there are myriad of special districts in California, I suppose in most states.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.533" offset="3493491">For example, California has Mosquito Abatement Districts.</text>

            <text syncTime="947.454" offset="3893164">The district did have a major flood and it was getting ready to apply for some federal funds and it requested an official Attorney General opinion to submit to the Federal Government on the nature of the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.574" offset="3937677">The opinion of the California Attorney General is set forth on pages 17 and 18 of the district -- of the appendix and as referred to again on page 61 and the crucial part is this.</text>

            <text syncTime="981.561" offset="4029628">I have concluded that water storage districts are considered political subdivisions of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.311" offset="4060662">The Attorney General cited the leading case, Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District against Ohrt, 31 Cal. App. 2d 619.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.555" offset="4101622">And that case contains a very explicit statement of the governmental nature of these districts and also sets forth a very clear distinction between this district on the kind of district that was involved in the case which the Court just heard.</text>

            <text syncTime="1025.268" offset="4204440">The court used the proprietary and said that that was a proprietary type district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.276" offset="4228472">The Glenn-Colusa case cited as I say by the Attorney General of California and the leading case says this, “State agencies such as irrigation or reclamation districts are agencies of the state whose functions are considered exclusively governmental.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.450" offset="4293151">Their property is state-owned, held only for governmental purposes, they own no land in the proprietary sense.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1066.085" offset="4367757">It’s covered by the special statutes in California governing the immunity of governmental agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.473" offset="4393253">There is a special system in California whereby governmental agency can validate its actions to follow suit, to validate a contractor, devote in anything else it does, to get an interim judgment against the world and its -- when its final, its transactions can never be questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.217" offset="4456260">A very useful procedure and when it’s a great deal used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.608" offset="4469844">This district has the privilege of using that procedure, Section 860 and following Sections of the California Code of Civil procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1282.907" offset="5235022">Second, the -- this matter of flood control jurisdiction is the immediate reason why the appellant Salyer Land Company determined to attack the weighted voting system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.779" offset="5274520">And I would like to speak very briefly about the legal history of flood control and water storage districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.032" offset="5303463">The Act was passed in 1921.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.809" offset="5314644">The declarations of policy are in Section 58 of the Act, Stat. 1921, c. 914 at page 1766.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.339" offset="5348707">The expression of prevention of flood is found twice in the paragraph and spoken off as a purpose necessary to the accomplishment of a purpose that is indispensable to the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.793" offset="5398549">Now, the water storage district law was codified in 1951 based on the Water Code and those declarations of policy were omitted to superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.677" offset="5430105">But flood control is still specifically referred to in Section 44001 and telling the purposes which the district may operate that they cooperate in contract with the districts with the state of California or the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.364" offset="5484857">It says, for the following purposes, construction, acquisition, purchase, extension, operational maintenance of works through irrigation, drainage, storage, and flood control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.048" offset="5531564">The leading case in California on water storage districts is Tarpey against McClure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.341" offset="5556746">The statute was passed 1921.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.604" offset="5565837">A suit was immediately filed to try to get the legislation declared invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.700" offset="5586213">The California Supreme Court in Tarpey which was decided two years later in 23 held that the Act was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.910" offset="5615052">One of the reasons urged for its invalidity was that contrary to the California Constitution, it embrace more than one subject and the California Supreme Court which deals with water all the time were told that it has decided over 3,000 cases dealing with water law said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.015" offset="5699480">What they said was, they said the flood control and irrigation are two sides of the same point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.253" offset="5732394">They said that that’s all one subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.936" offset="5743156">The actual language of the Court is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.560" offset="5753605">The conservation of water by means of flood control work is to restrain flood waters which otherwise, it overflow the land and go to waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.810" offset="5778578">And incident there to, the reclaiming of the lands which otherwise reveal were floated rendered useless, the storage and distribution of such water purposes, irrigation all seems to us to be so legitimately and eminently connected one with another as not to constitute different subjects within purview of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.017" offset="5847437">It may be said that in these respects, the Act Test with a single object to wit, the better control and utilization of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.888" offset="5874918">Now, this district drew out its career until one time carried out extensive flood control jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.630" offset="5917863">Exhibit 5 is a 1953 Report from the present district that goes on for 20 or 30 pages on all the flood control things that it is done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.520" offset="5953494">And I have excerpt it and then printed in a trial -- a printed trial brief re-filed below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.252" offset="5980348">All the matters that pertained to flood control are not in the appendix but they are in a readily accessible form, should the Court wish to see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.540" offset="6017546">Finally, my learned friend, opposing Counsel Mr. Newell stated in his trial brief, a printed trial brief filed in the court below, that this district he represents is “an agency authorized by the North California to engage in a reclamation of water to reflect protection, drainage and irrigation works.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.369" offset="6108871">And I therefore take it that the flood control jurisdiction of this district is no longer a matter that’s open to question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.730" offset="6142307">That brings me to the major floods of the last 20 years which have led to this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.968" offset="6187238">Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District occupies a dry lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.626" offset="6205837">It’s dry in normal years, their dams on all four, all four the streams, the Kings, the Kern, the Tule, and the Kaweah.</text>

            <text syncTime="1538.493" offset="6257351">Water overflows this rich farmland and in 1906, 1917, 1938 -- 1937, 1938, 1952 and 1969, some more or greater portions of the district were flooded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.944" offset="6327150">1906 was a legendary year and so was 1969.</text>

            <text syncTime="1633.427" offset="6637066">There is a reference to consulting Engineer Hardy who was a professor, a very eminent professor and his eminence was stipulated too in the record, a leading authority on water matters in the San Joaquin Valley who told this district in effect your about to have a major flood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.059" offset="6699656">Now, Buena Vista Lake should fill the flood water of the Kern River before it comes down here to Tulare Lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.802" offset="6722539">Tulare Lake is still going to take flood water from three rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.288" offset="6736541">And so in 1952, they passed a resolution and it carried unanimously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.757" offset="6754408">It says so right here on the merits which are in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.996" offset="6767365">To have put those people on notice in the name of this district and the president was authorized to write a letter in the name of Tulare Basin Water Storage District to tell Buena Vista Lake to take that Kern River flood water before they turn it down on us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.667" offset="6814072">Take 235,000 acre feet of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.020" offset="6827447">The notice was given on 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.524" offset="6837478">Incidentally that was another example of the district exercising its flood control jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.662" offset="6858062">Well now, the notice was given on 52 and it was acquiesced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.040" offset="6879483">They couldn’t have done anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.385" offset="6884916">The geology of the San Joaquin Valley as such no one would claim that Kern River water should go anywhere other than into Buena Vista Lake first as higher up on the River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.036" offset="6927548">Well 17 years went by.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.188" offset="6936116">Another major flood was on its way in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.113" offset="6951790">The same situation exactly obtained except with one difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.805" offset="6966627">One crucial difference in that 17-year-period to wit in the year 1956, the J. G. Boswell Company had at lease all the Buena Vista Lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.748" offset="7014379">Well now, that wasn’t the legal difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.612" offset="7021798">That wasn’t the geological difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.735" offset="7030262">That wasn’t any difference at all as far as the law is concerned but it made an enormous difference in the 1969 flood, and that’s why I’m here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.669" offset="7065997">The appendix gives the whole story.</text>

            <text syncTime="1754.540" offset="7121481">“Please put Buena Vista Lake on notice again.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.353" offset="7132766">A 1,100,000 acre feet of water was on its way to Tulare Lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.740" offset="7150320">A 1,100,000 acre feet of water, I think actually another 69,000 came to Tulare Lake in the year 1969 and the district was formally petitioned by resolutions drawn by other public bodies notified Buena Vista Lake as you did before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.801" offset="7218552">Those 1952 notices have been effective and they have not been ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.153" offset="7248018">There was a meeting of this district on March 4, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.651" offset="7269961">The entire minutes are in evidence as exhibit 6 and portions to the minutes are excerpted in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.168" offset="7296084">There were 10 directors present, normally 11 but one of them had just died and there had have been a time enough yet to fill his vacancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.195" offset="7328162">Six of them were associated with the J. G. Boswell Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.685" offset="7346134">A motion was made fully set forth in the appendix to again give Buena Vista Lake interest notice, a motion -- the motion was made and it was immediately moved that that be tabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.419" offset="7405066">One Boswell Director moved that it be table in another second, and at that point, counsel appeared for the Boswell Company and what he said is in the minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.723" offset="7450311">It’s -- the excerpt is given on page 48 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.912" offset="7467029">That is a remarkable statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.001" offset="7479359">Able counsel for the Boswell Company was Mr. Clauster and the minute state as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.688" offset="7498167">Attorney Clauster at this point made disclosure for the record as the association of six of the directors of the J. G. Boswell Company indicating in some detail their stock ownerships and employee affiliations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.731" offset="7546337">And then he gives the six directors and he said stated further that he advised these directors, they were not disqualified to vote on the Buena Vista matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.960" offset="7579251">The motion to a table carried 6-4, Buena Vista Lake was given no notice in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.015" offset="7611434">One-fifth of the water that came into that lake -- into Tulare Lake in 1969 should have been at Buena Vista.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.707" offset="7638183">The crest to the water was 192.5, the residences, most of them, you can see from the topographical map which is exhibit 2 and 3 are both topographical maps, are around 177.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.018" offset="7691473">The level of that water was 15-1/2 feet over the homes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2038.918" offset="8259062">Mr. Chief Justice, thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.689" offset="8266167">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.161" offset="8272018">Let me take the last point of the first because that seems to be the motivating force behind this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.324" offset="8304619">The fact that the Buena Vista Lake is subject to a flood servitude is disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.146" offset="8323950">That is not a fact that this Court can take for granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.664" offset="8333981">Indeed, the most learned treaties I ever read on the subject was written by Mr. Greer when he represented the interest who preceded the J. G. Boswell Company and leasing Buena Vista Lake which includes there is no flood servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.549" offset="8377553">That’s not a matter that this Court can take for granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.447" offset="8389151">It can take for granted however what’s in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.081" offset="8399705">And in their brief, it’s just a footnote but the Court should note that this famous meeting in 1969 as indicated on page 28 of the appellant’s reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.929" offset="8443068">The general counsel of the district advised the district it did not have the power to bring the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.571" offset="8465638">The request was not to put Buena Vista Lake on notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.882" offset="8474937">It was a request to bring an action for an injunction which will represent a potential liability to this district as several million dollars that they lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.716" offset="8506284">Now this district can function over through the device of a district project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.362" offset="8524779">It’s important to understand its limited capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.277" offset="8536482">It isn’t the public district that can wheel and deal on governmental matters anytime it wants to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.791" offset="8554559">It can only act so that device of a district project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.915" offset="8566993">There is no district project that would born up the expenditure of that much money and that general counsel of the district advised the district of that fact on that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.259" offset="8600430">Both Mr. Greer and I were present at the meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.878" offset="8614849">Maybe that can be disputed but the matter of flood servitude in Buena Vista Lake is not something that involves the constitutional question in this Court, in my judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.890" offset="8650898">We’re dealing here with a district that operates to its district projects, four of which have been enacted in this district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.782" offset="8674513">That’s the important election and then to enact the district project requires the majority of the value of the land and a majority of the landowners voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.024" offset="8719444">And in our -- in the appendix, we have put for the Court, placed for the Court defendants exhibit R and S which are the ballots for the election on Project 4 which was a project to construct two laterals from the State Aqueduct to the west of Tulare Lake to the lake at a cost $2,500,000 and you vote twice, ballot A and ballot B, and to answer Justice Harlan’s questions to the prior case, these are formal elections conducted by board of election judges, secret ballot with all the formalities of any California election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.751" offset="8866356">And the ballots are twofold, you cast one for the number of votes you have in relation to assess values and one as a landowner so that Tomas J. Amos whose land is assessed at $10 value for Project four has just as many votes on the second ballot as does the J. G. Boswell Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.285" offset="8940544">It’s not what a 38,715 to 1, its one to one, in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.502" offset="8965413">So the California legislature has provided adequate protection for the small landowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.766" offset="8994461">Now that doesn’t answer the matter of lessees and residents, we’ll get to that in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.903" offset="9010970">But I object and ask the Court to examine the simplistic and syllogistic reasoning by which counsel for the appellants would suggest this case be reversed as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.938" offset="9047124">(a) In Avery versus Midland County, Justice White’s opinion, it stated on effect that any time a state exercises power to a local instrumentality of government and whether a popular elections, the one man, one vote rule applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.151" offset="9112012">(b) The Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District is a governmental entity, whatever that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.286" offset="9132492">Therefore, that the one man, one vote rule applies and that’s just not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.111" offset="9159868">In the one man, one vote cases, this Court has decided involving local elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.228" offset="9180244">The elections of concerned matters of interest to all of the populist, schools, sewers, police stations, libraries in Kolodziejski versus Phoenix, matters of general interest to the populist, to the electorate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.441" offset="9233115">And the Court has emphasized that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.304" offset="9240639">I don’t know why I’m lecturing this Court as a decision but that does obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.007" offset="9259447">And then secondly there is a statement that where the lien maybe is only on land but in fact the obligation is going to be paid by all of the citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.140" offset="9295914">Now the Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District is not that kind of an entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.881" offset="9318902">It is an entity created by a petition of land owners who can conduct projects for the benefit of the landowners and they pay for it exclusively.</text>
