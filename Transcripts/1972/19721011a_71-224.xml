            <label>Mr. Kenneth M. Romines</label>
            <text syncTime="29.837" offset="222751">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.659" offset="257964">This case is a habeas corpus case which originated in the Western District of Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.896" offset="282937">It involves a question concerning Jackson versus Denno and Sims versus Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.210" offset="308224">In 1955, Mr. Stidham was convicted for the first-degree murder of another inmate in a prison riot at the Missouri State Penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.082" offset="347721">The original conviction was affirmed by the Missouri Supreme Court in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.251" offset="376351">Mr. Stidham filed for collateral review pursuant to Missouri Supreme Court Rule 27.26 that was likewise affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.780" offset="414490">Second collateral review in 1967 was sought denied by the Circuit Court of Moniteau County, Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.826" offset="450644">The Missouri Supreme Court reversed and remanded for an evidentiary hearing and reinstated Mr. Stidham’s direct appeal in the spirit of Swenson versus Bosler which required counsel on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.436" offset="505083">Reaffirmed in 1970, Mr. Stidham sought habeas to the Western District of Missouri through Judge Collinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.654" offset="537997">Judge Collinson dismissed five separate grounds it was appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.685" offset="570075">The appeal was dismissed by Mr. Stidham, he tried to reinstate the appeal on the court did not allow the reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.967" offset="607274">He filed a second habeas corpus petition before Judge Collinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.170" offset="628067">Judge Collinson on relying upon the former opinion denied it and also denied a new issue involving Coleman versus Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.354" offset="668818">Of the five issues that then went to the Eighth Circuit, four were affirmed, one the Jackson v. Denno issue was found by two-to-one vote to be that the Eighth Circuit held that their review of Missouri case law demonstrated that the Missouri Trial Court had and frequently used the right to submit the question of voluntariness to the jury without a prior determination independently by the judge of voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.561" offset="813641">In essence, I feel that the Eighth Circuit clearly has held the Missouri rule as the same as in New York rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.813" offset="846660">Under Jackson which was struck down the judge could not exclude a confession, if there were circumstance which indicated testimony on both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.622" offset="901831">He was not entitled to exclude a confession merely because he himself would have found it involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.500" offset="933386">In essence, he was without judicial power to resolve the conflicting evidence on voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.643" offset="965987">This Court held that the defendant had the right at some point to a hearing and a determination on the issue of voluntariness and the Court expressed the opinion not to give the jury the dual function of deciding voluntariness and the factual history did not give the defendant constitutional determination that he was due.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.873" offset="1046862">Now because of the way that the Eighth Circuit read the Missouri procedure, we’ve dealt extensively with all cases beginning from 1829 when it became a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.203" offset="1088136">Hector a slave versus the State all the way through up to the most recent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.105" offset="1107780">Basically, I think distilling those cases indicates that the Missouri procedure contemplated a preliminary hearing outside the presence of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.237" offset="1148322">That at that hearing the State had the burden of non-persuasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.171" offset="1176012">After that hearing, the Court could waive the evidence and find the confession involuntary and refused to let it go to the jury; or the court could find the confession, competent evidence, instruct the jury on their duty to find that the confession was voluntary and instruct on their duty to find that if they find that if they found it was voluntary they then had the second determination to make whether they thought it was true and they believe it.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.312" offset="1292622">Now the Eighth Circuit quotes rather deafly I believe with the use of ellipsis from different cases in Missouri as their basic reasons for saying the Missouri procedure was bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.816" offset="1362631">One of those cases, State versus Bradford at the part in the opinion just before the court gets into what is admittedly equivocal language and it’s pretty difficult to determine exactly what the procedure is, the Missouri Supreme Court said this, “The Court is not obliged to submit the issue of voluntariness of a confession to a jury merely because there were substantial evidence tending to show the confession was voluntary, however much the evidence of its voluntary character is outweigh by the evidence to the contrary.”</text>
            <text syncTime="347.758" offset="1494392">Now after that portion follows some equivocal language which the court sets out which indicates that but the better rule is that, if there is a real close question, just let it go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.848" offset="1546742">Now, the question is what’s that mean and my answer is it’s pretty hard to tell.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.316" offset="1576626">I don’t believe it means exactly what the Eighth Circuit say.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.226" offset="1588328">I don’t believe that is the exact way the New York procedure worked and the other thing, the other case that leads me to that conclusion is State versus Gibraltar which they also quote, the court there says “that it is not the law that if there be any substantial evidence indicating the confession was voluntary the court must and the emphasis in our brief is the court’s emphasis must refer the question to the jury however much may be outweighed by evidence to the contrary.”</text>
            <text syncTime="400.459" offset="1705253">If that were true, the court would be doing no more that always does throughout the trial in ruling on the admissibility of evidence and there would be no need of such preliminary hearings except in the rare instances when such evidence is wholly likely.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.694" offset="1766170">Now, here is where the equivocation starts as it happened in the last case.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.956" offset="1787173">On the other hand, when there is substantial conflicting evidence and the question is closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.988" offset="1807339">It is better to refer the underlying issue of voluntariness to the jury than to exclude the confession and they go on with some language about miscarriage of justice if this is not done.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="437.475" offset="1853315">Is the basic issue in this case and the basic question, what was the law of Missouri in 1955 with respect to procedure in handling alleged course confessions?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth M. Romines</label>
            <text syncTime="450.648" offset="1905977">No sir, to the extent that might be the conclusion to be drawn from my questions, presumably that’s it.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.992" offset="1927293">I go one step further and said, “no matter what the law in Missouri might have been in 1955 we have to determine what this judge did on the facts before him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="469.006" offset="1979434">That is why I think the Eighth Circuit made a mistake, because if the Eighth Circuit was correct at the judge on the record find said “I make the finding that this confession was voluntary as a matter of law if the Eighth Circuit was correct” no matter that wouldn’t have been a proper finding.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="518.136" offset="2175875">That you say it is the basic issue.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth M. Romines</label>
            <text syncTime="518.914" offset="2179009">That’s right.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.932" offset="2183084">That I believe is a basic issue not necessarily so much what the Missouri procedure may or may not have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.376" offset="2208893">I meant that might be a nice intellectual inquire but frankly I am concerned that in this particular case that we hold or that the Court holds, that the procedure that this judge used, the words this judge used after the inquiry that was made was sufficient under Jackson versus Denno.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="542.566" stopTime="560.713">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="542.566" offset="2273677">Because that preliminary, that inquiry that what you interesting intellectual inquiry as to what was the law of Missouri in 1955 should I suppose you would agree normally in our judicial process be left for the determination by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_m_romines" startTime="560.713" stopTime="562.302">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth M. Romines</label>
            <text syncTime="560.713" offset="2346193">I think that’s correct.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="562.302" stopTime="565.118">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="562.302" offset="2352567">We are not in business here to decide what the state law is.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_m_romines" startTime="565.118" stopTime="808.621">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth M. Romines</label>
            <text syncTime="565.118" offset="2363852">No, in a particular case where the law is perhaps unclear as the Court indicates at least two members of the Court indicated they felt this was, perhaps that is a proper inquiry but I think on the particular reason that we’re here today that that’s not the proper inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.756" offset="2438353">Basically, I guess the most charitable thing, perhaps the worst thing that could be said for all these cases is that a basic general rule could not be established and the early cases up to about 1930 clearly indicate the judge made the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.140" offset="2503973">There are some equivocation and some of the cases after that and I think the -- especially if you read State versus Laster, you’ll find a case where the attorney comes in and he will not put on any evidence and so there up crops what’s called the prima facie rule which that puts language in the cases that the next time a judge uses, I don’t think the correct factual circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.826" offset="2614627">In this case, Mr. Hennelly who was a vigorous trial lawyer, as I believe, the transcripts will indicate requested of the judge a second judge coming in from another circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.411" offset="2685053">The case was being heard on a change of venue, I would say approximately 250 to 300 miles away from the State Penitentiary County that it is in.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.121" offset="2723819">He requested testimony on the confession, the hearing outside the presence of a jury that was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.915" offset="2755062">Now the language we specifically set out in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.377" offset="2776900">The first time that one of the officers gets up to testify about the confession, Mr. Hennelly indicates at this point Your Honor if it please, the defendant moves the court to conduct a preliminary hearing and asks the court to inquire to the voluntariness of the statement and to determine whether the statement was given voluntarily either the oral or the written statement and we ask that the hearing be held outside the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.463" offset="2865194">That was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.027" offset="2871463">Evidence was taken and covers pages 80-85 pages of the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.693" offset="2890167">All the officers testify, the defendants testifies and at the end of that Mr. Hennelly indicates that is all, that is the defendants motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.135" offset="2935933">Then the court’s language which has, perhaps what’s caused the confusion is now the conclusion of the hearing outside the hearing of the jury the request by the defendant for a hearing upon a statement which has been identified as 1616.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.932" offset="2983058">It is the court’s opinion that the matters concerning the statements should be offered in the presence of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.646" offset="3005942">Subject of course to any attacks as to its credibility by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.514" offset="3021406">The defendant has of course the right to proceed to challenge the voluntariness of the statements and confession even before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.352" offset="3052753">But it is the court’s opinion and upon the evidence that has been offered before the Court and outside the hearing of the jury that the statement is and should be admissible, then he follows with some other non-appropriate language.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.352" offset="3100818">Mr. Hennelly merely jumps off and says “in other words, the court is over ruling my motion.”</text>
            <text syncTime="754.923" offset="3123075">And request that the court to hold as a matter of law that these statements were involuntary is that right?</text>
            <text syncTime="760.243" offset="3144391">The court, “that is right.”</text>
            <text syncTime="762.267" offset="3152436">He brings him back in, now of course if you accept what the Eighth Circuit says the law was, that’s -- that can be read two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.777" offset="3182529">The one way, the way that we say it should be read.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.038" offset="3191515">The other way, the way Mr. Hennelly says it should be read to the extent that okay, he is equivocating.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.943" offset="3219101">If he was trying to make the decision as well as there is enough evidence here that may be ought not to rule it goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.827" offset="3242715">I think it’s clear from the judge’s actions here that he is saying “I don’t believe a word Stidham is saying.”</text>
            <text syncTime="793.531" offset="3277511">He has decided credibility, that’s what we are talking about in Jackson, has this man ever had the credibility of his voluntariness decided before the jury gets it in that mixed nature of trying to decide whether it is truthful and whether it happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="812.533" offset="3353475">Let’s assume that Jackson was violated or wasn’t followed or that the procedure that Jackson thinks a trial judge should follow wasn’t followed at the trial, the criminal trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1768.699" offset="7178219">The Court conducted a full preliminary hearing on the issue, found the issue for the jury and later after hearing evidence before the jury submitted the issue to the jury for determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1799.222" offset="7300263">The court should have done with respect to Jackson versus Denno and the Sims case, the court should have made a positive unquestioned finding and quite frankly, if Judge Godfrey when the case went back to him, if he would have done it that would have been the end of it too but to this day, nobody has made that finding except that the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has strongly suggested that it was totally involuntary and that it was taken and if we took the uncontradicted testimony that the confession was involuntary and should have been excluded as a matter of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2529.063" offset="10219604">Prior to giving a statement, Stidham had been confined in solitary confinement for 20 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.758" offset="10250428">This is the undisputed testimony to the solitary confinement had for the most part been on a cell measuring 5 feet x 7 feet with furnishings consisting of a wash basin, toilet, steel bunk and straw tick and an area infested with cockroaches and rodents and with ventilation so poor that Stidham passed out on several occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.538" offset="10337573">And I might tell the Court that in the original trial he told the court that the conditions in that penitentiary were so bad that the FBI had come to investigate it and at the time that we tried the post conviction motion in front of Judge Godfrey he said it again, and during all of that time there has been no attempt made to contradict that testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="2685.404" offset="10844975">I think I told the Court that he was impressive trial lawyer, he is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.321" offset="10868694">Two things I might mention, one on exactly what the Eighth Circuit did with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.983" offset="10899310">They sent it back for a hearing in the state court under Sigler versus Parker.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.702" offset="10922193">I am not sure that was correct because they did not indicate what new facts there are to be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.132" offset="10955943">It looks to me like there is sufficient record on both the original trial and the 27-26 to determine what all the facts were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.319" offset="10992619">I am not convinced as is Mr. Hennelly, some judge perhaps even this court under Boulden versus Holman could not just sit and look at the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.192" offset="11032116">I think clearly the Supreme Court of Missouri could take that cold record and on the authority under Boulden versus Holman and Jackson itself say this confession is voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.161" offset="11079973">Now as to what the Eighth Circuit said concerning the testimony, I believe that pages 770 and 771 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.742" offset="11122291">The court indicates that they are merely indulging themselves in Procunier versus Ashley which says that “if we were to believe Mr. Stidham’s facts, clearly he would be due some relief.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.599" offset="11189791">They’ve not said they believe him, all they said is that for the purposes of testing whether the five or six allegations he make on their face would grant him relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.014" offset="11235453">If they were true, we will not apply Procunier, we will send this back, we will not say it was involuntary and we will also not say that it was voluntary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2817.939" offset="11375156">I sent what I thought were appropriate transcript references back to him and also some fairly inflammatory argument as to exactly what they wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.303" offset="11416534">They were concerned about his testimonies to loss of weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.983" offset="11431267">He testified that and this is at the 27 and 26 now, he testifies that he lost 25 pounds during a six-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.384" offset="11468884">Then he testified that he was not given anything to eat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.432" offset="11485080">Other than that, they did not indicate in their letter for the most two things exactly what these other loose ends are and of course as we have indicated on a footnote you are going to have loose ends in every case that’s tried and certainly it is not the law that you have to present rebuttal testimony to every allegation a man makes before you can determine credibility, and that’s all that I think is basically involved there.</text>
