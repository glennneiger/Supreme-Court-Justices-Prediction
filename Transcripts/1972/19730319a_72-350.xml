            <text syncTime="17.119" offset="171865">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.909" offset="199032">Mississippi prohibited the sale or possession of alcoholic beverages until 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.291" offset="236544">In that year, it adapted a local County option policy, subject to requirement that the State Tax Commission be the sole importer and wholesaler of alcoholic beverages.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.025" offset="299447">The Commission promulgated a regulation which authorized military post exchanges and other military agencies to purchase liquor either from the Commission or directly from distillers, but required that the distillers collect from military and remit to the Commission a markup cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.859" offset="398817">The officers and non-commissioned officers' clubs and other non-appropriated fund activities had purchased liquor from out of state distillers and suppliers when Mississippi was a dry state, and they decided to continue this practice rather than purchase from the Commission itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.232" offset="492335">United States filed an action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the enforcement of this Mississippi regulation that required out of state distillers to collect a percentage sum, designated as a wholesale markup on their liquor sales to certain post exchanges and other military organizations.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="121.413" offset="588988">Has the military at any time made purchases directly from the State?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jewell_s_lafontant" startTime="125.368" stopTime="457.748">
            <label>Ms. Jewell S. Lafontant</label>
            <text syncTime="125.368" offset="604871">None whatsoever, not from any distillers in the State and never from the Commission itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.957" offset="631202">All of the purchases by the military, all of them had been made from out of state distillers, never from the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.018" offset="683447">So, the United States filed this action seeking declaratory judgment which said that, the markup had to be collected from the military and remitted to the State on basis in the State of Mississippi and also required the distillers to remit the markup to the Mississippi Tax Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.014" offset="779473">The United States, in addition to this, sought to recover the total of all such payments made by these military purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.429" offset="821060">Incidentally these payments were made under protest and by July 31st of 1971, the total payments made amounted to $648,421.92.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.665" offset="890023">The State of Mississippi ceded and the United States acquired jurisdiction over lands within the State, comprising the Keesler Air Force Base and the United States Naval Construction Battalion Center.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.759" offset="954389">Mississippi also ceded and the United States accepted concurrent jurisdiction over lands comprising the Columbus Air Force Base and Meridian Naval Air Station.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.606" offset="1009768">The court below decided against the United States, stating that the Twenty-First Amendment makes Mississippi Law applicable to the sales of liquor to the military bases and the Court entered a summary judgment in favor of the appellees on all issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.392" offset="1092942">In his opinion, the Court found and Mississippi conceded on Page 5 of its motion to affirm and dismiss that the United States had exclusive jurisdiction on two bases, namely Keesler Air Force Base and the United States Naval Construction Battalion Center, and in the opinion of the Court, the United States and Mississippi had concurrent jurisdiction on the other two, Columbus Air Force Base and Meridian Naval Air Station, and we accept the findings of that Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.177" offset="1256051">The Twenty-First Amendment regulates the importation of liquor into a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.707" offset="1286248">Section 2 of that Amendment provides the transportation or importation into any state of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors in violation of the laws thereof is hereby prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.592" offset="1361690">We submit that the mere finding of the lower court that the Government has exclusive jurisdiction means that the federal enclave is not within a State, but is a separate territory outside the ambit of the Twenty-First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.806" offset="1438595">The interpretation of the lower court that the Twenty-First Amendment makes Mississippi law applicable over the sales to the instrumentalities on the basis over which the United States has exclusive jurisdiction is inconsistent with the case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.253" offset="1508394">In Collins versus Yosemite Park, 304 U.S. 518, it was held that the regulatory phases of a California Law with respect to the importation and sale of intoxicating liquors are applicable to a corporation selling liquor in a national park, jurisdiction over which has been ceded to the United States with a reservation only of the right to tax persons and corporations in the ceded territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.065" offset="1639633">To the extent that the statute operates as purely tax or revenue measure, it was found that it was enforceable in the park.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.041" offset="1679548">However, license fees could not be enforced, because the state did not reserve the right to regulate or license, without I could say for the exception that it did reserve its right to issue license fees for fishing, but nothing concerning alcoholic beverages.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.209" offset="1768260">Thus, in Collins, California did not derive its right to impose revenue measures from the Twenty-First Amendment, but did so solely from its reservation of its right to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.587" offset="1829700">In this case, there was no reservation by Mississippi of the right to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.410" offset="1856972">Mississippi reserved only the right to serve civil and criminal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.449" offset="1885184">A proper application of Collins would defeat Mississippi’s claim of any right to impose any taxes of a regulatory or revenue nature or any taxes whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="1016.220" offset="4168286">No one has any question about the fact that this money is collected specifically to be submitted to the State of Mississippi and is collected from the purchasers itself, and there is -- and then its put in the general revenue fund of the State, and the State does nothing to receive this money.</text>

            <text syncTime="1353.250" offset="5516413">The tax here is imposed upon governmental instrumentalities, the United States army post exchange and various clubs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.705" offset="5550164">The Supreme Court in 1942 in Standard Oil versus Johnson 316 U.S. 481, the question was settled that army post exchanges are instrumentalities of the United States, and army post exchanges are out of non-appropriate funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.693" offset="5630098">Mr. Justice Black said there that post exchanges are arms of the Government, deemed by it as essential for the performance of governmental functions and partake of whatever immunities the armed services may have under the Constitution and the federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.486" offset="5705331">The reasoning of the Johnson case has been extended to include military messes and officers clubs in many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.723" offset="5754232">The fundamental principle that federal instrumentalities are immune from state taxation was first stated in McCulloch versus Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.926" offset="5795088">That principle is deeply rooted in the concept of federalism and has not been abrogated to this date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.850" offset="5830823">For all of these reasons and the reasons set out in our brief, we respectfully submit that the judgment of the court below should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.514" offset="5877426">Thank you, very much.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert L. Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="1452.047" offset="5911594">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.640" offset="5925909">I am going to first describe to you the Mississippi policy toward military sales of liquor and then describe the federal policy toward those sales and finally discuss this Court’s decisions that accommodate State and Federal liquor control policies with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.275" offset="6024443">Now Mississippi’s policy is as has been pointed out to preempt for itself all profits made from the wholesale distribution of distilled spirits and wine within its own borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.882" offset="6086928">Now Mississippi also imposes an annual privilege tax of $900 on package retailers and excises taxes on all sales, varying from 35 cents a gallon on wine to two-and-a-half dollars a gallon on distilled spirits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.233" offset="6176266">Now, the states give, the State gives to the military retailers, these are the clubs and by the way those are all stipulated to be non-appropriated instrumentalities of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.355" offset="6232795">There is no question about either fact that they operate in non-appropriated funds and that they are instrumentalities of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.778" offset="6266441">Now, the State gives to those military retailers, the option of ordering direct from the distillers without payment of any state taxes, providing only that the state's wholesale markup is collected and remitted to the State by the distiller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.450" offset="6345122">Now, the markup districts administratively by the Commission in accordance with the statuary direction to cover the cost of operation of a state's wholesale liquor business, yield a reason of a profit, and be competitive with liquor prices in neighboring states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.896" offset="6426937">During the period here involved, that markup by the spirits was 17% to 22% on wine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.605" offset="6461837">Now that markup was applied uniformly throughout the State, selling to all retailers in the State, and the effect of the military tax exemption, however, was to give the military retailers a price on whiskey and gin that was 50 cents cheaper than the private retailers pay, because the excise tax exemption amounts to two-and-half dollars a gallon on spirits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.469" offset="6569253">The military retailers were also exempted from the $900 a year privilege tax not paid by the private retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.320" offset="6604675">Now the net effect of the State's regulation is that the military clubs are guaranteed a price on the distilled spirits that is no more than 17% above the price at which distilled spirits are sold in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.661" offset="6674056">This 17% markup, that's State's gross profit margin, that their income to the State from the market is the difference between the markup and what it costs the State to maintain its wholesale distribution system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.511" offset="6741452">Now that cost is substantial because it involves stocking and warehousing, a very large inventory of wine and spirits statewide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.096" offset="6787741">Now the cost to this, carry that inventory, has to borne by the State, whether the military chooses to buy direct from it or direct from suppliers and in accordance for the options given to the military for their convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.836" offset="6858689">Now when military orders are sent direct to the suppliers, he supplies, of course, to perform the wholesaling functions that the State normally performs, and to remit the State's normal wholesale market to the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="1724.628" offset="7001840">We had cited the Yosemite, the Collins against Yosemite Park case, which held exactly that as far as California’s excise tax is concerned, but I will get to that case later on, I want to describe here first how the Mississippi system operates and then I will describe how the federal policy operates, because after you see how the federal system and state system perform, I don’t think you will find any conflict that would force you to reach the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.486" offset="7137364">Now, when the military orders are sent direct to the suppler, he has to perform those wholesaling functions, but the State, the military clubs, the United States never performs these wholesaling functions, whether it buys direct from the distiller or whether it buys -- whether it chose to buy from the State, in neither event, would the United States or the clubs, perform the wholesaling functions for which markup is charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.391" offset="7272887">Now the application of this markup to direct sales prevents the distiller from adding more than 17% to his wholesale price when he sales to military retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.442" offset="7337148">That's the same ceiling that applies, of course, to the sales that are made by the State to the retailers because of the fixed 17% markup.</text>

            <text syncTime="2029.778" offset="8222490">No it's not all state taxes are exempted, the military clubs are exempted from all state taxes, that's the same sentence in the regulation that imposes the market exempts from all state taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.473" offset="8285288">But now, any distiller, even a private one, knows it, none of his wholesale, if he has an exclusive wholesale distributor, whether he is public or private, the wholesale distributor can't be expected to tolerate direct sales that made by the manufacturer that under cut his profit, collecting and remitting a wholesaler's or an exclusive wholesaler's markup to him on direct sales made for the convenience of a purchaser is common industry practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.501" offset="8449337">Now at the trial no effort was made by the United States to show that after Mississippi's regulations, any of the effected military clubs could have bought liquor from any supplier at a lower price than they actually pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.197" offset="8528123">From the nature of the regulation, I think you could see that no such choise was possible, unless you assume that some supplier wanted to penetrate the military market could validly offer special inducements that would have fit to only principles of full State and federal regulation of the liquor traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.887" offset="8614954">Now coming to the federal regulation, federal liquor control policy, unlike Mississippi, is centered around practices and have no special bearing on activities within any State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.264" offset="8672423">However, in some aspects federal control is more decisive than state control when it comes to price, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.389" offset="8712965">The major part of an average cost, the average price of distilled spirits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.891" offset="8734908">So anywhere in United States is a federal excise tax, that's $10.50 on every gallon 100 spirits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.536" offset="8773465">These mean that roughly half of the wholesale price even the best by the government as federal excise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.540" offset="8805543">Now if the Congress thought as the convention that's made here that making some military raft requires low liquor prices, it could cut the club prices in to half by simply providing the federal excise tax refund to military persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.059" offset="8883597">Now, the Congress has been asked by the Defense Department to solve its moral problems that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.911" offset="8915048">The only federal legislation now on the books dealing with military liquor is the 1951 law that's afforded in the Appendix here In full, and that statute is -- it says that two cents is the sole authority of the Defense Department of regulations that put the military in the business of selling liquor at retail.</text>

            <text syncTime="2232.133" offset="9031868">Now what this does on its face, I am talking about the 1951 federal act is authorized the Defense Department to make regulations governing sales to or buy members of the arm forces at or there any military base, any base.</text>

            <text syncTime="2404.430" offset="9721083">The law's entire legislative history is found on one page of congressional record stated in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.223" offset="9748250">Now that was adopted as an amendment to the Extension Act of 1951 by agreement just before the House passed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.916" offset="9783045">That amendment was proposed by Representative Cole of New York as a substitute for one proposed by Representative Price from South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.980" offset="9827244">The Price's amendment would have made every base where draftees were trained bone dry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.679" offset="9854098">Cole said his amendment was preferable, because there would not be regulations made by the secretary apply to all bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.944" offset="9891192">Price's said that -- it was agreeable to him, Cole's amendment was adapted without any debate without the quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.040" offset="9927555">Now you should also remember that three years before the Federal Assimilative Crimes Act had been enacted in 1948, which made state crimes punishable as federal crimes when committed inside federal enclaves where there is exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction, and subsequently all state liquor laws were then as they are now enforceable by criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.025" offset="10059421">Now no mention of those laws was made by Cole or by Price or anyone else when this 1951 federal regulations was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.494" offset="10093380">Now whatever else Congress may have had to do by that 51 law, it certainly didn't intend to make military bases payments for bootleggers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.879" offset="10138937">Now here is the term bootlegger, because since the Twenty-First Amendment, that's word that describes the activities of people who sell liquor without payment of taxes etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.958" offset="10195153">Now the Defense Department itself construed this law that I just described as not requiring avoidance of state regulations of sales to military bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.959" offset="10243218">When it amended its own regulations in June 1966, that was just before Mississippi’s regulation became effective, the federal amendment struck out the requirement that the base purchases be made “without regard to prices locally established by state statutes or otherwise”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.994" offset="10335378">It continued to enforce its requirement that its own sales of packaged liquor be priced “within 10% of the lowest prevailing rates of civilian outlets in the area".</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.882" offset="10402879">Now, I think it's quite clear on the face of the regulations themselves and the statutes, there is no genuine conflict between federal and Mississippi liquor control policies as they are expressed in their respective laws and regulations in those policies in both cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2827.311" offset="11412668">Well, even if you regard it a conflict as present, I think your decisions, the Court’s decision in Ohio against Helvering and in Collins against Yosemite Park decides this case in favor of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.769" offset="11482467">Now in 1934 Ohio’s attorney general thought the moral of Ohio citizens would be a proof if they went to federal excise tax is -- liquor sales could be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.363" offset="11536802">Now, following the Twenty-First Amendment, Ohio preempted for itself didn't it suppose to selling, wholesaling liquor within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.898" offset="11570970">Now, Ohio argued that since it had gone into the liquor business itself there is both the control over revenue and measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.127" offset="11599914">The sale of liquor in Ohio was a sovereign function that could not be impaired by federal action, and they claim that the federal excise tax was such an unconstitutional impairment, because it did enormously increase the prices that the state had to pay for the liquor itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.757" offset="11682356">Now this Court as far as to Ohio's argument was refusal to allow Ohio's point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.643" offset="11709942">The opinion simply observed that while Ohio could enter the liquor business with a state monopoly, it could only do so subject to normal non-discriminatory business taxation and all you have here is normal imposition of a markup, which is discriminatory only inside of the clubs, because when we markup does apply to military service, all taxes are away, but when applied to the private clubs, the excise tax has to be paid which gives them a much higher per case price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.028" offset="11887470">Now four year later in the Yosemite Park case, a liquor selling concession here at the park service tried to avoid the payment of the California excise tax on his liquor sales and couldn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.876" offset="11958836">Now, he argued that he was the an agent of the Federal Government, operating in an enclave where the United States had exclusive jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.865" offset="11998856">Now this Court held that that the concession area that they have take out a retailer's permit or pay California's tax on retailers, and Mississippi is not attempting to force these clubs either to take out retailer's permit or pay that retailer's tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.307" offset="12080567">The Court also held, however, that the Yosemite Park in cession did have to pay California’s Excise Tax, levied on all liquor sold “within the state”, because within the state meant anywhere within the state’s boundaries whether on a Federal enclave or elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.773" offset="12170428">Now the Court noted that California reserved taxing power when the Park was conceded to the government in 1990, but that doesn’t explain the, sticks to truth, between the retailer's tax and the Excise Tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.201" offset="12236152">Now, California has treated that 1938 decision as authorizing application of its excise tax to all liquor sales to military bases within the state, and the United States has never challenged that construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.722" offset="12310235">Now, California gives liquor wholesalers no excise tax exemption on sales made to non-appropriated fund agencies selling liquor on military bases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3118.994" offset="12579297">All I am saying is that since that time, California has enacted legislation which applies its tax not only to sales to non-appropriated fund instrumentalities, at all the bases in the state and without regard to the charge of cession or without regard to what taxing rights, if anyway they were reserved on the cases were ceded, and that California also gives no excise tax exemption to distillers outside the state who sell direct to military installations where payment is made out of the Federal Treasury and the US has never attacked California’s right to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.024" offset="12763512">Now, in 1947, a distiller did litigate the matter however.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.266" offset="12784410">National Distillers tried to avoid payment of the tax on the sale of 41000 (Inaudible) whiskey (Inaudible) for distill purposes and sent to army medical depot in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.891" offset="12850970">Now that whiskey was ordered out of the St. Louis and shipped to Los Angeles from Ohio and the distiller argued that the application of the California excise tax to that shipment creates an unconstitutional burden on federal functions, because the tax was included in the price the army paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.177" offset="12944071">Now, the California Appellate Court rejected the distiller’s argument and sustained the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.674" offset="12974059">That case is cited on the Page 17 of our brief in Footnote 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.486" offset="12993285">Now, the US could have intervened in that case and carried it to this Court on the constitutional issue, but it didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.280" offset="13028498">What it's doing now, is asking you to overturn a construction of that 1938 decision in Yosemite Park that was regarded as settled until this case was brought against Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.360" offset="13080848">Now, if there is only solid policy reason for doing that, I haven't heard of expressed into government's argument, haven't seen in its brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="3271.239" offset="13188368">It seems to me at least possible that a distiller is either an indispensable party or perhaps the only party here who can raise this type of an issue that the government has made these payments to the distillers.</text>
