            <text syncTime="405.435" offset="1725106">As indicated, the hearing, the legislative hearing before the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control developed the effective alcohol upon persons imbibing in it and also developed through the testimony of various Law enforcement officials in California through department of investigators that the sex -- this type of sexually oriented entertainment is provided on premises where alcoholic beverages were sold and consumed on the premises, that the resultant problems on such premises, including overt sexual act between the employees and the entertainers and the customers, B girl activity, as indicated by officials from San Francisco Police Department, where in 1964 they had almost come to nil on B Girl activity, the introduction of the sexually oriented entertainment in On Sale bars in San Francisco and college B Girl activity to reach almost epidemic proportions.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.095" offset="2003780">Prostitution increased around such premises where you have this mixture, the prostitutes congregating where you have this sexually oriented entertainment, sexually stimulating entertainment plus the customers imbibing in alcoholic beverages.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.228" offset="2072325">Narcotic and drug problems increased at or near such premises, violent crimes, exploitation of customers, overt sex crimes, (Inaudible) and temperance, serious and extensive law enforcement problems, we have set out in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.627" offset="2149857">Accordingly the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control adopted these regulations in order to try and prevent these serious problems and offenses that were occurring on the licensed alcoholic beverage premises in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.030" offset="2215476">As indicated, the regulations were tacked by various licensees in Los Angeles and Southern California area, both in State and Federal Courts, and when the State Courts refused to entertain these cases the three-judge Federal District Court in Los Angeles heard the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.829" offset="2294680">On a two to one decision, the lower Court held, relying on Roth and other obscenity cases, decisions by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.648" offset="2337938">The Lower Court held that the sexual acts and conducts and this visual displays that were prescribed by the department regulations were protected expression under the First Amendment and that the State could regulate them only on the grounds of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.700" offset="2414216">That in is much as the department regulations did not deal with obscenity, they did not require standards of proof as to obscenity, the regulation must fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.995" offset="2459355">In addition, we would note that its clear, if one reads a lower court's decision, that they took the position that regardless of the alleged purpose of the department in enacting regulations that they assumed and determined that the department's motive was to circumvent the obscenity laws and not to try and prevent the problems which the legislative record had shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.820" offset="2566666">The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control argument is three-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.347" offset="2584743">First that the sexual activities and sexual conduct regulated by these regulations are not and do not constitute symbolic speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.106" offset="2627793">They are not and do not constitute expression and are not within the protection of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.433" offset="2657155">Secondly that even if this Court should determine that they are within the First Amendment, that a state may regulate the First Amendment activity on grounds or interest other than obscenity; that obscenity is not the sole touchstone the state is required to use in attempts to regulate First Amendment activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2484.074" offset="10039672">We would submit further that the way rules are drafted, they are overbreadth the Smith versus California problem which Mr. Scholtz will take up with the Court, are such that or in a manner that they do deny the licensees herein the proper exercise, the licensees and the dancer plaintiffs, the proper exercise of their First Amendment rights as a condition to the owning of a liquor license, no different than NAACP versus Button and those line of cases requiring the foregoing of an old etcetera to maintain the license.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.770" offset="10262444">That's the basis of our argument herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.073" offset="10279685">The District Court below said that if it is not obscene then something is wrong with it and they can't take your license away because obscenity has been the standard since 1957, decided by this Court in Roth, but to accept these rules taking things out of context and merely saying if an act simulates, an act that simulates, whatever that may be, that's grounds for disciplinary proceeding even if it is in a picture on the wall because it involves movies, still pictures and entertainment of any kind of nature whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.658" offset="10469961">The injunction granted in the Federal District Court in this case, specifically accepted any contact between any entertainer and any patron, person in the bar which are 90% of the pray to horribles listed in the briefs, in the briefs of the appellant herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.742" offset="10578317">We submit that from time immemorial, dancing, entertainment of that kind as this Court said in Stanley versus Georgia the line is too illusive to draw between conveying ideas and entertainment that whether it is vulgar, whether it is refined, whether it is ugly or whether it is elegant receive the same protection and that test the obscenity test as has been laid down so strong and hard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.093" offset="10711751">To sustain the rules in this case would take us back to Hicklin, prior to Roth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.862" offset="10778833">The activity, dancing is direct communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.624" offset="10817912">This is not as I previously said an O'Brien case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.261" offset="10836407">In O'Brien, this Court held that when speech and non-speech elements are combined in the same course of conduct, a sufficiently governmental interest in regulating the non-speech element can just defy incidental limitations on First Amendment freedoms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.515" offset="10905475">But, the Court further went on in O'Brien and stated, referring to Stromberg versus California, the red flag waving case, since the statue there, in San Bernardino, California was aimed at suppressing communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.610" offset="10965765">It could not be sustained as a regulation of non-communicative conduct, citing Brandenburg versus Ohio which came later, Brandenburg versus Ohio which required the incitement to action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.650" offset="11025951">We submit that the conduct here, or the content of the conduct here cannot be changed from speech to symbolic speech or non-speech merely by changing the name.</text>

            <text syncTime="2769.688" offset="11182164">Mr. Chief Justice and may please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.051" offset="11195538">I think that it is clear this case involves a conflict between the state's police power to control alcohol and the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.459" offset="11225213">I think it is clear that these rules would be over-broad, over-broad and vague under the First Amendment, if there were no question of alcohol involved and that they prohibit -- well I could list, I can tick off a list of movies that couldn't be shown in a bar under these rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.828" offset="11290728">The Catch 22, Summer of 42, I could tick off a list of master works of arts including probably half of the output of Picasso that couldn't be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.515" offset="11329390">So, let me ask a rhetorical question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.181" offset="11340048">Could a state require bars to be racially segregated, after holding hearing wherein police officers testify that fights between persons of opposites races are more likely to occur when they are drinking, and therefore, the state says that bars are required to be racially segregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.260" offset="11420400">I say it could not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.028" offset="11427506">That would an impermissible conflict between the Fourteenth Amendment and the state's police power over alcohol.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.783" offset="11458539">Similarly, I think in this case the state cannot make an unconstitutional discrimination against exercise of First Amendment rights simply because alcohol is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.757" offset="11522382">To respond to Mr. Justice Burger's question at the beginning, let me distinguish this between a rule that says a bar cannot be located say within 600 feet of a Church as California does. California says, you cannot put a bar within 600 feet of a Church.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.834" offset="11590719">The California does not say and I submit it, it could not say that you cannot put a Church within 600 feet of a bar and California does not say if you have a bar in a place and a Church comes in within 600 feet that the bar has to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.867" offset="11654875">Because I would also say this that the rule respecting for example, distance to Churches is intended to protect the persons who go to the Churches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.736" offset="11698343">These rules are intended and expressly intended to control what the people do inside the bar without regard to where it is located without regard to what effect it may have on anyone else outside the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.878" offset="11766888">So, there is a clear distinction here between this type of a rule which directly applies to the conduct inside of a bar which directly restricts what can go on inside a bar.</text>

            <text syncTime="2946.808" offset="11890604">In other words it is similar to a state saying no liquor shall be sold while they drink in a Church.</text>
