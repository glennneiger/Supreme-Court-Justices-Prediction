            <label>Mr. Robert G. Dixon, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="38.374" offset="256920">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.281" offset="268518">This case is here on direct appeal from a three-judge District Court in Connecticut which invalidated the official state legislative enforcement plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.309" offset="300596">We appear here in defense of that official state plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.098" offset="315747">The plan was devised by a bipartisan board of three members including a tie-breaker under the state constitution which constitution thereby tries to incorporate an anti-gerrymandering spirit in the very reprocess of the apportionment activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.528" offset="381471">The plan of the board was subjected to litigation promptly in both state and federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.802" offset="402578">The federal court denied a plea of extension and on April 4, 1972, he did invalidate that plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.802" offset="434552">An appeal was promptly taken and also a submission of a motion for a stay order, the motion was referred by Mr. Justice Marshall to the Court and on June 12, 1972, this Court stayed the adverse District Court judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.383" offset="500903">That had two effects. One was to bar implementation of a Master’s plan which had been under preparation, under now stayed judgment and more importantly perhaps and also on the way for conducting the 1972 election of state legislators in Connecticut under the official state plan, that was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.801" offset="582614">Along the way, there was a supplementary mandamus action in state court to clarify one or two clerical errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.567" offset="609677">The claim was reviewed by the state court and the State Supreme Court found that no constitutional impediment under the state constitution to use of the state plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.569" offset="645622">The large question therefore here is whether Connecticut can continue the use of this official state reinforcement plan, gerrymander of the 1970 decade.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.260" offset="680417">In a more precise fashion, the federal issues are three, population equality, justification of deviations as such be needed and the plaintiff-appellees’ allegations of gerrymandering.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.748" offset="730363">Turning first to the population issue, we assert, and most strongly assert that trivial deviations of the sort in Connecticut and I’ll mention those in a second, trivial deviations present no prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.561" offset="797654">Therefore, the plan would remain presumptively constitutional unless plaintiff-appellees could introduce proof of a non-population nature of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.773" offset="838510">We think that a concept of a presumptive constitutionality concept keyed to a lack of a prima facie case, if there are trivial deviations is implicit in Swann against Adams, and was not settled in Swann against Adams and is implicit in the dissented opinions in Kirkpatrick against Preisler.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.097" offset="915728">What are these Connecticut deviations which we find so trivial?</text>
            <text syncTime="209.723" offset="942268">In percentage terms, the most deviant district from ideal in the Connecticut Senate deviates by only 0.9%.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.968" offset="983228">For the Lower House, most deviant district from ideal deviates by only 3.9%.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.191" offset="1012172">Over these percentage terms, must be put in a context of the size of the district being created to become meaningful and likewise the available census data we look to the census data.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.048" offset="1055535">We find that the most deviant district in either house in Connecticut deviates from ideal by fewer than 800 census-persons, for the Lower House, 789, for the Senate 787.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.613" offset="1125857">You might well ask if the population deviation in real census terms is identical virtually why a percentage -- or the percentages is so different, the answer is in the size of the districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.508" offset="1173400">Connecticut has 36 State Senate seats, average population, 84,000 roughly, 800 population deviants, census body is deviant on that base because there’s only 0.9% deviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.958" offset="1227212">Connecticut has 151 assembly districts, average population about 20,000 on that base the same trivial 800 person deviation, gives you only a -- since they raise the percent deviation to a 3.9%.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.955" offset="1291160">In terms of the census data which was the building unit for the apportionment board of the 2,700 census units available to the board, 88% in exceed 400 in census population and yet the average deviation in Connecticut in either House is under 400.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.854" offset="1394813">By contrast, Howell against Mahan -- Mahan against Howell last week, excuse me, the most deviant district from ideal was I believe was about 4,400.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.953" offset="1439222">The figures of the Connecticut type, we suggest are really on target in the Reynolds against Sims sense of substantial equality or of not -- or in showing that the vote of each voter in a state, be approximate or equal to that of any other on target and therefore constitute no dilution of voting power.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.518" offset="1517484">Hence we suggest that this case could fit the general principle of treating trivial deviations of this sort as constituting no prima facie case of dilution of voting power as being presumptively constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.603" offset="1573804">More precisely and we’ve suggest this for Connecticut and not for the nation necessarily about a rule if we divide as follows for Connecticut making more precise this presumptive constitutionality concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.760" offset="1626363">It could run this way that where the maximum deviation in census population terms, actual census bodies in a district, in most deviant district, in a state plan is less than the average population of the census units being constructed, that plan should be presumptively constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.767" offset="1726464">And the average population of the census units in Connecticut is 1,100, the median unit, census unit is 1,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.762" offset="1762408">And as I said the most deviant actual district from ideal is only 800.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.029" offset="1783515">Without such a presumptive constitutionality rule keyed to lack of showing a prima facie case with trivial deviations of this sort, we feel the Courts remain not only in the business of stirring up the political thicket, that plaintiff instigation that may take up residence in a permanent basis in the political thicket.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.382" offset="1864913">Why do we say this? Because plaintiffs can always show a slightly less deviant plan then laboriously constructed official state plan at any given level of the percentage deviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.955" offset="1931160">With a hand calculator, you could device hundreds of plans, each one though having a quite different political effect because no district line is neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.709" offset="1970239">Lower courts have tended to follow this approach in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.343" offset="1980792">In fact we’re having a past and we’re still today to an extent a one body better rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.969" offset="2007228">That is plaintiff’s comment with the plan often to the last minute at trial perhaps showing their own self serving plan, just no statewide input in it, showing it is one body better so to speak than the state plan and if it -- that the election is immanent and the state cannot justify or hasn’t built under the -- its process, the state plan goes down the drain.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.749" offset="2114330">Now, Mahan against Howell last week, that does not solve this problem of avoiding casual invalidations on a one body better rule because the state which has tried to be directly on target and does not crank into its process any corollary rational state purposes than an attempt to be directly on target in population could not qualify to utilize the Mahan against Howell justifications process.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.940" offset="2215163">However with -- what we do -- I refer to here is a presumptive constitutionality rule, keyed a very low deviations of this sort, we will achieve some legislative certainty, the bodies can apportion without the sense of futility as often been the case in the last several years, litigation have been massive as we all know even after 1970 census.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.324" offset="2316622">As far as courts are concerned of this approach a finding that there is no prima facie case with low deviations of this sort, trivial deviations would flush out many petty cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.846" offset="2370748">Reserved court time for those cases for justification does seem needed because the size of the deviation or for the more complex issue of gerrymandering if the court proceeds in that direction.</text>

            <text syncTime="716.198" offset="2968116">That would depend upon Mr. Justice Stewart, depend upon the rational state policy at issue and I think that is an next logical consideration for the Connecticut case.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.682" offset="3018062">We have sought not merely to achieve population equality directly on target as a pre-eminent goal in order to serve the overall purpose of fair and defect in representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.247" offset="3068322">I mentioned several times Reynolds against Sims.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.560" offset="3077622">We have also added two corollary policies which we think would support this plan under the decision of Mahan against Howell last week.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.553" offset="3117537">In short, if we do not prevail on a theory of presumptive constitutionality because deviations are very trivial, then there are the following justifications to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.180" offset="3172080">The Apportionment Board seeking close population equality also had two corollary policies, a Connecticut town policy and a policy of political balance or fairness which I’ll define in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.956" offset="3227146">Now turning first to the town policy which is the analogue of the no-county line policy in Mahan against Howell last week, we find that where Virginia could honor that fully and still stay inside a top to bottom variation of 16%.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.308" offset="3296632">The Connecticut sought to honor its town -- its no-town line cut fully for the Lower House, it does not apply to the Senate but for the Lower House.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.026" offset="3331427">The population deviations would reach a 111% if we bring forth the 1965 plan, and cut no-town lines and test it out under the 1970 census.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.103" offset="3379806">110%, 11% is way beyond Howell against Mahan even if we think a no-cut policy is good.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.226" offset="3412302">We do think that -- an important to note, the purposes lying behind is no local division line cuts in order to see if they can be served by some other premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.616" offset="3473847">Mahan against Howell last week, speaking of the Virginia county policy, analogous to the no-cut policy in Connecticut, said that it served the purpose of furthering a political voice for the counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.550" offset="3537586">We see in this a judicial recognition of community of interest factor in representation that also spoke of the no-cut policy asserting an important anti-gerrymandering function.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.290" offset="3588577">We see in this a judicial recognition of the danger of blind or invidious line drawing.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.071" offset="3615640">The apportionment board in Connecticut honored the town -- the no town line cut policy substantially.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.766" offset="3650435">Approximate 3/4 for the line of the towns are not cut.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.101" offset="3663809">The board cut 47 towns out of 169.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.442" offset="3685125">It then -- seeking to serve -- preserve the substance if not the latter on all cut policy and the purposes of political voice and of anti-gerrymandering used a complementary policy of political fairness or political balance which requires some definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.123" offset="3759835">This political balance or political fairness policy but that is found.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.135" offset="3779897">The board with knowledge of public voting patterns in past elections tried to divide equal population districts which would and knowing out of hope of avoiding the minority election, it actually occurred in 1970 in Connecticut but would actually -- of our hope of providing each party with a seat gain, the legislature approximately proportionate to its percent or total of -- percent total of popular vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.514" offset="3893478">Now a functional trend -- you’ll see this is being a vital arrogant, anti-gerrymandering principle and an attempt to safeguard a political opportunity for effective political action by all of the voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.086" offset="3947708">The essence of this political fairness or political balance principle uses a corollary of principle where they attempt to cut no town lines and they only cut 3/4, I know it would become -- what they felt with the on target in equality terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.265" offset="4008417">The assessment says, “A direct turning away from a gerrymandering purpose, one other result from the plan that was achieved.”</text>
            <text syncTime="985.178" offset="4044048">We think that in regarding 1966 to 1970 election data, the plan is conceitedly fair, demonstrably so.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.776" offset="4074454">Regarding 1972, we would suggest that it is also demonstrably fair, all class before the Court.District Court, would’ve achieved somewhat the same outcome in 1972 under all plans, it would’ve been an excess seat gained for Republican Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.784" offset="4150523">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.637" offset="4153971">Because that was a landslide election here in Connecticut and past election data in Connecticut and indeed a civil law of political science indicates that when you have a landslide election, the seat gained runs substantially ahead of the percent of the -- of vote cast.</text>

            <text syncTime="1238.081" offset="5055718">My last point as to mention the plaintiff-appellee's gerrymandering argument, they do allege that the plan is a gerrymander of an invidious sense that we see in this record not one iota of proof regarding the standards suggested in Whitcomb against Chavis following on that from Fortson against Dorsey for attacks on plans on an impact basis rather than a population basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.183" offset="5180061">This Court said in Whitcomb that when that kind of claim is made there must a showing that the districts were conceded or operated as purposeful devices to further discrimination, racial economic, you can say a fortiori political fits that that principle and the proof on Whitcomb must be real life proof of impact on -- in view of voting power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.665" offset="5286013">So in short we suggest that at one level we have a plan with deviation, somewhat trivial that should be deemed to be presumptively constitutional, absent a gerrymandering type proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.775" offset="5338467">That is not thought to be the case, not figured enough and we’ll suggest too rational state policy to justify the deviations preserving as many town lines as possible or about 3/4 and also making a good faith attempt to avoid unfairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.929" offset="5411088">And last we find no evidence at all here of any overt invidious gerrymandering of the sort which this Court has spoken of in Whitcomb against Chavis in similar cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1388.495" offset="5657370">And as this Court said in Reynolds to the extent that a citizen -- the citizens’ right to vote is debased, he is that much less a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.648" offset="5705958">And so these one man one vote cases are important and they put us on a high road toward improving the quality of our democracy and the passion and the high hopes with which this Court started that journey with Baker against Karr should not play and particularly it should not play in light of how close we are to an ultimate success.</text>

            <text syncTime="1723.423" offset="6997034">The Reynolds case established the standard of equality as equal, as practicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.024" offset="7019499">There is no question that it had some caveats in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.856" offset="7034755">It’s expressly stated that absolute maximum exactness or precision was not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.856" offset="7062758">And taking the very tolerant approach that appeared to be implicit in the Reynolds decision, the Courts replied and in the period after 1964, the pattern of approved deviation in state legislative cases ranged substantially above 15%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.615" offset="7165785">And in fact, our record shows that prior to 1969, 88% of our states had deviations of over 15% with respect to their Senate and 96% had deviations with respect to their House of over 15%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.648" offset="7253974">And then came Kirkpatrick, fortuitously in 1969, prior to the 1970 census and prior to the time when the vast majority of the states had to reapportion and the Kirkpatrick decision had two parts to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.471" offset="7325236">The first part was that the standard of equality was going to be strict as equal as practicable manner that the states had to seek to achieve precise mathematical equality and they were to be permitted only those deviations in which the variations were unavoidable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.461" offset="7409246">And the second aspect of it was that virtually all excuses or justifications at least as applied to congressional reapportionment, were going to be ruled out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.966" offset="7463267">And the states listened to that and they knew that this Court meant what it was saying and they felt that they had to apply those rules in the Kirkpatrick case to their own state legislative reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.529" offset="7521468">They were very attuned as all reapportioning authorities are to the nuisances of the language of this Court’s opinion where they can find a escape hole, where they can interpret an out, they will do so because achieving equality is not a high priority on the part of reapportioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.260" offset="7612374">They have other purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.493" offset="7625331">They do not have purpose unless a Court tells them that they have to have it, but they read Kirkpatrick to say it applies to us and we’re going to listen to it and we’re going to apply it and that’s why we have 53% of the states keeping within a deviation of 5% or less.</text>
