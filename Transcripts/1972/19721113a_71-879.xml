            <text syncTime="40.951" offset="267160">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.380" offset="284923">I would like to introduce co-counsel Croft Jennings from Columbia, South Carolina and my associate counsel Paul Rooney, also from New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.090" offset="331734">This case is here on appeal from the Supreme Court of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.667" offset="353991">The decision in that court unanimously reversed the trial court and upheld the position of the State Tax Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.395" offset="388995">Justice Lewis wrote the opinion in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.298" offset="408534">There are five principal parties involved directly or indirectly in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.926" offset="431104">Heublein Inc. is a Connecticut corporation engaged in the business of manufacturing and distributing alcoholic beverages and other products throughout United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.567" offset="477602">The appellee is the South Carolina Tax Commission, a branch of the South Carolina state.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.608" offset="505814">The Distilled Spirits Institute, a trade association of the producers of alcoholic beverages in United States filed an amicus brief in the preliminary proceedings before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.794" offset="558582">The Multistate Tax Commission and the Solicitor General of the United States have filed amicus briefs in support of South Carolina's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.339" offset="608737">This case involves the application of the interstate income tax law, Public Law 86-272 to the corporate income tax laws of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.196" offset="664116">The text of the Federal statute is set forth on page 30 of the jurisdictional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.046" offset="691597">If I may I would like to read the principal provisions of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.609" offset="717824">Section 381 (a) and I quote with some omissions, "No State shall have power to impose a net income tax on the income derived within such State by any person from interstate commerce if the only business activities within such state by such person or the solicitation of orders by such person, or his representative, in State for sale of tangible personal property, which orders are sent outside the State for approval or rejection, and, if approved, are filled by shipment or delivery from a point outside the State.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="197.779" offset="894516">The statute seems really clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.083" offset="907682">The Heublein's position that its activities in South Carolina were protected by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.294" offset="936521">Thereby rendering Heublein immune from South Carolina income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.942" offset="967137">The lower court proceedings involved two important questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.372" offset="984900">The Court of Common Pleas decided first, that the so called voluntary activities of Heublein in South Carolina which consisted of its usual business solicitation and promotional activities did not violate, did not exceed the minimum activities permitted by the Federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.972" offset="1071208">The lower court also held, this was after trial and testimony, that the activities of Heublein in South Carolina which were mandated by the South Carolina Alcoholic Beverage Control laws did not exceed the minimum permitted by the Federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.024" offset="1147486">The Supreme Court of South Carolina did not disturb the trial court's finding on voluntary activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.645" offset="1181968">It left standing the conclusion that Heublein's voluntary activities in South Carolina did not exceed the minimum permitted by the Federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.623" offset="1221883">However, the Supreme Court of South Carolina held that the activities of Heublein which were mandated by South Carolina's ABC laws, were sufficient to localize its business in South Carolina and thereby render the application of the Federal statute to it no longer effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.541" offset="1309550">Thus the sole issue before this Court is whether Heublein's compliance with the ABC laws of South Carolina is a sufficient basis to deprive Heublein of the protection of the Federal statute.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="319.902" offset="1383006">You say that these Supreme Court of South Carolina left stand the lower court's finding favorable to your client.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.458" offset="1413204">Did the Supreme Court pass on that or treated in anyway or it just ignored it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_m_piga" startTime="331.767" stopTime="351.509">
            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Piga</label>
            <text syncTime="331.767" offset="1430444">There was no discussion of it at all in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.298" offset="1444551">But this was a factual determination I believe on the trial court's record after testimony had been taken so that this factual conclusion of the trial court not being discussed passed upon or changed by the Supreme Court of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.794" offset="1502542">was left standing.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="351.509" offset="1509439">Well, you say that but isn't the ordinary rule that when a judgment comes here from a state court that all presumptions are in favor of the validity of the judgment of the highest court of the state?</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Piga</label>
            <text syncTime="364.987" offset="1563355">I would think sir that the primary purpose of this particular proceeding is to consider the Federal question and the substantial federal question involved in the mandated activities required by the ABC laws of South Carolina and that the factual conclusions of whether Heublein's representative carrying promotional materials from this retail account to another retail account would not be the substantial federal question that should concern this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.394" offset="1692923">Now --</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="397.748" stopTime="402.517">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="397.748" offset="1694386">You don't suppose why then the lower court's findings that were favorable?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_m_piga" startTime="402.517" stopTime="1028.633">
            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Piga</label>
            <text syncTime="402.517" offset="1713403">I think it is important in the overall view of, the overall picture of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.148" offset="1735973">Although we will get into and we will discuss exactly what the local activities of Heublein were that consisted of the so called voluntary activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.967" offset="1779231">That would all be a part of the record of this case and it would be discussed today.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.390" offset="1800965">Now I went to that right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.024" offset="1807444">If I may, Heublein is a Connecticut corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.554" offset="1825625">It produces alcoholic beverages in Hartford and elsewhere and distributes its products throughout the US and in South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.536" offset="1865540">Its best known product is Smirnoff vodka.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.328" offset="1880691">Heublein is not qualified to do business in South Carolina and has no office there.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.729" offset="1902320">It has no warehouse there.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.878" offset="1910888">It has no stock of goods in South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.160" offset="1924054">Its contact with South Carolina is through a local representative, a so called missionary man who calls on retail accounts, liquor stores, clubs, hotels in the promotion of Heublein products.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.357" offset="1988838">Heublein is not permitted to sell directly to retail accounts in South Carolina, by reason of the application of South Carolina ABC laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.627" offset="2029902">Thus Heublein's local representative is not permitted to be a salesman of alcoholic products in South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.784" offset="2066474">However, he did on occasion brief the distributor's salesman, the distributor being the sole outlet of Heublein in South Carolina for the distribution of its goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.871" offset="2122898">All orders for Heublein's products came from a distributor, primarily one distributor.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.372" offset="2148812">These were sent by the distributor to Heublein's office in Hartford for acceptance or rejection there.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.294" offset="2180577">All orders were filled by shipments, by common carrier from goods maintained in inventory outside of the State of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.262" offset="2228433">These are really the limits of the so called voluntary activities of Heublein in South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.237" offset="2264273">We believe that these activities are clearly protected by the federal statute and at the trial court so held after hearing testimony, not only of the local representative but of the South Carolina witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.471" offset="2313279">This holding as I said before has not disturbed by the Supreme Court of South Carolina, but I think it's important to this Court to understand the whole factual picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.711" offset="2362180">Now we come to the activities of Heublein which were mandated by the ABC laws of South Carolina and which it would apply to any non-South Carolinian store whether he had any contact in South Carolina or no contact within South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.225" offset="2432293">These requirements are set forth on Sections 4-131 to 4-150 of the ABC laws of South Carolina which appear in the jurisdictional statement beginning at page 32.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.027" offset="2495509">If I may, it's not necessarily today for the Court to read 8 pages of ABC Laws but I think I can summarize the important points fairly quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.981" offset="2543261">First, the producer must register with the State Tax Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.499" offset="2565413">The producer must also register a local representative, a producer's representative with the State Tax Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.493" offset="2593311">This local representative must be a citizen and resident of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.751" offset="2618389">The producer must also register it's brands with the State Tax Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.008" offset="2643362">All shipments of liquor coming out of state must be consigned in the name of the local producer's representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.682" offset="2686098">A copy of each invoice and bill of lading must be sent to the State Tax Commission at the time of each out of state shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.668" offset="2722043">When the goods arrive in South-Carolina the producer's representative must deliver to the State Tax Commission another copy of the bill of lading and the invoice.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.321" offset="2768645">He obtains then a certificate of transfer from the State Tax Commission and it's only after these steps are taken and completed, may the producer's representative in South Carolina complete the delivery and transfer of the shipping documents and title papers to the wholesaler, to the purchaser in this particular transaction even though in many cases, the liquor itself is already on the premises of the wholesaler distributor.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.909" offset="2887032">These are the mandated activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.884" offset="2898944">According to the Supreme Court of South Carolina these are the activities which resulted in converting inter-state sales into intra-state sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.898" offset="2947009">These are requirements which the highest court of South Carolina, and I quote ‚Äúpreclude the sale of alcoholic beverages in South Carolina through inter-state sales.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="724.969" offset="3003225">These are the mandated activities which prevent the application of the Federal statute to Heublein in the view of the South Carolina tax commission and it's highest court.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.763" offset="3058395">Now we concede here that Heublein complied with the ABC Laws of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.013" offset="3087444">We concede that the ABC Laws of South Carolina required the producer to retain the technical ownership and technical title of it's products until it complies in South Carolina with the ABC Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.418" offset="3157034">We also concede that the technical passage of title to it's products occurs in South Carolina when the shipping papers are endorsed over to the purchaser, the wholesaler distributor in South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.312" offset="3216593">Now again, we should take another look at the Federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.501" offset="3233416">The Federal statute which I quote says, ‚ÄúNo state shall impose a net income-tax on income derived from inter-state commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.192" offset="3268106">If the only business activities of the solicitation orders sent outside the state for approval and if approved are filled by shipment or delivery from a point outside the state.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="805.108" offset="3323800">Under the circumstances in this case, the federal statute expressly applies, if Heublein's income is derived from inter-state commerce and if the shipments or deliveries are made from a point outside the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.424" offset="3385031">It is difficult to conceive of a state of facts which is closer to the protection of the federal statute than this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.042" offset="3423587">Heublein accepts it's goods, accepts these orders in Hartford.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.044" offset="3439574">The inventory of Heublein is maintained outside of South Carolina, generally in Hartford.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.524" offset="3469458">The goods are shipped from Connecticut in most cases directly to South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.211" offset="3492237">They are earmarked for a particular purchase order which has been approved and confirmed by the producer in Hartford.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.298" offset="3532570">These transactions are clearly an inter-state commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.240" offset="3548348">However, the appellate, South Carolina claims the affirmation of it's highest court that the transfer of legal ownership has a technical title in South Carolina as required by it's own ABC Laws, is sufficient to change these inter-state transactions into intra-state transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.674" offset="3638105">The basis for this conclusion is that there is no shipment or delivery from out of state because the goods are still owned by the producer when they arrive in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.490" offset="3697351">It would hardly seem necessary to go beyond plain meaning of the Federal statute to reject this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.895" offset="3722951">However, there is, if there is any ambiguity in the Federal statute, it seems clearly to have been put to rest by the Senate Committee Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.097" offset="3771747">The senate committee report rejected any state imposed point of sale tests in the application of the Federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.990" offset="3811349">If I may again quote, I think it would be helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.119" offset="3827858">This is Senate Committee Report number 658 from the 86th Congress, first session, ‚ÄúThe committee understands that the formulas currently in use are complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.877" offset="3874879">That even within the formulas the meaning of the basic words are inexact and that for example many of the 35 income-tax states used a different definition to cover the term sale.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="955.943" offset="3927124">It understands that a 'sale' maybe a considered to have taken place according to these definitions in any of these locations.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.075" offset="3963695">In the place where the buyer and seller met, in the place where the goods were manufactured, in the place where the goods were stored, in the place where the transaction was finally approved, in the place where the selling company was domiciled or in the place where the goods were shipped, this lack of uniformity creates the possibility that each of a number of different states may regard the same sale as having occurred in it, depending upon the particular definition of sale under it's own tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.179" offset="4100054">Each of several different states treat the same sale as attributable to it because of it's own definition of sale, it is apparent that income from the same sale maybe attributed to each of the states under whose law the same sale is to be attributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.149" offset="4167973">In other words, this is a clear rejection by Congress of any place of sale test, particularly where the place of sale is determined by the particular state or the courts of that state.</text>

            <text syncTime="1549.591" offset="6301759">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.194" offset="6316178">The major issue in this case is whether or not the activities of Heublein in South Carolina exceeded the minimum standards of Public Law 86-272.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.900" offset="6370931">Now counsel for Heublein has raised ‚Äì very ably stated the requirements on the restrictions in Public Law 86-272, therefore, we'll not comment further on that, but I disagree with his argument on the facts because I think that they are contrary to the facts as is set out in the record taken before the Court of Common Pleas in South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.763" offset="6506454">Briefly, if I may comment all of the activities of Heublein in South Carolina are voluntary activities, otherwise they wouldn't be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.459" offset="6545220">So I think that to assume that some of the activities are involuntary and others are voluntary would be a point that bears no -- that does not have any warrant to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.773" offset="6606451">It's just a facetious argument in my opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.351" offset="6628812">There are, however, certain requirements, relating to the shipment and delivery of alcoholic liquors in the South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.656" offset="6662040">And the part of it or the most important provision are the ABC law in regard to this case is found -- is Section 4-134 the code of laws which states that no alcoholic liquor shall be shipped into South Carolina except by a registered producer and a registered producer is defined by statute to be one who is involved in the manufacture of alcoholic liquors or one who had a license to import liquors into the United States from foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.693" offset="6814177">Therefore, I think that the first premise that this case stands on is the fact that importation in interstate commerce is precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.548" offset="6853569">Therefore, we are not concerned with Public Law 86-272, as defined in the introductory paragraph of that Section that net income from business in interstate commerce shall be protected where the minimum activities meet the requirements set out in that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.464" offset="6933191">So the framers of Public Law 86-272, first, supposed that we would be -- that interstate commerce would be protected and not intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.739" offset="6978330">What we have in this case is purely a case of intrastate sales of liquor by Heublein.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.821" offset="7022634">The shipment of alcoholic liquor must be made in accordance with statutes which are set out and which require that prior to a shipment into the state, the registered producer who is registered and licensed to ship into the state must file with the state an invoice and the bill of lading setting out in detail the specific quantities, type, sizes, brands, and so forth liquors which are to be shipped into the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.407" offset="7153037">Now these requirements are all regulatory and so far as controlling the flow of liquor or the moment of liquor across the state boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.379" offset="7188877">And if you read in the particular statute, you will see that that was specifically provided, because the terms from a port without the geographical boundaries to import within the geographical boundaries, shipment shall be controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.142" offset="7243943">The shipment further must be to the producer representative of the registered producer, who shall take the delivery or accept the delivery with in South Carolina and upon acceptance he is required to submit to the state in the -- an invoice for which he endorses the delivery, showing in detail the quantity that types and so forth of liquor which have been received within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.460" offset="7409246">Therefore from the time the delivery, from the time the shipment by the importer commences, it must be controlled and the movement is controlled until it ends in South of Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.315" offset="7468596">Now this is probably an interstate shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.869" offset="7486882">Well, here again this must to come to rest at some point in South Carolina.</text>
