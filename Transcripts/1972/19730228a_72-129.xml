            <label>Mr. A. Raymond Randolph, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="8.751" offset="138428">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.952" offset="147205">As I was discussing yesterday, the only issue in this case is did the District Court earned denying intervention in April 19, 1972 in light of the circumstances existing at that time in light of the allegations before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.948" offset="199137">Under Rule 24 (a), the application for intervention must be timely it is a requirement of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.907" offset="222960">We think this is particularly important on Section 4 (a) cases where time may in fact be of the essence.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.037" offset="247515">Congress itself recognize this by assigning these cases to three Judge District Courts and allowing for direct appeal to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.782" offset="274474">Now here appellants file their motion to intervene on April 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.614" offset="289834">The action itself have been filed by the State of New York in December 3rd. More then four months had passed since the action had originally been filed, the Justice Department had been investigating New York’s complaint during this time and had completed his investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.588" offset="349706">In the District Court, at this time the only explanation, appellants gave to the District Court for filing the action at this time is contained on page 47 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.391" offset="400906">I read from their motion to intervene, paragraph six, “because counsel for petitioners was only informed within the last 48 hours, the United States would not adequately represent the interest of petitioners and because substantial litigation has not yet occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.463" offset="469243">The instant application is to intervene is timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.325" offset="484707">As against this, New York objected to the intervention and their objections are contained on page 67 to 70 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.976" offset="531310">New York pointed out four basic things, number one; the action had been pending for four months.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.990" offset="555342">Number two, appellants or applicants at the time there before the District Court were clearly on notice of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.279" offset="588466">The affidavit pointed to a New York Times article where political leaders in this counties were discussing whether to intervene or whether to take action with respect to New York’s complaint the fact that in the article itself which is reprinted in the reply brief of the appellants here also mentioned that a citizens voter education committee chairman had not mentioned the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.027" offset="679476">The other point that New York made is that intervention at this time would disrupt and possibly preclude New York’s upcoming primary elections where delegates to the democratic national convention would be chosen, where delegates to the state assembly and the state senate and congressional seats would be chosen.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.568" offset="745618">The reasons it would have that effect is because New York had agreed that this is reapportion and is covered by Section 5, unless New York got out from the Act under 4 (a), Section 5 would remain outstanding and then they would have to go through the lengthy process of having clearance with the Attorney General which could not be completed by the time the elections were scheduled to be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.187" offset="836106">The fourth point and form the Department of Justice’s point of view and we think the most important that New York made is that at no time, during this period that the appellants offer any evidence to the Department of Justice regarding why New York was not entitled to summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.465" offset="905279">Now this is what was before the District Court, these are the allegations that were before the District Court and of course the District Court denied intervention at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.940" offset="943104">And we think that the Court acted within its discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.983" offset="955329">The only other case dealing with intervention in the section 4 (a) case which is very close to this case is the Apache County case which we’ve sited and discussed beginning on page 22 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.467" offset="1005275">Judge Leventhal speaking for the Court in that case in discussing intervention said that in these kinds of cases, the applicants must at least first and I quote “bring to the attention of the Department of Justice any instances of discrimination in the use of literacy test.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.995" offset="1083329">The appellants have not done so here and in fact just about a year and half before they sought to intervene they go into record indicating that in fact they had no such evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.804" offset="1126588">I read from the 1969 hearings on the extension of the Voting’s Right Act and Clarence Mitchell’s testimony before the house judiciary committee to chairman of manual seller have used—</text>

            <text syncTime="275.808" offset="1206627">I am trying to indicate why, a possible explanation why no evidence was presented to the Justice Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.392" offset="1232959">This is on record, I am reading from pages 251 to 252, the hearings which is cited throughout appellants brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.093" offset="1263783">Chairman seller have used one of the principle officials of the national association for the advancement of colored people had any appreciable complaints from parts of the country other than those southern states which indicate that there are abuses of the type you have mentioned here.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.013" offset="1315401">Mr. Mitchell, the answer to that question Mr. Chairman is no, it goes on to say, “I would further state that I would check with the general council the NAACP legal defense and education fund Mr. Greenburg, may I ask for his permission to quote him to the said committee?”</text>
            <text syncTime="317.307" offset="1372557">He said “we have not any cases in the long history of our organization involving denial of the right to vote for literacy reasons outside the southern states of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.240" offset="1408293">We have very little litigation on the question of voting in states other than those covered by the 65 Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="331.714" offset="1430235">Well how far outside the record can we go in reviewing the District Court’s decision?</text>

            <label>Mr. A. Raymond Randolph, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="337.618" offset="1453850">I think that you should state exactly within the record Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.254" offset="1476420">I site this because there has been an awful lot of testimony cited on the other side about what other people said during the 1969 hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.314" offset="1500662">I am trying to set kind of the atmosphere that was present at the time when New York instituted this suite, what people concerned with this questions thought about.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.735" offset="1538278">We had allegations in the case that well -- we were interested in this case all along and no one came to us, to ask us in our view of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.089" offset="1567744">In fact, that is not entirely accurate but the point is that for four months nothing was done while the Justice Department was investigating the case and we think that it’s a particular appropriate requirement for intervention in these kinds of cases and the Court in the Apache County.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.538" offset="1633573">So help that the applicants ought to first come to the Justice Department who is investigating the case and present it with the evidence that they have of discriminatory use of literacy test.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.168" offset="1675995">In fact I think if you remember the argument of my colleague here yesterday, that is exactly what they are going to do with respect to the section five actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="474.998" offset="2003362">Well the only way that requirement could be forgotten is if the state got a section 4 (a) judgment removing it from coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.425" offset="2045053">The appellants wanted to intervene to prevent New York from getting the Section 4 (a) judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="868.617" offset="3577814">We don’t think that a person should be allowed that just simply sit back, have the evidence, wait for the government to complete its investigation, wait push it all the way to the moment before primary elections were going to be held and then suddenly say “Hey, we have this evidence and we don’t think New York is entitled to the summary judgment it seeks.”</text>
            <text syncTime="884.957" offset="3643225">We think they ought to have an obligation to come in earlier and present us with it that is what appellants are going to do under their Section 5 submission.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="910.481" offset="3745311">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.645" offset="3757955">I’d like to begin on this climate as question as trying to explain the serious harm that the state of New York would have faced if the delayed intervention of the applicants had been allowed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.451" offset="3813125">To understand this you have to begin with the fact that to no fault of its own, the state of New York was not supplied with a complete set of census statistics by the United States Bureau of the Census until October 15, 1971 and it was only after that date that the state could begin the task of during a 150 new assembly districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.263" offset="3912391">60 new State Senate Districts and then subsequently 39 new Congressional Districts, now it was recognized that a time involved in this and during this districts based on the principle of one man one vote which would characterize county lines could not be completed before the early part of 1972 at the earliest.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.921" offset="3991071">And the state feared that a lengthy process involved in getting this clear through the Justice Department might delay the applicability of these new districts in the 1972 elections and thus the section 4 (a) suit was commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.284" offset="4052511">As it turned out our fears were realized since the assembly in senate districting statute was enacted on January 14, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.918" offset="4095039">It was submitted pursuant to Section 5 on January 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.622" offset="4117817">We did not hear anything further from the Justice Department and so more than seven weeks later when on March 14 we received a letter saying that they wanted further information particularly demographic information as to the population and registration by race and by Puerto Rican ancestry in each of a districts in the three effective counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.007" offset="4203395">I may add that information as to registration is not supplied by the Census Bureau, this requires extra information which would have taken weeks to complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.164" offset="4240071">And therefore when we come to the date of April 7, when appellants are first seeking to intervene, any delay at that point would have caused chaos in the electoral processes in the state of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.435" offset="4293151">On April the 4th, the fist date for circulating petitions for the spring primary had already commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.445" offset="4325125">Without section 4 (a) judgments, all this new lines would have been subject to an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.359" offset="4352815">As a matter of fact, the appellants at the same time if they filed a suite in Washington had filed a suit in the Southern District of New York to halt the elections under the new assembly senate and the congressional district lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.321" offset="4408613">Now what would have happened, we would have to go back to the old districts which were based on population figures on the 1960 census that were 12 years out of date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.716" offset="4458245">Now against the serious harm that the State of New York would have suffered by this delay intervention, what do appellants’ papers show?</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.382" offset="4496906">Do they show thousands of cases in which individuals have been discriminated against in the application of a literacy test?</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.357" offset="4524805">No, they don’t even show a single instance in which any New Yorker has been discriminated in a conduct of a literacy tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.887" offset="4570885">Apparently the thing that appellants are most worried about is their claim that the new congressional lines might have been based on racial gerrymandering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.677" offset="4610069">They site no specific evidence for this but even if this was the case, there is no reason why they could have not bought a Civil Rights Action under section 1983 in the District Courts of New York and trying to prove their case as would have been Dominic as we know from the Gamelan case and Wright v. Rockefeller has been done into many other instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.396" offset="4692929">Instead what they are really trying to do is take the easy way out by a Section 5 action where you don’t have to prove discrimination, all you have to prove is that the state did not comply with the clearance procedures of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.892" offset="4782895">May I remind the Court that in the case of South Carolina versus Katzenbach, at that the time the State of South Carolina was attacking the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in a particular Section 4 and 5 and they made the argument that these sections were unconstitutional because for a state to prove the lack of discrimination would involve an almost impossible burden since it is very difficult to prove a negative of a proposition rather than the positive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.618" offset="4913821">This Court answered that contention while relying primarily on the testimony of the Attorney General Katzenbach and said “all the state need do is submit affidavits from their voting officials attesting to the fact that there has been no discrimination in a conduct of literacy test and man answer any evidence that the Justice Department might uncover during the course of their investigation and that was the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.430" offset="5025102">That is what the State of New York did, they submitted to the District Court every literacy test that was given with in the past ten years and they submitted affidavits from election officials to show that not only did New York City just sit back and waited people to came to it to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.832" offset="5098663">On the contrary, since 1964 the board of elections of the City of New York has sent mobile registration units into the heart of the inner city areas, into the areas where there was a high density of black population and through the use of sound trucks have encourage people to come to register and vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.095" offset="5179747">I dare say, I know of no other city in the country which is that as much that try to encourage minority citizens to vote and therefore we feel that this particular action is particularly unfair that is the consequences of Section 4 based on a purely statistical presumption which we believe we have rebutted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.874" offset="5274833">Now at appellant’s briefs, before this Court although there was no evidence presented by them to the District Court, they have tried to draw an analogy to the Guest and County case, trying to argue that if you can prove educational inequality in New York you can somehow try to raise an argument of discrimination in the conduct of a literacy test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.229" offset="5376293">But in the Gaston case can be easily distinguished from the situation in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.438" offset="5397086">First of all in Gaston, no matter what the educational background of a person was, he had to pass the literacy test even if he has a PHD degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.462" offset="5441181">In the state of New York prior to 1965, if you completed eight grades of school and since 1965 if you only completed six grades of school, you did not have to take a literacy test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.634" offset="5497919">So even if they could show us and we do not believe they could that there was inequality in various schools in the city of New York, this is irrelevant since anyone who has completed six grades of school would not have to take a literacy test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.420" offset="5557060">It is also been shown that throughout the ten year period leading up to the institution of this action, less than 5% of those who took the literacy test failed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.153" offset="5628008">Appellants have also tried to raise an argument that Congress in enacting the 1970 Amendments of the Voting Rights Act sought to include New York State because of some evidence of discrimination and yet nothing in the record of Congress in the hearings of a 1970 extensions points to this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.796" offset="5710555">The purpose of the 1970 Amendment and using 1968 as a standard was simply because it would be illogical to extend the acts protection for an additional five years without updating the date of the election which would serve as the standard in measuring voter participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.079" offset="5779728">Not because of any evidence that could have been any discrimination in New York State and indeed as the Solicitor General has pointed out, Clarence Mitchell when his testimony for the house Judiciary committee admitted that he had no evidence of any discrimination in New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.073" offset="5851617">Now one other argument, I would just like to point to one of the question of the remand, it has been lightly assumed that there would be no dire consequences if this thing was remanded to the District Court to take further testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.956" offset="5899160">May I point out that if the judgment below was vacated, we would now have a cloud of doubt as to the validity of all the existing assembly senate and congressional districts?</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.195" offset="5948165">More than that in this past year, we had a new counsel statute adopted for the city of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.171" offset="5972093">33 new counsel somatic districts which would have not ever been cleared across by the Justice Department and therefore all this new council somatic districts for this year’s election would be subject to an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.001" offset="6019427">In addition, al the election laws that have been passed including the run off provisions for the mayor election of New York city this year would be subject to a Section 5 injunction and therefore we view the consequences of a remand as posing continues chaos in the electoral processes in the State of New York, thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1686.991" offset="6851375">So the timeliness thing live 74 days and there was many accord and still many litigant to get something settled in great deal short of time in 74 days and I submit if the Court have said that here and the parties haven’t complied they could have at that point denied intervention and not allowed the interveners to proceed further.</text>

            <text syncTime="1730.649" offset="7025977">They are asserting the public interest I guess as any litigant does in a constitutional case and even far more than that they’re asserting their own personal interest and it has always been vindicated recognized by the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1776.243" offset="7208312">The counsel or the counsel that the Courts were familiar with and not with anyone who is acting on a frivolous manner and then considerably at the allegations were serious and the serious exhibits were submitted in accord, along with the motion going through judgments so we just have to look at the papers we have before us to come to a conclusion as to what the Court may.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.887" offset="7294934">As to the legislative history which Clarence Mitchell purports to quote me and I did quote me and that has been cited to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.709" offset="7346239">I imagine that that was in a tactical situation of which he was arguing that the law should go forward, the Congress should go forward and pass the law and to cover only the south and not the north.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.802" offset="7382601">Whatever Mr. Mitchell thought and whatever I thought of that moment, Congress thought otherwise and they have passed the law to cover the north as well as the south and indeed the very provision we are talking about is the Cooper Amendment and it just did not adventitiously touched upon New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.850" offset="7430771">On page 19 of our brief Senator Cooper said “the chief state involvement of the state of New York, three candies of New York were involved Bronx, Kings and New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="1853.437" offset="7517080">That is the intent of Congress and we submit that if the intent of Congress is not being carried out by a litigant in a lawsuit be it the United States or anyone else and that lawsuit will affect that party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.807" offset="7562637">Rule 24 quite explicitly provides that there maybe intervention that’s what the appellants attempted to do, that’s what they were not permitted to do.</text>
