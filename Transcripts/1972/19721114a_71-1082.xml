            <label>Mr. Daniel S. Dearing</label>
            <text syncTime="12.111" offset="151803">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.843" offset="162774">This case is here on appeal from the Middle District of Florida wherein a three-judge panel struck the Florida Oil Spill Prevention and Pollution Control Act in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.276" offset="204466">With permission of the Court, the argument will be divided between myself and the Attorney General Robert L. Shevin, State of Florida and I understand that the argument will also be divided to the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.281" offset="252531">Essentially, the operating facts or the operative facts bring in this matter before the Court today of the passage in 1970 by the Florida Legislature of its Oil Spill Prevention and Pollution Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.671" offset="298088">Now this Act, like most legislation was a result of recent history.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.691" offset="318151">The Florida Legislature was not unaware of the serious and deleterious effects of oil spills, massive oil spills in state waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.109" offset="351796">They are aware, all too aware of the results in the Torrey Canyon Disaster and the English Channel in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.610" offset="377814">They are too aware also of spills up country.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.135" offset="391920">For instance when the P.W. Thirtle went down and spilled 31,000 gallons of bunker sea oil into Narragansett Bay off to close to Rhode Island was reported to have ruined the fishing industry in Narragansett Bay as a pertain to oils spillage.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.997" offset="455346">They were aware also that the United States Congress was considering the Federal Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.515" offset="481468">They are aware of the laborious steps taken by the various committees and the passage of this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.368" offset="504874">The Florida Legislature had convened and had been in session for only a few weeks when this matter came before its attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.902" offset="546983">The real impetus to the Florida Act however was the collision in collision in Tampa Bay of the tanker dealing the pump, and the spillage of 21,000 gallons of bunker fuel oil into Tampa bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.796" offset="606542">This brought home adequately and clearly to the legislature the dangers involved and being vulnerable as the State is to the ravages of oil spill pollution of its territory waters and so the legislature met and passed this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.427" offset="673102">The Florida Oil Spill Prevention and Pollution Control Act which provides for absolute and unlimited liability against the owners of vessels, in any event, other major spill and which also provides for certain mechanics for the -- before the fact enforcement of the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.620" offset="753873">Shortly, before the Act was to go into effect that is to say the financial responsibility provisions which are going to the effect the appellees before the Court today, plaintiff below file suit challenging constitutionality of the Act on several grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.689" offset="810088">The lower court, the state defendant on the grounds that the Act was a valid expression of the State’s police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.293" offset="844570">But the lower court decided that instead of being a valid expression of the State’s police power it was in fact an intrusion into an exclusive federal admiralty domain and although the Act was challenged on other grounds, the court below decided issue on that fact alone, in that decision alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.661" offset="921997">Now the Florida, I think it is absolutely necessary to bring the Court -- invite the Court’s attention to two sections of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.602" offset="957733">First of all, Section 2 which sets forth the legislative intent contains this very brief but important paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.561" offset="985631">It says the legislative further declares that it is the intent of this Act to support and complement applicable provisions of the Federal Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970 and in Section 21 of the Act states that this Act being necessary for the general welfare the public health, the public safety of the state and its inhabitants shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes set forth under this Act and the Federal Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.140" offset="1095973">Under the provisions of the Act the State Department of Natural Resources was to issue certain regulations going to the mechanics of enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.375" offset="1132857">These regulations, it is submitted must reflect the intent as set forth in this two phrases, the regulations as well as all other enforcement provisions of this Act, it is submitted, would have to comply and supplement the Federal Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970 and this is particularly important to the position of the State of Florida before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.710" offset="1218226">Now, the court -- the lower court found that the Act violated provisions of uniformity absolutely necessary to the Federal Admiralty Maritime Domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.357" offset="1288756">Now, we submit to the Court that this is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.818" offset="1306624">In the first place, we submit that the concern with prevention and control of oil spill collision of territorial waters is not a maritime matter at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.552" offset="1357615">But if it is, it is certainly a non-exclusive maritime matter where there is concurrent jurisdiction between both the state and the federal governments and we would illustrate that fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="708.099" offset="2935724">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.356" offset="2960802">You Honors, just as maritime law was developed to meet the crisis of developing industry with peculiar problems, so environmental needs of today we believed demand their own jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.147" offset="3019943">The Federal Act, the Water Quality Improvement Act is reflective of this need to develop new concepts of legal responsibilities in crimes against the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.886" offset="3062888">The Federal Act sets the pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.979" offset="3071248">The Florida Act we contend is a legitimate response to the Federal Act to the awakening of a growing necessity by Congress and if conflicts the necessity to deal with massive oil spills which is not here before it had been dealt with and if it conflicts with the tenants of Maritime Law or any other body of law then we contend that the conflict is purely incidental and unfortunate.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.098" offset="3171767">There’s certainly is no a reconcilable conflict between the Federal and Florida Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.192" offset="3192142">The two Acts speak to federals state relationship, cooperation and meeting the threats of massive oil spills.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.342" offset="3220773">The Act speaks of joint cooperation between the state and the federal government to meet serious economic and environmental problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.610" offset="3249821">The national contingency plan that’s outlined in the Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970 speaks to a coordination of effort with matters such as containment, dispersal and removal of oil with state and local agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.082" offset="3307708">In the Federal Act, when it speaks of a marine disaster, it talks of coordinating all public and private interest so the two Acts they interrelate rather than conflict and the implication in both statutes is not competition but cooperation.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.493" offset="3369357">And as Mr. Dearing point out the Florida Act itself says that the intent of this Act to support and complement the applicable provisions of the Federal Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.064" offset="3415646">Now many environmental problems at the state of local level exist, Your Honors in the first instance.</text>

            <text syncTime="874.161" offset="3599966">There is no limitation and to this, Your Honor, we contend that the Federal Government and the anti-preemption clause specifically granted to the State the right to pass any requirement of liability and those are the words any requirement or liability or the terms, the words that are used in the anti-preemption clause so we contend that the Florida Act is simply an extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.861" offset="3694843">With regard to the question of limitation, the Federal Act does allow certain defenses, the Florida Act also allows certain similar defenses of acts of God, and third parties that would be responsible for the negligence and so forth are provided within the Florida Act as well that they can be raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.759" offset="3770389">Your Honors, many of these problems exists in the first instance because of pressures to continue traditional tenants of established jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.367" offset="3804871">Time manner concepts and property law obstruct the State many times in an effort to protect the rights of beaches of inland waterways of natural resources and compound problems with sewage treatment, water purity and other problems severe water pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.981" offset="3867251">So we contend that the Federal Act, the Water Quality Improvement Act is a step forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.049" offset="3887522">It’s a threshold upon which the state local governments can build together with the federal government a new system of laws and environmental jurisprudence to meet the crucial demands brought by the industrial system itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.427" offset="3937050">We contend that this is federalism in the truest sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.399" offset="3952933">If the law were to seek to limit or to extend damages to the federal agency involved which is what the Federal Act speaks to, then and only then where there be a conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.773" offset="3990444">There is no irreconcilable conflict between the two Acts that are being reviewed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.008" offset="4007372">If the Federal Act were to address itself to state recoveries which it does not then such conflict might be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.710" offset="4034226">On the contrary, the Federal Act invites the state to impose any requirement or liability with respect to the discharged of oil into the waters of the State and Florida has done this.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.396" offset="4076962">The danger of a massive oil spill by pollution is both a federal and a state problem that District Court by its decision we contend has frustrated this expression of federalism and if federalism is to be more than an academic theory then it requires an expression in the instant case by reversal of the lower court and a declaration of the Florida law is valid in all respects.</text>

            <text syncTime="1054.425" offset="4321050">Quite obviously, it contains the severability clause, the Solicitor General in his amicus brief which supports the position of the State in many respects disagrees with the position of the State in one or two other respects here just the Court to strike certain portions and allow others to remain and of course the Court has this option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.709" offset="4398164">But its our contention and we take the position in this appeal that the entire Act spell it and that within the traditional police powers of the State, the State has a compelling and urgent and reasonable need to legislate in this field to complement with federal legislation that release is not obtainable in the admiralty courts when the limitation of liability is based upon the value of the vessel after the fact because if the vessel sinks we’re talking about the limitation being based upon the salvage value of the vessel that this will not give us the type of remedy that’s necessary to cleanup massive oil spills and to give a relief to third party as to citizens of Florida who have a justifiable cause and cannot obtained any justice in the courts if they are limited to going in through an admiralty proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1276.047" offset="5207542">Well, Your Honor assuming the constitutionality of the Admiralty Extension Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.498" offset="5221334">It creates a very serious problem except for the fact that the Congress and the Water Quality Improvement Act, we think founded that on the Commerce Clause specifically recognizes other responsibilities, other concepts of liability rather than the old 1851 Standards and specifically, Your Honor if the Federal Water Quality Improvement Act was considered by the Congress to be in the admiralty area dealing with oil spills then why would they have provided the Act that the remedies are in the Federal District Court?</text>

            <text syncTime="1331.093" offset="5427702">Yes we’re arguing that the Congress recognized an emerging new concept that jurisprudence that they legislated accordingly, that they clearly gave the states the responsibility and invited the States to pass similar legislation and to go further and this is what the State of Florida has done and if the Water Quality Improvement Act is to have any meaning in the field of jurisprudence to be able to react to and prevent a massive oil spill, then the State ought to be able to legislate in this field as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.581" offset="5545671">Now, You Honors, the Federal Act does nothing more than set minimum standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.521" offset="5573465">I gives the states the rights to adopt more stringent requirements, this is what the State has done just like in the Clean Air Act, just like in the Water Pollution Act in and of the Air and Water Pollution Acts the State had been given the right to move further just like the present cooperation between the Federal Government and Florida to save Florida’s coastal lands and tidal waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.185" offset="5652146">The Florida Act is no more violative of the Water Quality Improvement Act than our Water Quality Standards develop by the States violative of another Section of the law 33 U.S.C. 1171 subsection (b) of which requires a party seeking a federal discharge permit to obtain certification from the State Water Pollution Agency that the anticipated discharged will not violate state water quality standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.495" offset="5741380">And if the non-preemption clause of the Water Quality Improvement Act is to have any meaning as a Congress intended, surely it should permit the State as Florida has done to allow private claimants in the state itself to recover under strict liability principles rather than the Fault Concept of Maritime Law and they speak of uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.679" offset="5814105">Certainly, uniformity would be something that the maritime attorneys would desire and perhaps the insurers would desire uniformity but the Solicitor General in his brief agrees and concedes that although the application of Florida standard of liability absolute might create a lack of uniformity that this is not a subject requiring uniform federal regulation, that there has been no preemption and even if negligence is considered to be the standard, there is no policy of Maritime Law opposed to liability without call for damages caused by oil spill from ships that Florida has a legitimate right and interest to legislate and to apply the standards of liability and view of the potential impact of oil spills on Florida’s environment and economy and that the Solicitor General in other words contends that this is an area of concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.844" offset="6022771">Now, the lower court apparently felt that each course was dictated by a series of earlier cases Jensen, Knickerbocker, Dawson and these cases have been mentioned by Mr. Dearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1628.315" offset="6616586">It should be left to the crazy-quilt regulation of the different states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.011" offset="6639365">In this connection, we respectfully call the Court’s attention to Table B annexed to the brief of appellees American Institute of Merchant Shipping and others which contains a sampling of the various state laws in this new field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.509" offset="6733406">This shows that the clients, if Your Honors please that there is a great deal of difference among the various States in their handling of the pollution problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1681.626" offset="6829850">The 1899 Refuse Act makes no mention of oil allow although, I’m sure you are aware sir the courts have been applying the 1899 Act to include discharges of oil and have been finding ship owners for causing discharges of oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.177" offset="6916054">But the first time oil was at the mentioned as such in a federal statute was in 1924 Oil Pollution Act which was amended in 1966 and was repealed by the Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970.</text>

            <text syncTime="1731.985" offset="7031306">I don’t believe the size of the tankers has had much to do with it because there had been very few incidents of spills of large quantities of oil from large tankers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.569" offset="7089612">The Torrey Canyon of course is the most notable but there is no doubt that the increased need for oil in the more developed countries and also now in the developing countries has greatly increased the need for ocean tonnage in the tanker area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.942" offset="7175189">And many, many times more oil is being carried today by sea than it was carried just a few years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.314" offset="7204655">Another development, Your Honor is the tendency to refine or at destination rather than at the source.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.839" offset="7242689">Now this increases the potential for pollution damage but on the other hand it minimizes the number, the tragedies that resulted from explosions and fires on the vessels carrying gasoline and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.387" offset="7332968">The admiralty clause if the Court pleases is not merely a constitutional grant of judicial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.905" offset="7371003">It’s perfectly true that its couched in terms of judicial power but when read conjunction with necessary and proper clause, this Court has repeatedly held that it grants to Congress the paramount power to legislate in the maritime field and where Congress has not acted then it is for this Court and the lower federal courts to define the General Maritime Law which is to prevail throughout the whole country and not just in one area.</text>

            <text syncTime="2495.268" offset="10084394">I respect very highly Attorney General but I find that some of his statements here to be frankly incredible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.299" offset="10144580">When he makes a flat statement that there is no conflict between the State Act and the federal laws, I think his badly wrong as I’d like to try to demonstrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.225" offset="10196302">In fact, the District Court after considering this case found that there were so much in conflict and so much wrong about the State Act that if it were stripped of all of its conflicts there would be no viable act left and that is the reason why we have not considered that there was any question of severability the remaining of course I don’t deny that this Court would have every opportunity he did ask to deal with the case in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.662" offset="10325974">But the pilot himself in his brief acknowledges that there is no basis of severability here and we strongly make that contention too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.258" offset="10368397">There was no question raised in the jurisdictional statement regarding severability and so we do not believed that question is properly before this Court on the initiative of the parties involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.211" offset="10452198">The thing I would like first of all to emphasize is the fact that, what Florida really seeks to do here is to establish in the words of the Solicitor General, I comprehensive regulatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.710" offset="10514160">It’s not just an Act dealing with these couple of matters of liability without thought and limitation of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.915" offset="10539029">The State of Florida puts itself in the business of regulating, what is obviously, admiralty jurisdiction and it regulates it in a very comprehensive way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.072" offset="10595662">This involves to control and regulation of ships as State Act does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.058" offset="10615620">It involves terminals that exist for the purpose of servicing to those ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.366" offset="10636831">It involves navigation in the navigable water of the United States very importantly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.641" offset="10661909">This total scheme is what the District Court invalidated and what we feel this Court should do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.430" offset="10701093">Let me refer to just a few of the provisions of this law that haven’t been mentioned here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.139" offset="10723976">The law provides of course for licensing of these terminals in the issuance of certificates of registration for them annually provided, the terminals demonstrate that they have certain equipment on hand and that they are disposed to cooperate completely with the State and in any program of prevention and correction of oil spills.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.193" offset="10804120">And it follows this language, the Department that’s the State Department shall adopt regulations to govern operating and inspection requirements for facilities, vessels, personnel and other matters related to licensee operations under this Act and specifically requiring that vessels, transporting pollutants within state waters shall maintain on board such containment gear as may be required by the Department that it is to state with a crew trained in the use of such gear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.442" offset="10929089">Now this is what the state is seeking to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.858" offset="10942777">The States further makes provisions under this law for the designation of support managers and take a look at some of the duties and obligations and rights of these port managers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.840" offset="10990738">They are to organize recover teams, that’s understandable although the federal law provides for what they call strike forces which is the same function really.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.681" offset="11038072">These port managers are authorize to board vessels that out there they are going to come into the port to inspect these vessels for the seaworthiness and of course that can include a great many things and to decide whether in their opinion the port manager, the State manages a few it is seaworthy and decide whether it has a proper gear on it and decide whether its crews have been trained suitably to allow to them to enter one of Florida’s level deep-water ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.385" offset="11172864">The port manager also has the right after he stops the ships out there to tell them that he must anchor, he can’t come in now because of whether conditions and if he does come in, he can tell him where to go and where to stop and other things at a purely operation and navigation limit completely covered by coast guard services and other federal services at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.214" offset="11276204">The law also provide for the preparation of a contingency claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.877" offset="11294908">Invite -- involving all the agencies of the State Government to help it enforce all of these provisions and to help provide remedies for spill if it occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.412" offset="11337017">This of course is patterned directly after the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.365" offset="11348825">The 1970 Water Quality Improvement Act was passed to defense of this Act and obviously, the Federal Act was before the draft of this Act and was used as a model somewhat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.593" offset="11393755">What the State was just trying to do is do all the federal governments going to do and do much more in conflict with some of the things the Federal Government provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.523" offset="11437432">Now, in doing all these things as port managers authorized to do, he runs squarely into the coast guard and its responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.254" offset="11472436">This is a comprehensive federal contingency plan and there is a federal contingency plan responsibility for recovery spills and strike forces and all of these things are all provided under that Federal law and the coast guard, the federal authorities of course have authority to prevent ships from coming in and giving them directions at which the state is putting itself in business of doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.802" offset="11578598">Here you have very specific conflicts but these conflicts are just the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.142" offset="11603989">This navigational management of conflicts because both state and the federal require showing the financial responsibility, the state makes no provision for accepting and showing that the Federal Government requires a financial responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.727" offset="11662294">This imposes its own making it a little tougher and there is a provision that and I don’t know just how this should be interpreted but in all these where the cost guard and the state teams move together while it’s a provision that the State shall act independently of the federal authorities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2909.712" offset="11742229">Well Governor, is it your position that the regulation of the State under the State Act is so pervasive that none of it can survive?</text>

            <text syncTime="2919.707" offset="11782248">Yes sir, that’s absolutely sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.498" offset="11797400">And of course we go and that there are all these conflicts regarding the extent of liability limitation and non-limitation of liability, the State deprives people of rights and defenses in very harsh terms that are in conflict with the federal terms, and all of these other things that are mentioned herewith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.352" offset="11880782">Now, and the State frankly insist that its law supersede those of the Federal Government in these respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.301" offset="11928534">And we say that it is a Congress’ responsibility to regulate in this field and it must be the Congress’ responsibility to regulate in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.122" offset="11963852">We are proud about beaches and of course we want to protect them why therefore denying other States of the union who are equally proud of those that they have or may have and this is a matter that requiring uniformity of action and that action can only come through federal leadership and federal direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.373" offset="12044831">A room for the States to cooperate but this is not any way for the State to seek to cooperate with the Federal Government in its comprehensive plan to deal with this very difficult problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.907" offset="12091016">Now, I think the best of all the cases and very essentially that dealing with this matter of federal state relations and responsibilities in the admiralty field is Kelly against Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.845" offset="12138768">And there you have read pervasive state statute that sought to provide inspection of boats and ships that were not provided to be inspected by the Federal Government and do all kinds of boats, some of them foreign commerce, some in the interstate commerce, some in intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.472" offset="12213269">And the State Supreme Court there held that that Act was an improper innovation of the Federal Admiralty Domain though it did apply only to ships not subject to federal inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.974" offset="12259244">And the case came up here and Justice Hughes wrote the opinion for the Court and he sets out very clearly the three governing rules that apply and I think applied right here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.309" offset="12308564">First, he says is there a conflict with federal law?</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.929" offset="12323088">He says if there’s a conflict with federal law, the federal law prevailed because it is paramount and the state law fails.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.291" offset="12352554">Secondly he says, if the subject is one demanding uniformity whether a conflict or not that the state action will not be permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.157" offset="12392051">Well, we submit here we have a proposition that does require uniformity of dealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.705" offset="12414203">Then he said that there was room for a state to deal with purely local exigencies when there was neither conflict nor a necessity for uniformity and some very limited action was allowed the State to act in this area pending action by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.678" offset="12482121">Now, those are the -- that’s a modern rule for protecting the maritime, a jurisdiction and administration of this nation and it does belong to this country and if doesn’t belong to the several states because that has a countrywide responsibility and a nationwide responsibility and I submit that on all three of those considerations that this Act fails.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.846" offset="12578774">They argued that hereon which cited the Kelly against Washington Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.854" offset="12606777">The case of Michigan over there was a municipal coordinate dealing with smoke intensity and the Court allowed that to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.585" offset="12637706">They claimed that that where there’s a -- was a departure from Kelly against Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.317" offset="12664665">It was really an effort by the Court to adjust to that little local room there, a local exigency, the particular situation which provided the misdemeanor for a ship to be emitting smoke in the City limits of Detroit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3169.294" offset="12780544">Yes, it was claimed that federal inspections were required of this and this particular type of (Inaudible) met with federal inspections and there was a strong dissent in that case that my personal feeling would follow actually, that was by Justice Frankfurter and Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.209" offset="12856195">But even so that’s just a tiny, tiny island there that that cannot be possibly be a base of foreign act that this is as far reaching this as this went years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.668" offset="12925994">So we say it is up to the Congress to say what the (Inaudible) is and I would like to call the Court’s attention to the fact that the Congress had not been lax in its interest in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.249" offset="12964342">It is move very importantly over the last 25 years that to meet needs that arising in this matter of greater and greater demand for more and more shipping of oil to meet the greater and greater demand for electric power this country and that same thing is true all over the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.311" offset="13040619">This is a serious problem but it’s not one that the Congress is not aware of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.447" offset="13057128">It’s not one that the Congress didn’t moving very specifically and very importantly to meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.502" offset="13117419">In our case, there is conflict, the United States is exercising its paramount power and the State is seeking in to supersede this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.892" offset="13154931">In our case, there is a necessity for uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.076" offset="13171649">They argue about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.330" offset="13176665">They can’t possibly say that this matter of controlling this kind of navigational operation and experienced is a local matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.126" offset="13207907">But we could have an oil spill at Pensacola that might not hurt Pensacola totally and might wind up in Mobile and it creates a problem in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.298" offset="13240613">Now supposed to use a hypothetical case we had a spill up near New York and it got to go stream and started drifting up the New England Coast there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.264" offset="13284394">Well, if they applied the law that the Attorney General is seeking to uphold here then you will have a New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.867" offset="13318875">A team out there trying to deal with this matter and telling the master of the ship what to do with the ship and how to handle it and trying to manage a team and then when did this spill across the Stateline and you got into Connecticut while here’s another state out there with another team and whole regulations and more controlled and different ones and so it goes the main you’ve have the same sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.691" offset="13414170">This is definitely an area which we require uniformity and requires the kind of action that the Federal Government is applied at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.233" offset="13460355">In the national conventions of a dealing with this subject and importantly and of course this would supersede any state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.754" offset="13510405">The ship as I represent do not seek to avoid regulation concerning oil spills.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.100" offset="13535796">On the contrary, they had worked with Congress and continued to do so in relation to oils spill legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.761" offset="13562441">However, this ship was worked daily in the complexities of the federal admiralty scheme and they realized as a practical matter and impossible situation would exist if States were free to legislate within the area of oil spill control as Florida seeks to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.938" offset="13623150">There is a better way now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.779" offset="13630464">There is a better way then for each state to try to outdo the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.857" offset="13646764">We’re all in this together, the State Act should be found invalid here at the District Court has.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.655" offset="13669961">And the interested state should then find ways to exhibit their effectiveness in the formulation support and execution of federal policy in this field and there is no lack of federal power, there is no disposition by our federal leadership not to move, there’s no lack of awareness of the States involved for Florida and all the sister states as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.718" offset="13754284">So we submit the case, the decision should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.170" offset="13768077">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3426.204" offset="13808201">Governor Collins if that spill that you referred to ends up in Mobile then I would hope that the State of Alabama has a law similar to Florida’s because then they could take care of that spill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.539" offset="13845504">If it ends up in Pensacola then I want to be certain that the State of Florida can cleanup that spill and at the people who are damaged by that spill have a right of recovery in a court of law and are not limited by high bound traditions which do not speak to the question of massive oil spills.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.092" offset="13915721">By the use of the words, any requirement or liability in the Water Quality Improvement Act, it is clear that the Congress fully intended to give broad latitude to the States to enact whatever requirements of liabilities and standards of the states deemed warranted in the exercise of their legislative powers to prevent and control and provide relief from oil pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.043" offset="13999522">Congress was not only acquiescing in the enactment of state legislature they were actually inviting the States to act to pass its legislation and pursuant to this invitation Florida passed its law and this law was based on direct and compelling interest that the State has urgent interest for the protection of its economy and its environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.517" offset="14081442">It’s the proper exercise of the police power the State to protect our citizens and a such should be given the full weight despite the lack of uniformity which the Act -- which might result because of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.472" offset="14133269">Now, if it please the Court, the Federal Admiralty Extension Act we contend was improperly extended by the Congress beyond the constitutional jurisdiction of the admiralty court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.335" offset="14176737">However, even if the extension Act were to apply and is upheld by this Court and even if the Water Quality Improvement Act was bottomed on admiralty rather than commerce there’s still would be room for state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.212" offset="14240266">This is not in exclusive domain, there is still room for state action, there’s still concurrent authority and the Solicitor General in his amicus briefs says uniformity and we agree must yield to the overriding need for the State to legislate for the interests of its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.570" offset="14301602">Florida has legislative within the traditional bounds of the State’s police power and to protect our citizens and to protect our environment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3626.547" offset="14609533">Well, let me speak to that because I think that would be the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.407" offset="14624998">There had been no Florida regulations promulgated as to what type of containment gear this vessel must have to be able to prevent the spill and take it up as soon as it occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.631" offset="14665853">The coast guard has not yet promulgated regulations and to rule our Act or that Section invalid this Court must presume that Florida’s regulations will conflict with the federal coast guard regulations and we don’t think that this Court should presume that or speculate with regard to what the regulations will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.293" offset="14736593">We think it’s entirely consistent with the Florida Act which says this Act was designed to complement the Federal Water Quality Improvement Act that certainly as to questions of containment gear and this type of regulations that those regulations would be promulgated to be consistent with the regulations of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.814" offset="14810676">If I may just end, Your Honor, I think my time is just about out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.062" offset="14823633">We asked them -- we challenged them to show us how Florida and its citizens would be able to receive damages for cleanup.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.337" offset="14848711">And they said, well the Federal Government is coming and cleanup the beach but we don’t want to have to rely upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.064" offset="14867623">We are not certain that’s going to occur, that’s not part of this record if the Torrey Canyon went down 16 miles off from Florida rather than 16 miles off of London there wouldn’t have been no recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.369" offset="14908897">We have been limited to $50.00 salvage value and that’s why the Water Quality Improvement Act gives broad powers and directs the State to Act and why is they’re presently pending before the Senate of the United States a treaty which would be near to unlimited liability, $15 million and a contingency fund and absolute or strict liability, why is that treaty pending if existing federal law is enough to provide cleanup cost and damages?</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.892" offset="15026970">Obviously, existing federal law is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.393" offset="15036897">The Water Quality Improvement Act seeks to speak in this field, directs the State Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.879" offset="15054869">The State has acted constitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.973" offset="15063228">We ask you to uphold this law.</text>
