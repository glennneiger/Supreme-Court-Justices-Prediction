            <text syncTime="158.748" offset="738408">That was in fact demandable for rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.593" offset="749693">If someone is in the county jail and he is arrested is presumed innocent, there seems to be no — certainly there is no need for the state or the county, or any political entity to institute a rehabilitation program for someone who is presumed innocent and is presumed to have no need for rehabilitation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.102" offset="827747">It is only after he has been convicted that not only does the state presume the need but the individual inmate.</text>

            <text syncTime="548.702" offset="2298232">Good time on the minimum doesn’t serve that function, it's more of a rehabilitator function.</text>

            <text syncTime="571.673" offset="2390079">Now I as pointed out in my brief historically, there has always been a distinction between what was called commutation between conduct and compensation which was for positive performance and the whole history of the New York correctional scheme tries to strike a balance between the two until finally in 1931 the two were consolidated and in fact at one point they used to actually pay people for compensation, and they finally reduced sentence for compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.523" offset="2497494">Now, specifically in the statute, there is a reduction in sentence for both good conduct and for the efficient and willing performance of duties assigned.</text>

            <text syncTime="824.522" offset="3401435">They have to evaluate the man and it's perfectly reasonable for the state to set up a system that says, we are not going to consider time spent in institution where we had no chance of evaluating him.</text>

            <text syncTime="866.773" offset="3570500">That might be true but the constitution doesn’t require that the state do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.484" offset="3593279">There is nothing unreasonable about the statutory scheme which is set up right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.114" offset="3615848">State prisons and county jails are completely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.906" offset="3634970">County jails for the first part offer nothing, they are purely detention centers.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.317" offset="3656600">There is certainly not a fact in this record to show that they offer anything, and it would be impossible for the state to set up a system of evaluation or a rehabilitative program in an institution where people are presumed innocent and could not be subject to but in fact if they were compelled to participate we have a Thirteenth Amendment problem and also we have to sense this the amount of time spent in the county jail is so short comparatively that if you are going to set up any sort of a meaningful program or even have any meaningful evaluation, it would not be worthwhile to look upon two or three months in an institution where nothing can really be accomplished within that space.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.117" offset="3847816">Now unless you remember that the evaluation by the Correction Department, it is dual evaluation here, first the Correction Department certifies to the parole board that this man is now ready to be considered for release and this is certainly something the legislature can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.997" offset="3919391">The opinion of the court below are argued strongly that the Parole Board has a lot of discretion, so it doesn’t really matter, but a state legislature certainly has the power and the right to draw line and set up to a certain point, parole board, you are not allowed to make this evaluation because we have made a legislative determination that a man has to spend a particular amount of time in a particular program.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.699" offset="4018134">And this evaluation and I left out Section 214(4), the Correction Law, is a very serious one because it involves a complete re-determination of the inmate's attitude, of his progress and this is made by officials, the Director of prison industries, the physician, the warden, the Director of education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.943" offset="4115101">This is serious evaluation and it cannot be done by considering time in a county jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.504" offset="4149373">Now what essentially happened here was that the District Court ignored everything, ignored -- in fact the District Court acknowledged that there are certainly differences and yes there were different goals and yes, you really can’t rehabilitate people in county jails, but it ruled out the primary basis for this statute was whether someone was good or bad, and that is it and this totally ignored the differences that I have stated that the primary basis for the release on good time on the minimum sentence is the rehabilitative function, not a custodial function.</text>

            <text syncTime="2049.333" offset="8300753">They stated first that the Equal Protection clause requires only that the state practice be rationally based and free from invidious discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.710" offset="8346206">They also stated that while certain individuals might be substantially harmed by any form or type of discrimination that this would be okay if there is a valid governmental objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.690" offset="8398137">However, I believe that the important aspect of this is a Court’s comment immediately after this and this is found on Page 59 (a) of the Appendix, the Court after citing these two principles and after I believe showing clearly to this Court that the lower court was aware of their duty, the Court stated that they would countenance any artificial distinctions, not reasonably related to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.824" offset="8502627">And I think this is the grass root problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.655" offset="8514017">The Court has determined that the justifications presented by the Attorney General in this case are not reasonably related to the statute and are purely artificial distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.275" offset="8560515">And the Attorney General Your Honor has stated that the District Court has totally misapplied the Equal Protection standards and the reason they misapplied it, number one is that they did not challenge the Attorney General’s argument that there is a difference between the facility's purpose and usage of the state jails versus the local penal institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.744" offset="8690395">Now, we also note that the state has considered these differences as I stated before and they found out that they were not reasonably related to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.891" offset="8742954">The manner in which they found – they arrived at this conclusion is by looking at the legislative intention and the manner in which they did this was, was civil and the first case the fact that good time is a disciplinary device in the state penal institution was readily conceded by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.325" offset="8852668">Also, we find that in the New York State Court this is in the case of Perez versus Follette which is cited on Page 8 of our brief and in Page 60 (a) of the Appendix, this Court while upholding the constitutionality of the statute arrived at the same conclusion that good time is an effective disciplinary device.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.371" offset="8936887">Also we find that while this case refers solely to the provisions of Section 230(3) which states -- or excuse me -- which draws the distinction between the county inmates who are subsequently send to the state and persons who are not so detained prior to being sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.371" offset="9028838">The Courts in New York have also considered the following subsection, this is 330(4) and this concerns the maximum release date.</text>

            <text syncTime="2317.919" offset="9375013">No, that this -- it’s very difficult to say whether this was the only intent because the case doesn't – it's trying to find that factor really.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.525" offset="9409494">However, there are other considerations that the Court should look at when they look at the legislative stand not only one case that was decided by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.867" offset="9458813">As I was explaining before the difference between Subdivision 3 and Subdivision 4 of the Section 230 of the New York Correction Law, draws clear distinction between in one case the pretrial detention of prisoners as far as good time under minimum sentence is concerned and pretrial detention of prisoners as far as their maximum or conditional release date from a state penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.103" offset="9575737">The first subdivision, Subdivision 3 specifically states that this good time should be determined on the amount of the minimum sentence less jail time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.837" offset="9630699">Subdivision 4 however, does not refer to jail time whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.270" offset="9648462">In People versus Deegan and the case of Paul versus Warden who served at county jail which is found in the Appendix at Page 68 and also Page 8 of our brief, this very issue of whether jail time should be included or excluded in the computation of good time to be provided in the determination of the maximum sentence was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.017" offset="9751489">And what was the argument by the state in both of those cases?</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.030" offset="9767476">In both of those cases the state argued that there are differences between the county jail and differences between the state jails.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.325" offset="9800704">There are differences in purpose, usage and facility and both in of those cases the courts rejected the state argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.553" offset="9833618">And I believe that's very important to show the legislative purpose their.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.315" offset="9848665">Another example, when a prisoner arrives at a state penal institution after being transferred from the county jail, when is his good time computed?</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.975" offset="9895267">It's computed immediately upon his arrival.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.209" offset="9908224">And I believe the statement of the District Court is very correct, when it states that this indicates that a prisoner does not earn good time credit, when he is in state penitentiary, instead he is penalized for bad behavior and how is he penalized?</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.145" offset="9979904">I believe the state legislature made this quite clear in establishing various boards for discipline the person and also for determining when good time should be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.579" offset="10029641">There are two boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.727" offset="10034239">We have -- I am referring to one, this is the, what they call the superintendent proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.015" offset="10079483">This superintendent proceeding is a proceeding that is used whenever there is disciplinary action taken against the prisoner in a state prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.370" offset="10116890">This action arises whenever there is misbehavior involving a danger to life, health, security or property or in a case where there are persistent minor violations against the rules of the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.067" offset="10179688">This is a very elaborate procedure which starts where a report is filed by one of the sheriffs or one of the guards on the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.411" offset="10216991">This report is subsequently forwarded to what they call the adjustment committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.352" offset="10232769">The adjustment committee reviews the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.221" offset="10244263">The adjustment committee may take three actions, it may recommend reappraisal of the prisoner's program, it may recommend nullification of the report or it may take what they call adjustment committee action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.874" offset="10294836">Adjustment committee action very briefly is an action where they discuss the problem where the person who are involved, the inmates and the guards on the floor etcetera, and after this adjustment committee rules on this case, it may take further action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.358" offset="10364844">It may confine a person in his cell or it may confine the inmate in a private housing unit or it may take away specific privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.926" offset="10403088">Up to this time we must realize that there is absolutely no provision for taking away good time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.138" offset="10427956">Good time is taken away subsequently, they have to go through further proceedings to get to the point where they can actually take away good time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.153" offset="10464005">After the adjustment committee has made their ruling, only until there are persistent violations after that could they possibly refer this to a superintendent proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.304" offset="10520639">At a superintendent's proceeding if one has had—we have a formal procedure of due process where a person is represented by employee of the state prisons they charge—</text>

            <text syncTime="2766.727" offset="11170252">There is a very good possibility that it would apply equally to that jurisdiction also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.259" offset="11192404">I believe also that while we have – returning to the superintendent's proceeding, here we have one example of administrative action or procedure which is definitely punitive in nature and it’s a definitely a disciplinary board in nature which takes away good time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.964" offset="11271189">In response to this the Attorney General stated that there is another board, this is a time allowance committee and he says that the time allowance committee considers more than just the behavior of the inmate while in prison in determining whether good time should be allowed or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.310" offset="11336600">And I would like to state -- specifically I would like to quote from a statute which determines or which directs exactly what the purpose of this committee is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.583" offset="11385710">This is found on Page 68 of the Appendix and also recognizing the appellants brief on Page 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.673" offset="11410056">They state that in regards to this board whether they should allow good time or not, they said the board shall have discretion of withholding the good time allowance as and I quote “a punishment for offenses against the discipline of the prison or penitentiary in accordance with the rules herein before mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.327" offset="11484662">Reduction credited to a prisoner in the first instance, in his account, by the warden, as provided in section 230 shall stand as the reduction allowed, unless withheld wholly or partly by the board as punishment, as above provided."</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.791" offset="11542549">I believe this purely shows and clearly shows the legislative intention that the reduction of good time is a punishment for bad behavior in a prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.294" offset="11592600">And then also there are very many situations where good time is credited to other persons in different situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.031" offset="11639515">Such as good time is credited to both misdemeanants and felons serving definite sentences in county jails and this is very important because the language referring to these individuals which is Section 250 of the Correction Law states that good performance or a good time shall be credited based upon the defendant's behavior, conduct and his efficient and willing performance of duty in that county penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.932" offset="11767097">It is exactly the same language as contained in Section 230(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.738" offset="11794369">And I believe that this would undermine the Attorney General's argument that any difference in usage, purpose or availability of facilities, in the county jail versus the state penal institutions is a determinative factor in deciding good time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.766" offset="11870438">And in this regard I would like to used another example while we are contesting mainly or while we are considering mainly the local county jail as the pretrial detention facilities, there are other pretrial detention facilities in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.943" offset="11931146">They don’t have the -- I believe Mr. Chief Justice you asked before whether they had a pretrial facility which really was not detention, which was a minimum security facility, they do not have any such thing in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.905" offset="11986944">However, they do have two other facilities for pretrial detentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.610" offset="12001782">If a person is found to be criminally insane and not competent to assist his attorney in presenting the defense in his case then he maybe certified to the various state institutions in the state of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.978" offset="12055280">These are state institutions for the mentally retarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.394" offset="12068968">They have two such state institutes, one under the jurisdiction of the Commissioners of Mental Hygiene, the second one is under the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Correction the person involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.134" offset="12119960">The Commissioner of Correction has jurisdiction over two such facilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="3114.777" offset="12562474">It's not a reasonable thing to do, you would hardly take a person who is confined because he is mentally incompetent and hold him to the standards that you would hold normal people.</text>

            <text syncTime="3123.996" offset="12599359">Yes, Your Honor but this would be -- they are not really applying the standards because he is being confined due to their mental problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.057" offset="12627571">They are computing this because he’s been transferred from a state prison where he’s already been subjected to an indeterminate sentence and then sending him to the mental hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.561" offset="12665605">So he is still under the custody of the Commissioner of Correction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.113" offset="12679816">Now, while the Commissioner of Correction does give the good time credit for a person who has been transferred from the state prison, we submit that there are different usages, purposes and availability facilities in the mental hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.679" offset="12746062">And we believe it's obvious that there is a difference between the mental hospitals and the state jails.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.381" offset="12764871">To counter this argument the Attorney General stated in Page 7 of his reply brief that it is difficult to see how this diminishes the validity of Section 230(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.650" offset="12810010">These are two classes of inmates who have been transferred to state institutions that have programs specifically designed for their specialized needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.327" offset="12844701">Willing participation and performance in these treatment programs under state's supervision which certainly call for the awarding of good time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.586" offset="12877720">Now, I submit to this Court readily that this is quite a cogent argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.621" offset="12893811">However, I would pose a question to the Attorney General if these programs or if these facilities do have programs that are beneficial to the inmates and if they do believe that these programs meet the specialized needs of the inmates then why does not the Commissioner of Correction give good time credit for the amount of time that a person spends in these exact facilities if its pretrial confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.716" offset="12998196">They do not give good time on this period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.799" offset="13014601">So I believe that the different types of programs is not related to the giving of good time and I think this is specific example which points that out clearly.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey Sorge</label>
            <text syncTime="3246.432" offset="13089102">I believe it would be somewhat of a basis, because I believe in the first place it shows a practice in New York state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.764" offset="13114389">In the second place I would argue that it is at least an indication of the state's intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.921" offset="13139048">I believe also that we find that there is supposedly a uniform scheme of granting, the computation of a person's sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.969" offset="13175202">I believe that this would also have an effect on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.023" offset="13191502">I believe that this presents a definite conflict in the states practice. Secondly we have other examples which present similar examples of conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.436" offset="13229119">For example, if the person is already been sentenced and has been received in a state prison, if he is subsequently transferred back to a county jail for a post-conviction remedy and remains in the county jail until that post-conviction remedy is completed, then transferred back to the state prison, he gets good time credit for the amount of time that he spent in the county jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.636" offset="13313964">So here he is being detained in exactly the same facility as are the persons that are discriminated against under Section 230(3), however as a matter of policy of New York state, he is getting good time credit for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.059" offset="13367568">I submit to this Court that this is an incredible inconsistency and I believe that the explanation just submitted to Mr. Chief Justice would apply equally here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.544" offset="13405497">Here is an indication of the intent of the legislature etcetera. Lastly as the Attorney General has argued that the District Court misapplied the standards of the equal protection in that it did not consider their argument that good time should not be reduced from the pretrial detention period because in effect it reduces the amount of time that a parole board has to consider whether a person should be eligible or not for parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.677" offset="13554082">I submit that the District Court did in fact consider this proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.429" offset="13577070">On page 63 (a) of the Appendix, the District Court came out in extremely strong language as a matter of fact, it stated that the fears of the District Attorney -- excuse me -- of the Attorney General in this case are wholly illusory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.378" offset="13636838">I believe this is very clear statement of the decision of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.952" offset="13659199">Thank you very much, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3394.814" offset="13682604">I’d like to answer two of the contentions raised by the attorney for the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.585" offset="13709667">First of all there is a certain amount of clarity in the institution between people who are once sent to state prison and then for various reasons have to be sent to institutions and one of the examples raised is someone who has to return to the county jail because he is contesting a proposed conviction proceeding while the Court knows the validity of his sentence and he might remain in this county jail for two days or a few weeks depending on how long it takes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.523" offset="13805484">Now, certainly we are not going to say that these people are not to be awarded good time because in the course of their program in the state prison they have to leave for a short instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.863" offset="13842787">In fact, if we did deprive these people of good time, we would be raising serious constitutional problems about denial of access to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.699" offset="13874134">If a inmate in state prison knows that if he wants to utilize a state post-conviction remedy but he would also be losing good time he might be deterred in utilizing that remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3466.835" offset="13970683">I would like to add one more thing and before lunch, the argument was made that the time allowance committee operates solely as the punitive entity it does not at all.</text>
