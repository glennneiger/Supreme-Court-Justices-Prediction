            <text syncTime="28.304" offset="216586">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.185" offset="228080">The question presented by these cases, is whether state prisoners complaining about the matter of their confinement should be able to obtain equitable relief under the Civil Rights Act given the applicability of the federal habeas corpus statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.476" offset="289311">When these actions were commenced, each of the respondents was confined in a state prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.986" offset="311359">Each was in custody pursuant to a valid state court judgment of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.083" offset="331734">Each have been deprived of good-conduct-time-credits by the Department of Correction as a result of a disciplinary action of each and each immediately proceeded to the Federal District Court with a combined petition for a writ of habeas corpus and civil rights complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.880" offset="398921">In each case, the District Court held a hearing and granted relief on the merits rejecting the State’s argument that the actions were in the nature of habeas corpus applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.105" offset="447822">Each of the respondents was released from physical confinement as a result of the District Court’s decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.918" offset="475094">Individual panels of the Second Circuit heard appeals by the State taken in all three cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.374" offset="500903">The panels which reviewed Rodriguez and Katzoff reversed the District Court on the ground that the applications were in the nature of habeas corpus petitions and there had been a failure to exhaust state court remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.357" offset="556805">Before Kritsky was decided, a motion to en banc Rodriguez and Katzoff was granted and Kritsky was ordered included in the en banc consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.944" offset="599124">Counsel were directed to brief and be prepare to argue two specific questions unrelated to the merits of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.163" offset="636008">The first was the applicability of the doctrine of abstention and the second was the need to exhaust state court remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.312" offset="664639">After this Court’s decision in Wilwording against Swenson, the Circuit Court reversed the panel decisions in Rodriguez and Katzoff and affirmed the District Court in all three cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.535" offset="709465">It is evident from the eight opinions that were written by the court below that until this Court decided Wilwording.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.707" offset="734229">The second Circuit was evenly divided in considering this case by vote of 66 on the question of whether the claims raised should first have been presented to the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.975" offset="779264">And what’s even more interesting is aside form the diverse opinion -- the division of opinion between the members of the Court is the fact that even among those who were very firm in their belief that the state should first have considered these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.419" offset="845093">There was no agreement as to whether exhaustion of remedies was required under the habeas corpus statute or whether exhaustion of remedy should be required under the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.193" offset="884172">Judges Friendly, Mansfield and Mulligan believe that these are all habeas corpus petitions and that the exhaustion requirement of Section 2254 is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.900" offset="927013">Judges Lumbard, Moore, and Hayes believe that these might be considered as civil right actions but that in any event, despite the earlier decisions of this Court exhaustion of state judicial remedies was an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.808" offset="982601">After Wilwording, a majority of the court below felt that they were bound to accept the inmate’s choice of remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.442" offset="1009142">And based upon these earlier decisions of this Court, held that exhaustion of state judicial remedies was not required in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.595" offset="1041742">Petitioner seek reversal of the decision below on the ground that choice of remedy should not lay with the inmate as it presently does because any claim that he may raise regarding the legality of his custody is essentially in the nature of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.867" offset="1106840">Custody is at the heart of the habeas corpus statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.245" offset="1120319">Section 2241 says, “The writ of habeas corpus shall not extend to a prisoner unless he is in custody in violation of the constitution.”</text>
            <text syncTime="262.741" offset="1154382">Section 2254 says, “That a Federal Court shall not entertain an application for writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court conviction only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.986" offset="1231287">The decisions of this Court which we cite in our brief make it clear that custody as it is used in the statute refers not simply to the reason -- the inmate is being confined, but to all the incidents of confinement as well Wilwording against Swenson reaffirmed this in the context of the Eighth Amendment claims that were there raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.867" offset="1314879">Actually, the respondents in this case do not deny the validity of this classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.882" offset="1338911">So much as they fear the application of the exhaustion requirement of Section 2254 and the arguments which they raised in reply to the question which the state has presented to the court and which is really not so much the invention of the state in this case as it is the concern of the Circuit Court which en banc these cases relate to the exhaustion requirement and whether or not there is any detriment to the inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.115" offset="1451865">The reason which they emphasize the most and which I believe to be the least tenable was that there will be a delay to the state prisoner in reaching a federal form.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.586" offset="1501706">The reason I feel that this is the least tenable is that delay in reaching a federal court for a state prisoner or for any citizen has relevance only in so far as there is no adequate state court remedy.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="362.254" offset="1552384">Mrs. Cohen, is this a question that should be decided by this Court just on the basis of competing policy considerations or it is basically statutory inquiry as to what congress has provide?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lillian_zeisel_cohen" startTime="375.832" stopTime="409.868">
            <label>Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen</label>
            <text syncTime="375.832" offset="1606719">Well, I commenced my argument with the reading from the statute of sections that I am sure this bench is very familiar with.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.278" offset="1640469">I think that initially, the proper classification of this case is determined by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.226" offset="1668263">In this case, you have a habeas corpus statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.957" offset="1679235">The essence of that statute is custody and its custody in the context of a state court judgment of conviction and the sentence which follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.282" offset="1712462">Therefore, I think that the jumping of point for any consideration of where state prisoner claim should be presented is the habeas corpus statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.655" offset="1742033">Of course --</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="409.868" stopTime="413.378">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="409.868" offset="1742869">Even with a state prisoner isn’t attacking the judgment under which he is concluded?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lillian_zeisel_cohen" startTime="413.378" stopTime="475.317">
            <label>Ms. Lillian Z. Cohen</label>
            <text syncTime="413.378" offset="1756871">Yes, I think that based upon the decisions of this Court, we have passed the point where conceptually the habeas corpus statute or legally the habeas corpus statute is devoted simply to a state court judgment of conviction in sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.788" offset="1818520">I think this Court made that clear as I said in Wilwording against Swenson in the context of Eighth Amendment claims it did so on the context of Johnson against Avery which raised the question about the constitutionality of the -- a state prison regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.973" offset="1879228">And as I say, I don’t believe that respondents really denied the appropriateness of this classification that if you -- they don’t claim that these cases are not properly habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.418" offset="1937011">I suppose if you ask them which category they would prefer to the end, they would say that if they have to really choose one of the other -- their choice would lie with the Civil Rights Act, but that simply because the decisions of this Court today are that the exhaustion of state judicial remedies would not be required.</text>

            <text syncTime="1505.396" offset="6124962">The average in the ordinary civil rights action has no comparison, it’s much slower.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.044" offset="6151502">The reason that petitioners are urging this Court to hold that an exhaustion requirement is applicable is because it is -- it places the responsibility with the state which is where I belong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.541" offset="6213569">It’s the state court which placed these people in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.336" offset="6224750">It’s the state which should decide the limits and the incidence of the sentences it imposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.949" offset="6243140">The good-conduct-cases are perfect example of this because as we heard in the prior case considered by this Court today, things like good time parole eligibility, all enter into the sentencing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.312" offset="6288593">There is a direct relationship there between sentences has imposed by state court and how sentence is carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.110" offset="6311790">It’s in that situation that we think that the state court have the responsibility to decide on these cases first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.256" offset="6332374">Another example, our case is involving the place of confinement where a man is claiming that, “I should not be in a state prison, I should be in a hospital or I should be in the narcotics addiction control center.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.251" offset="6372394">Here, you are talking about the very justification for sentence and you are talking about something where the responsibility lies with the state courts which impose these sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.030" offset="6411473">And similarly, the reason -- another reason for requiring this is that the state is regulating virtually every aspect of the inmate’s confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.665" offset="6458075">Unlike, any comparable situation for the ordinary citizen you have the state, a situation where virtually every action which is taken with respect to the inmate is state action and lends itself to litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.706" offset="6510216">If there is no exhaustion requirement, it seems to me that the federal courts are going to have to bear the burden of these cases and there are going to have to become involved in this very complex regulatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.485" offset="6549295">The need to have some guidelines for considering these cases, I think was expressed with great urgency by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.373" offset="6580851">And I think that they are asking this Court for guidance and we believe that the answer to their problem lies in the habeas corpus statute not with Congress, but with the statute which is already on the books and which is applicable and that cases challenging conditions of confinement no less than cases challenging conviction share a common denominator which is custody and that they belong under the habeas corpus statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1652.692" offset="6714180">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.866" offset="6726823">I should first like if I may to take a minute or two, to give some of the facts underlying these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.593" offset="6749706">Because although the only issue before this Court is the jurisdictional issue, the only issue on which cert was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.117" offset="6775829">The lower court, the Court of Appeals and its en banc decision affirmed all three cases on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.714" offset="6802265">And the merits were argued in several bound. But the first two cases, Kritsky and Rodriguez involved very serious disciplinary due process issues in which men were denied good time on cases which the District Court and affirmed by the Circuit Court found were grossly deficient procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.754" offset="6882408">Mr. Katzoff who received relief very quickly by the way was punished with 60 days good time loss and 60 days in a solitary confinement for writing two mildly with derogatory comments, “creep and cigar-smoking S. O. B.” in diaries which he did not circulate and which as the Court of Appeals and District Court found every institution in which he had been permitted him to keep.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.161" offset="6992018">Those are the merits, now, and each of those three cases, the Circuit Court affirmed on the merits after discussion and consideration of both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.778" offset="7026500">Now, what the State is asking in this case is really very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.495" offset="7045308">It is asking the Court to repudiate a long line of well-established principles most reasonably reaffirmed last term in two cases in Wilwording and in the footnote in Humphrey and Cady footnote 18, to the effect that a state prisoner can challenged the conditions of confinement under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.793" offset="7130572">We are not urging this Court to reclassify every case of 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.440" offset="7153142">We do not deny that habeas corpus may be available, this Court set so last term and that’s not the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.351" offset="7184802">The issue in this case is whether every habeas corpus case shall every prisoner’s rights case, every 1983 case shall be carved out of the jurisdiction of 1983 and construe not the way this Court, not the way untold the lower court have construed this namely as 1983 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.664" offset="7265991">But you can construe them as habeas corpus cases requiring an exhaustion requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.067" offset="7287620">And we say as Mr. Justice Brennan pointed out, the statute was enacted in 1871.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.302" offset="7312593">It was obviously no thought at that time, I am quite sure to deal with prisoner’s cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.552" offset="7333595">They obviously were dealing with problems of friction between federal and state courts as it was pointed in Mitchum and Foster quite clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.482" offset="7361285">And it was very clear that they gave a federal form and what was then and almost revolutionary change in the federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.179" offset="7392110">A federal forth of federal rights and without having to go all the way through the state system and in 1961, in Monroe and Pape and in every case since then including three prisoner cases Houghton and Shafer, Wilwording and Humphrey and Cady which raised the related problems about the proper place of confinement for someone committed under the -- was Wisconsin Sexually Deviant Act and every one of these case, this Court has said flatly there is no requirement of exhaustion of either administrative or judicial remedies.</text>

            <text syncTime="1864.700" offset="7562219">No, Your Honor, that’s very clearly habeas corpus position not because of the nature of the classification, but because of the policy involved in the exhaustion doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.268" offset="7600462">The policy in the exhaustion doctrine is very clear, it’s to avoid friction between the judgment of a state court which it has entered or which has its holding somebody in custody and the judgment of a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.791" offset="7654588">That was the basis to correct Ex parte Royal and that’s what involved and that’s why several court have said that when an attempt was made to challenge a conviction under 1983, that was really in attempt to evade and we would say, we quite agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.645" offset="7721984">An attempt to evade simply should not be permitted because then it’s time to evade the exhaustion requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.957" offset="7743195">But what we are dealing with here and this is the essence of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.122" offset="7755839">We are dealing with administrative action which of course in a variety of settings with the variety of consequences and with the variety of remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.210" offset="7792201">The question about damages was absolutely on point in terms of what’s at stake here because these are damage actions as well as equitable actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.646" offset="7825951">It depends on whether the thing is monetary, but whatever benefits are sought to be gained from an exhaustion requirement would immediately be defeated by that and not because it’s a question of evading it but because according to the state’s own argument both remedies are available, always both forms are available and every 1983, every challenge to conditions can obviously be a challenge for monetary damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.315" offset="7928665">The fact is that the state in its brief go somewhat far did they went in oral argument because what they said is if there is a damage claim, one has to go in to the state court to get the merits decided and then into federal court to get damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.134" offset="7991881">Now, the claim is like this is habeas corpus because it’s custody.</text>

            <text syncTime="2594.200" offset="10480201">The most -- in some ways the most interesting aspect of the state’s argument is the request for an exhaustion of administrative remedies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2928.962" offset="11819238">There are two points that I would like to reply to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.636" offset="11833866">First, contrary to what counsel has suggested, we are not asking this Court to overrule the Wilwording decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.136" offset="11859884">The specific holding of Wilwording is entirely consistent with our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.753" offset="11878379">The claims there were habeas corpus claims, the question was whether or not the exhaustion requirement applied and this Court held that the claims were recognizable as habeas corpus claims and in fact that the exhaustion requirement applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.555" offset="11929579">It is the dictum in Wilwording that we are asking this Court to reconsider and just as a point of interest, I would like to tell the Court that in the Wilwording, on the remand despite the dictum of this Court, the parties and the Court are still considering these cases as habeas corpus petitions because of the res judicata problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.190" offset="12008155">The second point I would like to reply to is the figures that were cited by counsel with regard to the numbers of cases that are being brought in the federal courts right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.548" offset="12049533">The fact is that the figures cited in the American Bar Association Study seem to show a drop in the rate of increase of prisoner’s civil rights actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.251" offset="12096345">And to me that suggests a real -- a substantial reply to the concern of counsel for respondents that these claims are not being reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.702" offset="12138141">Prison conditions have not changed overnight, the prison population has not decreased overnight and yet there are less of these claims coming in to the federal courts in the last two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.296" offset="12176593">Then must be being decided some place and it seems to me that what is happening is that in line with the change that has been reflected in recent decisions, it’s not only the federal courts but also of the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.602" offset="12229778">You are getting prison conditions corrected by state administrators and or by state courts and I think that’s a response to the exhaustion object that’s being raised today.</text>
