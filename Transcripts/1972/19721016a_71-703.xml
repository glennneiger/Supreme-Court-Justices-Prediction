            <label>Mr. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="80.491" offset="425357">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.546" offset="437582">This is a direct appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Colorado which at trial dismissed a government antitrust suit, challenging a bank merger is violating Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.423" offset="493066">The merger involved the acquisition by the First Bancorporation of Colorado, the second largest bank holding company in Colorado of the First National Bank of Greeley which is the second largest bank in the City of Greeley.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.492" offset="561298">The holding company which I shall refer to as Bancorporation, does not, through any of its subsidiaries, operate in the City of Greeley.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.493" offset="593377">So, this means that the acquiring firm and the acquired firm are not themselves direct competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.723" offset="622216">The theory of the government's case, was that the Bancorporation was a potential entrant into the Greeley market and that by acquiring the bank in Greeley, the effect was to remove the competitive effect, that the presence of this potential entrant had on the outside of the market on the theory that had it not been for the acquisition, there was a reasonable probability that this acquiring firm, the holding company, would either itself have entered the market for acquiring a small bank or from opening a new bank in the Greeley area.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="172.582" offset="793684">Mr. Friedman, does the fact that some acquisition is made automatically make the acquiring entity a potential entrant?</text>

            <text syncTime="181.460" offset="829210">No, no, of course not, of course, not Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.492" offset="841331">The -- first of all, our argument is that, in view of all the circumstances shown here, under the proper standard, in fact, this corporation was a potential entrant at the time it made the acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.864" offset="890859">We do not say that the mere fact that made the acquisition made it a potential entrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.240" offset="908309">What we do say is, that in this kind of a situation, where the firm, as I shall develop, was interested in the market, whereas an attractive market, where as the record shows, they were interested in going into all the markets and where it was an attractive thing to prudent management that is enough to make it, we think, a potential entrant, And then the next question, of course, is whether the elimination of that potential entrant may have the effect substantially, to lessen competition in violation of Section 7.</text>

            <label>Mr. Friedman</label>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="249.006" offset="1099421">Well, I think I understand it, but I hadn't seen any -- it didn't ring any bells with me in opinions of this Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="253.559" offset="1117602">No -- well, I think this Court does not say so, but the concept is a very simple, one which is, if you have concentrated market, where two or three firms own a major share of the -- have a major share of the business as it's true in Greeley, if an outside firm comes in and merely succeeds to the share of the market held by one of these large firms, this merely solidifies the existing relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.334" offset="1236720">It tends to -- to tie up the existing structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.566" offset="1257618">On the other hand, if a large firm comes into the market by acquiring a smaller firm in the market, this means that the only way of the large firm can hope to achieve a substantial share of the market is by engaging in very vigorous competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.744" offset="1322297">And it also, it seems to me self-evident that a very large firm is not going to acquire a small firm in the market unless it believes and hopes that it can build it up, and these are -- the theory of it that this kind of an entry will inject into the market a new competitive force which is not present in the usual concentrated market.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="325.920" offset="1407039">In your view, is it even better to be a foothold entrant than an independent entrant, from the point of view of Section 7?</text>

            <text syncTime="335.251" offset="1444342">Both of them, we think, both of them we think are desirable in changing the structure of concentrated markets, in a sense -- in a sense, perhaps, the acquisition of a small little firm in the market which up to this time by definition has not been a very effective competitor, that's almost the equivalent of going in by yourself because you start with a little one that says, though, you just started it and try to build it up, and get a larger share of the market and compete vigorously in this market.</text>

            <text syncTime="390.965" offset="1667218">It's basically a factual one Mr. Justice, but we think in resolving that question, Judge Doyle, we think, applied the wrong standards for determining, what is a potential entrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.552" offset="1713612">That -- that is, we think the judge applied what we call the subjective standard, the standard based on the express intent of the corporate official, as the official as to what they would do, and we don't think that is the proper standard as I shall develop in the light of the congressional purposes in such so.</text>

            <label>Mr. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="426.566" offset="1809638">He -- he spoke of objective evidence, but I -- I think Mr. Justice, once again, what he meant by objective evidence was largely the -- the testimony plus the fact that he was impressed, I think, by what he felt was the unlikelihood in terms of the management-stated prior program and of plans of their going in.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.536" offset="1897514">He -- he did not, it seems, to us, address himself to the standards that we think are the controlling of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.188" offset="1924159">Now, I would like just by a way of background, give a little bit of the history of the bank merger movement in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.111" offset="1951848">In the late, in the year, we -- in late 1950s, we had a tremendous way of back mergers in the major cities of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.940" offset="1983091">Competing banks joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.548" offset="1989569">They formed these huge banks and manufactures, hand over Morgan Guaranty in New York and this merger went on for awhile and finally the government began to bring suits against these mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.850" offset="2038784">And when this Court in 1963 decided in the Philadelphia Bank case, that Section 7 of the Clayton Act applied to bank mergers, that basically marked the end of this aspect of the bank merger movement in this country, because that case established the two large banks having a significant share of the market where competitors cannot combine.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="505.780" offset="2126451">When did you say that the present day movement began more or less?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="friedman" startTime="510.271" stopTime="511.436">

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <label>Mr. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="511.628" offset="2149857">-- began in the late 1940s to the early 1950s.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.443" offset="2161142">But the next phase of this movement, which I am coming to, I think began in the early 1960s.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.621" offset="2185906">And that was the tendency by the large banks in the big cities to move into many of the local regional markets, the smallest cities by the acquisition of the most important banks in those areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.400" offset="2249017">That is in states with permitted branch-banking a large bank would move into a local area by buying the first, the second, the third, largest bank in the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.741" offset="2294366">In areas that did not permit branch-banking, the holding company movement developed whereby a holding company was formed with a large a bank as its nucleus and this holding company in turn proceeded to acquire various banks in the large cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.720" offset="2362284">This trend developed very rapidly and there's an exhibit in the record, defendants exhibit 30, at page 1662, which is a table showing as of the end 1969, the percentages of the total state bank deposits held by the three largest and the five largest banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.135" offset="2443891">And this shows that in 17 states, one-third of the states by 1969, 17 -- I'm sorry, the three largest banking organizations in the state had more than 50% of the total deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.037" offset="2511496">And in 24 states, it was the five largest banks that had more than that percentage of the deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.597" offset="2537723">Now, this trend was also present in Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.541" offset="2557576">In 1960, there was one holding company operating in Colorado that had three banks and 4.4% of the deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.648" offset="2593938">By 1970, there were seven holding companies operating in Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.438" offset="2621106">They had 41 banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.970" offset="2627271">And while the 41 banks were less than one-fifth of the total banks in the state, they had 51% of the deposits in Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.329" offset="2660707">So, we see that what has been happening in Colorado is what has been happening throughout the rest of the country in varying degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.336" offset="2688711">The large banks -- the large banks in the cities through these holding companies have been going out and acquiring major competitors in the local markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.190" offset="2728103">Now, the Greeley area itself, has felt this trend.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.622" offset="2741896">There are eight banking organizations in Greeley, prior to this acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.202" offset="2764152">Four of them were owned by two Colorado holding companies and they had 60% of the deposits in the Greeley area.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.977" offset="2799261">And it's against this background, this history, of a merger movement in the banking field that the acquisition by more and more of the local banking leaders throughout the state, that the effect of this merger in the Greeley area must be -- get based.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.791" offset="2858506">Now Denver is the commercial and banking center of Colorado, but in addition to this, there were six other important banking centers, smaller cities in Colorado of which Greeley is one.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.897" offset="2914931">The holding company was formed in 1968 by the officials of the principal bank in the system, the First National Bank which is the second largest bank in the City of -- I'm sorry, it's above myself -- is the largest bank in the City of Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.167" offset="2983999">It's a bank with assets of approximately $500 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.277" offset="3004479">It also has three smaller banks in the Denver suburbs which were organized by the people who were the principals of the First National Bank of Denver prior to the time the holding company was formed.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.387" offset="3060903">And in his deposition, the president of the holding company testified that one reason his people formed this holding company was because of the trend in Colorado of other bank holding companies acquiring banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.109" offset="3111790">That's shown at page 535 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.057" offset="3127568">Now, in its first annual report to its stockholders, the -- the holding company explained what its purpose was, what it was going to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.982" offset="3159333">It said and this is at page 513 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.370" offset="3172812">He said, “The policy of our company is to expand as rapidly and as wisely as possible, through the acquisition of other banks in Colorado and it's a (Inaudible) banks which held out of good potential for growth and through other legally permissible investments and activities.”</text>
            <text syncTime="784.535" offset="3241462">Now, this thought was repeated in a deposition, again, given by the president of the holding company which he said at pages 535 to 536 of the record, “We would like to have a bank in the major cities of Colorado.”</text>
            <text syncTime="798.971" offset="3299244">They want -- they wanted a bank in major cities of Colorado and he also listed various other areas where they would like to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.931" offset="3327143">And then he was asked whether in their plans the holding company had ruled out the possibility of de novo expansion, because the report, they spoke about acquiring other banks and he said, “No, we haven't ruled out that possibility.”</text>
            <text syncTime="818.535" offset="3377507">The first step in this program of expanding into the various local areas was the acquisition in Greeley.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.136" offset="3399868">That was the first one.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.007" offset="3407391">Since that time, Bancorporation has attempted to acquire five other banks in various areas of Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.649" offset="3441977">Two of the proposed acquisitions were the largest banks in the particular areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.457" offset="3461204">Two others were of the second largest banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.846" offset="3470712">They've not been successful in this in endeavor, and one of them, they were able to accomplish.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.706" offset="3490147">At two instances, the regulatory authorities turned them down.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.789" offset="3502477">In one instance, the acquisition was approved, but was abandoned when the Government filed a suit, and the last one, we still have a suit against it pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.199" offset="3532152">But to us, the significant setting is to show that the First Bancorporation was not just sitting idly by with its three or four banks and waiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.333" offset="3568724">It was going out trying to acquire other banks in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.799" offset="3586591">Now, the City of Greeley is 15 miles, approximately north of Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.721" offset="3610206">The city has a population of 38,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.921" offset="3623058">The Greeley area which has certain surrounding communities which the District Court held here to be the relevant market has a population of 58,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.100" offset="3659734">It has mainly been an agricultural community, but in the last decade, industry has come up in substantial measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.916" offset="3695052">The areas had a good, steady growth as we set out in our brief at page 9, to give some statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.988" offset="3727339">And this is an area that is attractive to Bancorporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.250" offset="3744371">Now, our opponent suggests that there was no particular reason why this company should have gone into Greeley, that there are more attractive markets involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.127" offset="3779897">But I would like to read to the Court two quotations.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.124" offset="3795884">Unfortunately, we did not cite this in our brief from page 555.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.452" offset="3821171">And this is the man named “Adams” who is the present of the First National Bank of Denver and a previous president of the Bancorporation, and he was asked on this deposition why the bank was interested in acquiring the Bank in Greeley, and what he said was in the middle of the page, “We were very anxious as I say to get into the Greeley area, because it is one of the best towns in Northern Colorado and has been for many, many, many years a great agricultural area and a fine area.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.393" offset="3940916">And we would very much like to have a unit up there in Greeley.”</text>
            <text syncTime="962.858" offset="3954813">That at the bottom of the page he repeated this quote, when he said, “It is one of the growth areas of Colorado and we'd like to be in it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="971.570" offset="3989608">Now, the Greeley market, as I indicated before, is a concentrated market.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.418" offset="4009044">The three principle banking organizations have 92% of the deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.221" offset="4032240">The acquired bank, First National of Greeley is approximately the same size as the larger bank within a -- a 10th of 1%, percentage wise, roughly, 32% of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.663" offset="4078007">And the First National Bank is the only bank in the area, the only largest bank in the area that is not owned by a holding company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.454" offset="4121161">Now, the District Court in deciding this case stated that the issue was whether if there would be -- there would be, not there may be, he said, “Whether there would be a substantial lessening of competition”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.622" offset="4169853">And the Court concluded that the Government had to show that the acquisition in question has the effect, substantially, to lessen competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.805" offset="4206634">Now, the Court agreed with the Government that commercial banking is the relevant product market and found, although, the Government had suggested two alternatives, found that the Greeley area was the relevant geographical market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.013" offset="4259401">The District Court also recognized that the elimination of a potential competitor may have the effect of substantially lessening competition in violation of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.057" offset="4299630">The Court said, “Where the concentration is high, the merger removes the potential competitor as a restraining influence and the anticompetitive effects can be significant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.076" offset="4343724">The court went it on -- and they hold however, that this merger did not eliminate a substantial competitor, sorry, a substantial entrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.210" offset="4376221">Since the Court said that the evidence was uncontradicted that Bancorporation has no intention of entering the Greeley market if this acquisition is disapproved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.772" offset="4414464">And we think primarily that the District Court relied on two bits of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.832" offset="4434735">One was the testimony of an official of Bancorporation that they would not enter the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.102" offset="4459813">And secondly, the testimony of state regulatory officials which the District Court interpreted as indicating, they would not charter a new bank in the Greeley area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.100" offset="4503803">The Court did not reach because of its disposition that the Government had not shown anticompetitive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.355" offset="4532746">The second issue under the Bank Holding Company Act is the same as under the Bank Merger Act whether any anticompetitive effect of the acquisition are clearly outweighed by the effect of the merger in serving the convenience and needs of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.945" offset="4587186">So, that issue has not been resolved and if the Court agrees with us that the wrong standards were applied then the case has to be remanded, that is an issue for the District Court to deal with on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.156" offset="4632012">The court also rejected an alternative ground on which the Government challenged the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.574" offset="4653641">That is, that the effect of this merger was to foreclose to competing large banks in Colorado, so-called correspondent banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.959" offset="4699199">That is the practice by which the large city banks perform various cervices for the country banks, such as clearing checks, making loans in excess of the local banks, when it's giving them investment advice, serving as a depository for various funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.364" offset="4764818">And the Government claims that by preempting the correspondent banking business of first, of Greeley, the effect of the merger was to foreclose to the other banks in Colorado a significant important share of this business and that in the light of the trend toward concentration in the Colorado banking field, this also had an anticompetitive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.212" offset="4856247">This argument is a rather detailed and technical one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.702" offset="4870144">It turns on questions of defining the market on disputes as to the irrelevant statistics involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.670" offset="4894072">It's not particularly appropriate for oral argument and I propose to leave that discussion to the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.565" offset="4925628">Now, as I indicated, the District Court didn't question that the elimination of potential competition may substantially lessen the competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.666" offset="4961991">And this Court has repeatedly so indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.886" offset="4974947">And as I've also indicated, we think the primary issue in this case, therefore, is the standard for determining whether a firm is a potential entrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.098" offset="5023744">The 1950 Amendments, the (Inaudible) Act, to Section of 7 of the Clayton Act, reflected the rising concern -- I'm sorry, the concern of Congress over the rising trend of concentration in American industry and Congress was concerned that this trend or concentration would result in a further weakening of a normal -- forces of competition in the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.212" offset="5136175">And accordingly, Congress strengthened the prohibitions of the Clayton Act against mergers which may have an anticompetitive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.040" offset="5171493">The purpose of Section 7 as amended was to maintain the structure of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.059" offset="5195630">Unlike such in one of the Sherman Act which is directed to conduct in the market anticompetitive acts, we think Section 7 is designed to preserve the structure, to avoid changes in the organization of the market that pose a serious danger of anticompetitive effects as it's repeatedly been stated in Section 7. In 1950, congress was concerned with -- not with certainties but with probabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.142" offset="5307956">It was designed to stop these things in their incipiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.355" offset="5324779">Now, in a market where you have many sellers, a large number of sellers, none of whom has any significant major share of the market, normally, we know that competition plays the role of regulating the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.238" offset="5388309">But when you get into these concentrative markets, where a small number of sellers have the major share of the market and each one has a very large share, economic theory teaches that in that situation, what's likely to develop is not the normal competition but parallel policies, easy accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.976" offset="5467303">And therefore, traditionally markets that have a small number of firms with a large share are not characterized by the kind of vigorous competition normally found in traditional markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.399" offset="5521011">And that principle, that concentration is inimicable to the free play of competitive forces is also applicable to banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.769" offset="5554448">As this Court stated in the Philadelphia Bank case, there is no reason to think that concentration is less inimicable to the free play of competition in banking than in any other services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.109" offset="5599796">Now, as I have indicated, the potential entrants standing on the outside of a concentrated market has two roles to play, two roles in preserving the competitive structure of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.729" offset="5658311">First of all, standing outside the market inevitably plays an influence on the people inside the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.017" offset="5691434">That is the firms inside the market who have this great economic power are well aware that if they abused it, if they get too greedy in their practices, there's always the danger of this strong firm coming in and taking away from the firms that hold a major share of the market, a section of that market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.973" offset="5771264">And indeed this Court and its Penn-Olin opinion at 378 U.S. at page 174, quoted with approval from a T.N.E.C. monograph written 30 years ago which directly reflected that principle and it's also reflected in the testimony of our economic expert, Professor Welch.</text>

            <text syncTime="1458.218" offset="5936253">That, in fact -- that's one of our major contentions is, that we think that Bancorporation instead of acquiring this large firm, this is one of, we think, one of the proper ways for a large firm to get into a concentrated market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.026" offset="5995499">This firm has been charted by a small holding company, a small holding company in Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.181" offset="6024129">The claim is that Bancorporation couldn't have gotten a charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.766" offset="6042415">That's one of the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.911" offset="6047013">They rely -- they say that the testimony by the state banking commission indicates that because charters had been turned down in other localities, there was no chance that a charter would have been granted for another bank Greeley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.123" offset="6103855">Less than a year later, lo and behold, someone did come in and seek a charter for new bank in Greeley and it was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.351" offset="6128828">And there's no reason to think that if Bancorporation instead of seeking to make this acquisition had itself going in, looked for an application for new a charter that it wouldn't have been granted, too.</text>

            <text syncTime="1527.031" offset="6211480">What we do contend is that Greeley was a growing area where there's room for additional banks, and that the creation of new competition in Greeley would tend to shake up this market which had been relatively static before then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.241" offset="6272293">Now, the other role of a potential competitor play one role -- the potential competitor sits on the outside and in effect inhibits anticompetitive behavior by the large firms in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.728" offset="6322239">The other role, equally significant, is if the potential competitor enters the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.478" offset="6341256">If a potential competitor enters the market, either by acquiring a small bank or by itself organizing the bank, this again tends to inject into what has been basically and not very competitive off the market, a new competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.348" offset="6404786">Now, of course, as long as the potential competitor remains outside, it has these salutary purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.619" offset="6433834">But once it enters by acquiring a market leader, two things happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.013" offset="6455463">Whatever effect it has staying on the outside disappears and the possibility of any vigorous and new competition by creation of a new competitor disappears.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.612" offset="6497782">All at you have in this type of a situation is that the outside powerful firm comes in and takes over the market share of one of the major banks in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.079" offset="6551698">Now, the significance that an outside potential entrant has on competition in the market, basically depends on the relationship between this bank and the structure of the market, That is, what kind of a market is it, what is its role on the outside, is it a concentrated market of the facts such as to indicate that the bank is likely to come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.765" offset="6666428">And that of course it seems to me is the kind of a question that has to be determined on the basis of the objective evidence in the case, not on the basis of the intent of the parties -- the stated intent of the firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.796" offset="6722539">It seems to us that this is just not the way in which this kind of a determination should be made.</text>

            <text syncTime="1683.372" offset="6836851">It is -- is asked in this case, as is, had you not been permitted to make the acquisition, would you have gone in either through making a small acquisition or by organizing your own bank.</text>

            <label>Mr. Friedman</label>

            <text syncTime="1847.678" offset="7494092">It's -- it's obviously of subsequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.536" offset="7501511">Let me explain another thing here, another reason why we think this kind of intent testimony is not, preferably persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.815" offset="7534634">One of the effects, one of the substantial impacts that the presence of an outside competitor has is on the conduct of the people in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.869" offset="7574862">The knowledge of this and the outside competitor on the (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.613" offset="7589804">And the people who are in the market have to make their judgment, have to influence their practices on the basis of what they judge from the objective evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.935" offset="7635153">That is, they look and see what kind of a firm in this, what is happening in the market, whether it has the capacity to come in, whether it looks like the kind of an opportunity -- would be attractive for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.301" offset="7680606">They don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.364" offset="7684786">They don't know and can't make their business judgments on the basis of what may be in the minds of the officials of the outside company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.243" offset="7728358">Now, I think one other bit of evidence that is quite significant in deciding how you evaluate these claims that they wouldn't go in, otherwise, is what has actually happened in Colorado and in other states where bank holding companies have sought and been denied permission to the enter the markets, to acquiring a large share.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.765" offset="7818428">And when that was turned down and that failed they would then go in and try to acquire a smaller bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.468" offset="7841207">A very interesting example is this very holding company, Bancorporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.961" offset="7863254">And in addition, United Banks of Colorado, the largest holding company in this state, each of them tried to acquire one of the leading banks in a large community, failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.633" offset="7905886">And then preceeded to try to acquire and succeeded a much smaller bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.405" offset="7928978">Bancorporation tried to acquire the leading bank in Colorado Springs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.178" offset="7948100">And it's -- I -- I'm sorry, the second largest bank in Colorado Springs, and when it, in its application to the Federal Reserve Board, it said it would be imprudent for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.776" offset="7982477">Imprudent was the word they'd used, to try to get into the market either by acquiring a smaller bank or by opening its own bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.069" offset="8011630">The Fed approved that, but the merger was abandoned when the Government filed an antitrust suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.174" offset="8040051">Bancorporation then turned around and applied for and got permission, to acquire a bank in Colorado Springs that was one-seventh the size of the bank they originally had sought.</text>

            <text syncTime="2040.144" offset="8263973">One last point I would make is the testimony of the regulatory officials, of the court relied on.</text>

            <text syncTime="2055.906" offset="8326980">Well, regulatory officials decide questions of whether they charter a new bank on the basis on an application to that is filed to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.493" offset="8353311">They consider all the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.333" offset="8360730">They have also sorts of detailed specifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.016" offset="8371388">All he said was that he wouldn't recommend to his superior the controller of the currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.458" offset="8389256">It's the controller of the currency who makes the decision.</text>
