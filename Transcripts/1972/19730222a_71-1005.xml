            <text syncTime="37.536" offset="253471">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.050" offset="267577">The facts in this criminal case are a bit complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.805" offset="286595">Essentially, they arise from an incident which occurred in Benton Harbor, Michigan on November 5, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.895" offset="314911">Two police officers were driving in their patrol car, stopped a Pontiac automobile, got out of their automobile and, as they were walking up to the Pontiac, the driver and passenger of that vehicle jumped out and began firing at them striking both officers, critically wounding both.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.955" offset="407176">Both did survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.791" offset="418565">Later that day, incidentally, it might be noted at this point that after the officers have been hit, they did fire their guns at the retreating vehicle, Pontiac.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.278" offset="476453">Later that day, Leroy Payne, the defendant in this case was arrested, a confession was obtained from him illegally, and before Judge Phil Hadsol, the Byron County Circuit Court, he pled guilty on December 14, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.422" offset="569031">In February 1963, he gave testimony against his co-defendant, Lionel Bradford.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.971" offset="603303">In March 8, 1963, he was sentenced to 19-40 years by Judge Hadsol.</text>

            <text syncTime="151.271" offset="708420">Subsequently, in 1967, Mr. Payne appealed to the Michigan Court of Appeals and in May 12th of that year, 1967, the remand order was entered by that Court to the Byron County Circuit Court for an evidentiary hearing on the question of the voluntariness of his confession and the voluntariness of his plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.743" offset="814373">Then, Circuit Judge Chester Burns conducted that evidentiary hearing in 1967, suppressed the confession, vacated the plea, and set the case down for preliminary examination, whereupon, it proceeded normally to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.496" offset="893367">Prior to trial, the same circuit judge, upon motion of the defendant, granted the change of venue to Grand Rapids which is Kent County, Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.396" offset="948955">At the trial, certain evidence was entered by the people and by the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.669" offset="974033">I will get to that evidence later in my argument, if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.239" offset="992319">He was convicted by a jury selected from Kent County.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.473" offset="1013217">He was sentenced on August 30, 1967 to a term of 25-50 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.574" offset="1201716">In fact, there was great deal of cross-examination in the second trial which led up to, but did not come-- did not even in the remote sense mentioned, the fact that he had testified in the prior trial or of any prior proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="361.453" offset="1549145">On June 23-- pardon me, he did appeal that conviction, raising as one of the grounds an excessive sentence the second time around.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.921" offset="1595016">On June 23, 1969, this Court delivered the decision in North Carolina versus Pearce.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.947" offset="1623124">Two days later, June 25, 1969, the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed both the conviction and the sentence, that is, a sentence of Judge Burns.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.612" offset="1673801">The Michigan Supreme Court granted leave and, apparently, unanimously affirmed the conviction, but in a 4-3 decision and reversed the sentence based on an-- their interpretation, the Michigan Supreme Court’s interpretation, of the requirements of North Carolina versus Pearce.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.532" offset="1749452">This Court granted certiorari in October 16, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.692" offset="1778186">The primary issue, which is actually the last issue that I’ve raised in my brief, is that of the retroactivity of North Carolina versus Pearce.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.668" offset="1817997">First of all, I think we can agree that the sentence was properly imposed technically.</text>

            <text syncTime="450.235" offset="1904306">There are two issues dealt with by the Court in North Carolina versus Pearce, first is that of sentencing.</text>

            <text syncTime="479.740" offset="2022379">The second issue is that of whether or not a higher sentence could be imposed on the second sentence after a successful appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.206" offset="2060204">The Court in Pearce, of course, specifically eliminated the question of Double Jeopardy and Equal Protection Clauses as being a bar to that sentence, that increased sentence, but this say that due process requires that certain-- that these sentences be protected or be governed by certain rules, a certain rule, namely that, first of all, it’d be based on objective identifiable conduct occurring after the first sentence and, secondly, that that conduct must appear on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.379" offset="2220910">On January 16 of this year, this Court delivered an opinion in the case of Robinson versus Neil, in which it cited Pearce without mentioning exactly the-- specifically defining how it cited, but it note that Pearce indicated that Benton versus Maryland should be applied retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.518" offset="2325400">The mentioning of North Carolina versus Pearce, we fee, by Mr. Justice Rehnquist, was intended to deal with the double jeopardy aspect of Pearce, that is the sent-- the creditor time served.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.665" offset="2410036">Further in that decision in Robinson, this Court noted that there is some conflict or a difficulty of understanding the retroactivity and prospectivity rulings of this Court, and referred the readers and the-- to the thrust of the Desist versus United States as summarizing the Linkletter type criteria and said that, first of all, we must look to determine whether the Linkletter criteria apply to the question of what right are we dealing with?</text>
            <text syncTime="608.599" offset="2537723">What right or what privilege newly defined are we dealing with?</text>
            <text syncTime="614.747" offset="2562382">Then, we must look to the purpose of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.736" offset="2574294">Desist also emphasized the fact that the purpose of the rule, newly defined, is the most important aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.125" offset="2611911">Looking at the particular right that we have, that is the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause, this Court has not held that, in it of itself, solely by citing and by using-- having a right affected by the Due Process Clause does not, in it of itself, require retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.140" offset="2691950">A particular rule or particular-- the purpose to be served by a particular rule may indicate that retroactivity should take place, but it does not require it.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.383" offset="2748897">It is the contention of the State of Michigan that the Linkletter criteria should be applied here for the following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.410" offset="2777004">First of all, that, as I said, the Due Process Clause does not, in it of itself, require retroactivity, as would, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist noted, as it would with the Double Jeopardy Clause in Waller versus Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.427" offset="2865089">Essentially, the Due Process Clause, in the way it was applied in this case, assures fairness, basic simple fairness, in the imposition of a second sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.761" offset="2906467">We then move to the purpose of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.744" offset="2918379">Essentially, there are two purposes for the North Carolina versus Pearce decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.872" offset="2934888">There are two things that the Court wanted to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.438" offset="2945128">First of all, that is the appellate process, that is, there should not be any unreasonable impediment to the exercise of a right to appeal granted in this case by a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.902" offset="2994970">The Court, as I recall, has not stated that there is a constitutional right to appeal but, when it is applied, it must be applied-- there must be equal access to the Courts, there must be no unreasonable distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.420" offset="3049096">And, the unreasonable distinction here is a reasonable fear that a second sentencing judge will act indicatively against a particular defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.827" offset="3098728">The second purpose is to prevent, to deter, improper vindictive sentences upon defendants solely because they have appealed and want a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.425" offset="3157034">Now, how do we apply the Pearce case and how does it fit within this question of retroactivity?</text>

            <text syncTime="825.566" offset="3405615">The second thing which we are trying to prevent or the Court is trying to prevent in Pearce is the vindictive sentencing.</text>

            <text syncTime="835.090" offset="3443754">First of all, the Court said that the type of material, the factors to be considered by a judge imposing a second sentence should be limited to objective identifiable conduct occurring after the first sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.316" offset="3496626">Actually it didn’t say “limited to it,” it said “based upon.”</text>
            <text syncTime="852.827" offset="3514702">And, secondly, there’s a record making requirement, that is, this material must be placed on the record so that a higher Court can review that the bases for sufficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.896" offset="3566947">Now, retroactivity, it’s our contention, will not further either of these goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.946" offset="3583143">First of all, those who have been, in the past, deterred from appealing are not going to be-- have their wrongs righted by the retroactivity of Pearce to those cases where those who did appeal had their-- had a higher sentence imposed, that is, the actual wrong that the Court is dealing with is the reasonable fear of those-- the deterrence of those who want to appeal but are afraid to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.734" offset="3726294">These are the people who have suffered the appellate wrong that Pearce was trying to avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.986" offset="3751267">Now, making these cases retroactive, making this case retroactive to handle those-- where the defendant did appeal obviously, those who were afraid will never have justice done to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.888" offset="3814902">Secondly, the prospective application of Pearce will satisfy each of the-- satisfy this appellate and of Pearce, that is, from now on we know, we being-- we convicted of crimes, we know that we will not be subject to a vindictive sentence the second time around and we now can prosecute our appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.229" offset="3936319">It should also be noted that if that case-- if Pearce were to be retroactively applied, it would have to be logically a question of each person who was sentenced would then have a right to say-- come in and say, “well, I was deterred because of the fear of reasonable-- unreasonable increase in sentence and, therefore, hear my appeal,” thus, reopening or opening for the first time each sentence at least and each conviction that has ever taken place, in which the defendant presumably is still alive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1860.172" offset="7544038">The basis for the vacation was on the-- that Leroy Payne’s testimony was used to convict Lionel Bradford and Judge Cornelius Kennedy, in vacating the conviction, held that because his confession was brutally beaten out of him, it was as though the state had knowingly used purged testimony to obtain the conviction of Bradford.</text>

            <text syncTime="1910.194" offset="7744136">The answer to that basically is that when Leroy Payne was picked up by the police officers he was in the custody of three various police departments, and there’s no dispute that the reason for vacating his guilty plea in this particular case was because the confession was beaten out of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.882" offset="7802859">As a matter of fact, at Lionel Bradford’s trial, they wanted to introduce pictures taken of Leroy Payne after his confessions and they were excluded because they were inflammatory, that he was in such a brutally beaten condition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1954.222" offset="7920306">And, because of that fact, when he finally did testify at Lionel Bradford’s trial, and he did go to sentencing, he initially intended to sue the police departments for the condition in which the manner which they treated him and he decided not to do so, and--</text>

            <text syncTime="3693.712" offset="14878177">That, if this particular Court is-- will allow lower Courts to take into account internally the lack of remorse that he shows at the second trial or compare it between the plea and the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3741.366" offset="15068871">That, Judge Hadsol was very aware of this particular problem, and to allow perjury to be-- and I think it’s very important to state here, to allow perjury and increase a sentence in a second trial is a very dangerous precedent because anybody who appeals from a guilty plea and then goes to trial and states his reasons and is convicted would necessarily, under that implication, be guilty of perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.708" offset="15150164">It does away completely with the requirements of trying a man for perjury, and that’s a very dangerous precedence whether you’re talking about appellate matters or whether you’re talking about simply the first sentencing matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="4250.932" offset="17107048">With regards to the case of the presentence report, in the argument before Judge Burns and prior to it, in the formal argument, the actual argument before him, before the final ruling was put in the record and included in the appendix, it was suggested to Mr. Benson by myself and also, I believe, by the judge that we would have no objection and we suggested that he come up to this Court and say-- request the Court to free this-- to bring this presentence report to this Court, and so it’s not a question of exhausting all alternatives because that alternative was suggested to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="4310.652" offset="17346017">That’s the way the ruling was made, yes, Your Honor, and the reason for it was that because of Judge Burns’ feelings on the matter of disclosure of presentence reports which eh included in his ruling, the reasons why he feels they should be confidential and to-- namely to protect the sources of the information and not to have these sources dry up and to give the judges as much latitude as possible to consider information, both favorable and unfavorable, to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.360" offset="17480808">With regards to the time between the original plea and the original-- pardon me, the original sentence and the original appeal, there was some doubt as to how long that was.The record will indicate it was three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4360.527" offset="17545488">The case of Murchison was cited several times and we feel that it’s not applicable at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4365.910" offset="17567013">In that case, we’re dealing with the determination by the same judge and only by that judge of whether or not perjury had been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4374.136" offset="17599927">When the first determination was made or the perjured statement or the alleged perjured statement was made in a one-man grand juror situation, there was only one person there to hear the perjury, and that was the one-man grand juror himself and the Court required that that type of proceeding required a full hearing by another judge for the contempt citation to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.942" offset="17711104">And furthermore, with regard to the issue of perjury, I’m not absolutely sure, but I believe that the law in Michigan as it stood at the time of the second trial or the trial was not because it was punishable by life but rather by 15 years and that it was subsequently amended to make it life.</text>
            <text syncTime="4424.030" offset="17799502">I believe there’s some question in that area, but the-- I do not know the citation of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4429.037" offset="17819564">I can’t give it to the Court.</text>
