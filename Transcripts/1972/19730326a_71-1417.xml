            <text syncTime="22.599" offset="193808">Mr. Dunau, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bernard Dunau</label>
            <text syncTime="27.396" offset="212929">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.091" offset="227767">There are two questions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.383" offset="240933">One, where a Union rule prohibits a member from engaging in strike making – strikebreaking, may that rule be fairly, reasonably and validly interpreted to require that an employee who was a member of the Union at the time the strike began is required to observe the existing Union obligation that he had to refrain from strikebreaking for the duration of that strike, notwithstanding his resignation in the midst of the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.910" offset="415013">The second question we have, is whether the Labor Board is empowered to determine the reasonableness of the size of a Union fine imposed against a member for engaging in strikebreaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.580" offset="481677">These two questions arise in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.243" offset="500381">Boeing and Booster Lodge have a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.338" offset="524727">It expires on September 15, 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.275" offset="544475">No agreement is reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.223" offset="556283">The next day a strike begins.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.603" offset="569762">The strike lasts 18 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.798" offset="582614">On October 3, an agreement is reached, the strike ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.754" offset="610408">There were 1,900 employees in the unit that was struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.061" offset="631620">Of these 143 returned to work during the course of the strike, 24 never resigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.966" offset="679267">They retained their membership throughout the strike, but engaged in strikebreaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.717" offset="702255">119 did resign.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.356" offset="716779">Of these 119, 61 returned to work after their resignation and 58 returned to work before their resignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.461" offset="769233">All, without regard to whether they resigned or when they returned to work, were found guilty after internal union proceedings of having engaged in misconduct in violation of the Machinist constitution, which defined as misconduct of a member accepting employment in any capacity in an establishment where a strike or lockout exists as recognized under this constitution without permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.840" offset="918758">Those accused who appeared for trial apologized and pledged future loyalty to the Union, were in substance fined 50% of their strikebreaking earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.042" offset="979571">What they earned from the struck employer was the measure of their fine, one-half was the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.564" offset="1009664">Those who did not appear for trial and were found guilty, were fined a flat sum of $450.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.200" offset="1052191">This case came before the National Labor Relations Board on a complaint which alleged that the imposition of the fines which were Court collectible, the Union sought, threatened to institute court proceedings and did institute court proceedings to collect these fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.523" offset="1125439">The claim before the Board was that the imposition of the fines constituted restraint and coercion of the employees in the exercise of their right to refrain from concerted activity for mutual aid or protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.681" offset="1190118">The claim is divided into two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.077" offset="1203702">As to those employees who never resigned and as to those employees who resigned, but engaged in strikebreaking prior to the resignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.636" offset="1245915">It was said that the restraint and coercion resided in the unreasonableness of the size of the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.145" offset="1275904">It was too large and therefore it was restraint or coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.995" offset="1295339">The Board dismissed that part of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.850" offset="1310804">It said given the validity of the Union rule against strikebreaking, the size of the fine was not its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.759" offset="1342360">It was the business of a State Court on a suit to collect or set aside that fine, the State Court would decide whether or not the fine was too large.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.265" offset="1392410">As to second claim, the complaint alleged that those who engaged in post resignation strikebreaking, no fine in any amount could be levied against them and so the restraint and coercion with respect to people who were engaged in post resignation strikebreaking was that any internal Union discipline by way of a court collectible fine was of itself restraint and coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.525" offset="1513514">The Board held that it was, the Court of Appeals agreed with that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.928" offset="1539114">The Court of Appeals disagreed with the Board’s determination that it had no power to determine the reasonableness of a fine and both questions are here on the Union’s petition and the reasonableness of fine issue on the Board’s petition as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="391.390" offset="1668890">With respect to a person who did not resign, the Union can do a number of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.433" offset="1693132">It can expel him.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.964" offset="1699192">It can fine him and say that the penalty or the sanction for not paying the fine will be expulsion or it can do as it did in Allis Chalmers and was validated in Allis Chalmers, it can sue in court for the collection of the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.941" offset="1751124">With respect to a resigner, it can do virtually the same things.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.522" offset="1769409">It can say because you engaged in prior strikebreaking, you will never again be admitted to membership in this Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.020" offset="1803473">Or it can say, we will fine you and until you pay that fine, we will never again admit you to membership in this Union or it can do as it did in this case, it can sue in court to collect the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.476" offset="1861256">Now no one as I understand it contests the Union’s power to debar the fellow who engaged in strikebreaking, notwithstanding resignation, to fine him if the sanction for enforcement of the fine is saying you will pay or never be readmitted to the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.789" offset="1930533">The entire controversy centers here on the court collectibility of the fine and that it seems to us is the identical question which was before the Court in Allis Chalmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.670" offset="1974000">The sole difference being that in Allis Chalmers the worker retained his membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.801" offset="1994585">Here, he resigned in the course of the strike and our question is whether we can have a Union rule which says, if you are a member and the obligation to refrain from strikebreaking attached at the commencement of the strike, can we require as a conditional resignation, you can resign.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.537" offset="2089566">But the one obligation you cannot shed by resignation is your obligation to refrain from strikebreaking for the duration of the existing controversy.</text>

            <text syncTime="533.183" offset="2236061">At the time this can -- this strike was called it required a three-quarters vote in favor of the strike by a secret ballot and the whole notion of a secret ballot is that we shall not know who voted for or against the strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="592.452" offset="2473148">The Board holds that resignation is effective upon the Union’s receipt of the letter of resignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.510" offset="2505435">I don’t think there’s any question about the operative facts namely that as to a substantial number they’ve engaged in strikebreaking prior to resignation as to a substantial number they engaged in strikebreaking only after their resignation was effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.483" offset="2577324">Now, we have a preliminary question in this case of the interpretation of the provision in the Union constitution barring strikebreaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.504" offset="2621419">It says that a member shall refrain from strikebreaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.969" offset="2639287">It doesn’t say what happens when in the cause of a strike a member resigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.567" offset="2669589">You have two ways; one has two ways that one can interpret that prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.319" offset="2688606">It can say -- one can say that a member is barred from strikebreaking notwithstanding resignation or one can say, a member is barred from strikebreaking except following resignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.489" offset="2761331">As between those two interpretations of a Union prohibition against strikebreaking it seems to us at least fair and reasonable to say, given if the fact that it is a Union prohibition against strikebreaking, given the fact that the whole purpose of a rule against strikebreaking is to keep the man from returning to work during the course of the strike that the fair and reasonable interpretation of that rule is that it means that a member who was a member when the strike began is required to refrain from strikebreaking for the duration of that controversy.</text>

            <text syncTime="708.035" offset="2935515">I take it the Board found against you on that and the Court of Appeals found against you on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.340" offset="2960697">Is it simply your preponderance of the evidence or would you have to show that there was no substantial evidence to support that or do you treat it as a conclusion of law?</text>
            <text syncTime="723.833" offset="2998732">How do we get at it?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Bernard Dunau</label>
            <text syncTime="725.596" offset="3005733">I suppose since the Board tells us that what it is doing is interpreting a contract and the conventional formulation as I understand it is that the interpretation of a contract is supposed to be a question of law open to unrestricted judicial review that we are free here to decide whether the Union’s constitution is fairly and reasonably interpreted to bar strikebreaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.233" offset="3112312">None of us have focused on Your Honor's precise question, namely, given the Board’s interpretation what is the scope of judicial review with respect to that interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.154" offset="3155989">And I suppose that none of us have focused on it because the Board has never said that this is not a fair and reasonable interpretation of the Union prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.294" offset="3208547">What it has said is that you cannot have such an interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.230" offset="3228296">That the Union's authority over a member is limited to the time that he was a member and that ipso facto once he resigns the Union’s authority over him is at an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.826" offset="3286706">If that is correct, that is the way they read any Union constitution as I read their decision, if that is correct, one never reaches the question of how do you interpret this prohibition, no matter how reasonably and fairly it is interpreted as a matter of reading a prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.663" offset="3358072">You cannot have that interpretation because there is a superseding according to the Board rule of contract law that the authority of the Union over a member ceases on resignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.732" offset="3406346">Hence this rule even where it's explicit, as explicit as the Machinist made it in September 1972, when it amended this prohibition to state in terms, “Resignation shall not relieve a member of his obligation to refrain from accepting employment at the establishment for the duration of the strike or lockout, if the resignation occurs during the period of a strike or lockout or within 14 days preceding its commencement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="865.993" offset="3567365">That gives us -- no one any problems of interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.264" offset="3580426">It is now absolutely explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.720" offset="3590248">As I read the Board’s decision, they would say as a matter of contract law you cannot have that kind of a restriction because your authority over the member ceases with the resignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.722" offset="3646255">Therefore, there can't be no post resignation implications of continuing obligation to perform any part of the Union obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.085" offset="3683662">And it is that on which this litigation has centered as a matter of how do you read a Union constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1867.309" offset="7572564">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.207" offset="7596178">The Board is in the middle in this case in the sense that we agree with the Union that the reasonableness of the fines that were levied on members is not for the Board, but for the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.276" offset="7684472">But we agree with the company that with respect to the fines that were imposed on the resignees being violative of 8 (b) (1) (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.485" offset="7733269">Let me turn to that issue first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.079" offset="7747688">We’re now talking about the fines that were levied on employees who resigned from the Union for what done after their resignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.276" offset="7784469">We believe that Granite State which this Court decided in the December requires a conclusion that those fines violate Section 8 (b) 1 (a) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.187" offset="7828146">In Granite State, the Court held that the Unions authority to impose a court collectible fine on a member for breach of a valid Union rule is conterminous with the contract of membership between the Union and its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.924" offset="7895019">And thus when a member lawfully resigns and thereafter engages in conduct which the rule proscribes, the Union commits a violation of 8 (b) 1 (a) to levy a Court enforceable fine on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.763" offset="7958444">Finding no provision in the Union’s constitution or by laws which limited the circumstances under which a member could resign, the Court in Granite State concluded that the Union members were free to resign at will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.469" offset="8025213">And that they are right, thereafter their return to work was protected by Section 7 of the act which gives the employees including Union members not only the right to engage in Union activity, but the right to refrain from engaging in such activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.276" offset="8088430">Now, the Board found here and the court below agreed, the Union’s constitution and bylaws in the present case like those in Granite State contain no express provision limiting the circumstances under which a member could voluntarily resign from the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.053" offset="8167633">And Union business agent Higgins, confirmed this at page 111 of the appendix when he pointed out that there was no provision in the Union’s constitution whereby a man could resign by a letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.767" offset="8246418">The only way that he could resign was involuntarily in the sense that if he fell in arrears and dues, the Union could suspend them or he could get a withdrawal card as he left the industry or by death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.020" offset="8303470">But there was no provision by which he could voluntarily resign and as a matter of fact consistent with that, the Union as Higgins acknowledges in his testimony, ignored the letters of resignation when they came in, treated these employees who sought to resign just as though they continued to remain members of the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.536" offset="8409527">Now, the Union contends, however, that unlike in Granite State, here they have a constitutional provision which obligates a former member notwithstanding his resignation to refrain from abandoning a strike which was called, while he was a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.258" offset="8496358">Now, whether or not a constitutional provision which expressly prohibited a member from resigning during a strike or which expressly committed him to adhere to a strike notwithstanding a mid-strike resignation, would be valid for purposes of such a --</text>

            <text syncTime="2163.859" offset="8758836">However, let’s take a look at this constitutional provision here which is set forth at page 142 to 143 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.092" offset="8803767">It talks about improper conduct of a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.795" offset="8830516">It says the following actions or omissions constitute misconduct by a member and then you get down to accepting employment in any capacity in an establishment where a strike or lockout exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.199" offset="8884120">On its face, this provision is applicable only to a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.038" offset="8903555">It does not provide that the obligation to refrain from strikebreaking continues even after the member has resigned from the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.833" offset="8946709">Nor is there any indication that the Union ever informed its members that it interpreted this provision as being applicable even after the member resigned nor is there any indication that the employees ever thought when they joined the Union that they were bind to this kind of an obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.756" offset="9030405">As I indicated earlier, the Union simply ignored the letters of resignation because in its view you couldn't resign from this Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.945" offset="9075127">As a matter of fact, it was not until after this Court decided Granite State that the Union begin to really argue that it had a specific provision in its constitution which obligated a member to refrain from strikebreaking even after he resigns from the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.019" offset="9151404">Because if you look at the Union’s petition at page 12 in the case, the issue which the Union poses in the petition is whether a member is bound for the duration of the strike, by group decision to strike irrespective of whether he was individually opposed to that group decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.472" offset="9237295">And the distinction that they try to draw between this case and Granite State was that in Granite State, you could show that each of the employees individually voted to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.687" offset="9286092">Whereas here since there was a secret ballot strike, you couldn’t show that they -- that each one voted but nonetheless, whether he voted for it or not he was bound by the group decision to strike and what was the reason for this?</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.771" offset="9346487">The reason was because in a strike situation, it is only reasonable in view of the reliance factor that each employee who goes to strike depends upon the support of his fellow employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.695" offset="9430183">It’s only reasonable in view of these reliance considerations to imply a commitment on the part of one and all to see the strike through.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.438" offset="9473128">Now, that’s essentially, a very same sort of reliance considerations which this Court in Granite State said is not enough to constitute a waiver of the employee's Section 7 right to forgo abandoning the strike if he finds that he cannot stick it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.890" offset="9578977">Now, there are sound reasons for this Court’s Granite State view, which I submit is controlling here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.839" offset="9622758">The basic reason is that Section 7 of the Act gives employees the right to resign from the union and thereby avoid union obligations and a waiver or qualification of a statutory right must be clear and unmistakable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.651" offset="9705932">The contract between the member and the union, the union constitution, is analogous to a contract of adhesion in the sense that the member really has no choice as to the terms that are presented and therefore if he is going to be deemed to have waived his Section 7 rights, the provisions of the constitution or the bylaws must be clear and unmistakable and we submit from the terms that I have read to you that is not the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.771" offset="9874474">And thirdly, there is the consideration that this Court pointed out in Granite State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.549" offset="9901537">The events after the calling of a strike may have unsettling effects leading a member who voted to strike to change his mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.369" offset="9944900">We submit that a member should not be deemed to have given up his freedom to protect against these serious hardships unless at least there is clear evidence that he knowingly waived that right and we submit that on this record, a board -- the Court below were justified in finding that there had not been such waive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.777" offset="10038523">Now, with respect to the fines that were levied on the members who either did not resign from the union or that portion of the fines that it is electable to the pre-resignation work activity of those who did resign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.222" offset="10176240">We submit that those fines are not violative of Section 8 (b) (1) (A) and the authority of this Court’s decision in Allis-Chalmers to be sure the fines in Allis-Chalmers were conceded to be reasonable in amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.277" offset="10292433">So therefore, this Court did not specifically pass upon the reasonableness point that we have presented in this case, but we submit that the logic and reasoning of the Court’s decision in Allis-Chalmers supports the Board’s conclusion that the reasonableness of the amount of the fine is not a matter of the Board, but for the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.811" offset="10462647">It does not go to the question as to whether or not the fines which apart from reasonableness would not violate 8 (b) (1) (A) are brought within the ban of 8 (b) (1) (A).</text>

            <text syncTime="3319.835" offset="13382719">They were imposed for working while the employees were members of the union so you don’t have the Granite State problem, that you have on the first part of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.503" offset="13425351">They were not sought to be enforced by unacceptable means, namely, violence or affecting the man’s job rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.949" offset="13467146">The only means used was a court suit, a means which the court in Allis-Chalmers and in Scofield recognized was a legitimate means in which we submit or provide the member a full opportunity to contest the reasonableness of the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.698" offset="13550216">Now, to require the Board to determine whether the amount of the fines is reasonable would bring it inevitably, deeply into the area of internal union affairs much more deeply and Congress entered it with Landrum-Griffin because in Landrum-Griffin in 1959, enacted a provision that said that you can fine and suspend and expel a member and enacted only procedural safeguards that limit the use of that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.884" offset="13706951">Now, the court below here at 29 (a) of the appendix directed the Board to take into account such factors as a compensation received by the strikebreakers, the level of strike benefits made available to the striking employees, the individual needs of the persons being disciplined, the detrimental effects of the strikebreaking upon the effectiveness of the strike effort, the length of time of the work stoppage, the strength of the particular union involved, the availability of other less harsh union remedies and other similar considerations.</text>

            <text syncTime="4298.933" offset="17299101">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4306.646" offset="17329925">The individual employee who is not specifically represented by counsel here, would ask whether the words refrain from concerted activity in a strike situation should be so narrowly construed as to put him completely at the mercy of the power struggle between the employer and the union, which may last for 18 months or more as frequently as it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="4355.286" offset="17524485">It seems to me that in the realistic world of this individual employee and his union, which is often as powerful or more powerful than his employer, unless the statutory language refrained from concerted activity gives him some freedom of reign, then when he and some of his fellow employees make an attempt to bring the strike to an end, that is, when they engage in concerted activity to refrain from continued participation in the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="4421.787" offset="17790516">And a fine is levied of $1,000, $2,000, $5,000 and these are commonplace and not only not unusual that commonplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="4437.600" offset="17853733">After the admonition, if you try a back-to-work movement, we’ll get you.</text>
            <text syncTime="4453.470" offset="17917262">He and his fellow employees in that movement are fined $1,000, $2,000 or $5,000 for that concerted activity that is a violation of the Act in the very plainest terms.</text>

            <text syncTime="4483.860" offset="18038784">There is none in this record here sir, but the jurisdiction attaches with the allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4491.668" offset="18070026">Once it is alleged that the fines were levied for this concerted activity of returning to work of opposing the union, of strikebreaking, then it is the Labor Board’s ballgame.</text>
            <text syncTime="4507.903" offset="18135019">It’s a Labor Board’s province and it may not be disturbed by any other tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4523.026" offset="18195519">Now, the Board may find that there is no violation of 8 (b) 1 (A) because of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4530.877" offset="18226866">It may find that the fines were uniformly imposed, that they were regularly handled, that due process was accorded to all the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.137" offset="18271901">All of the criteria which it may establish and which may stand the test of time and which maybe uniform for all fines and there it is a in a peculiar position to establish uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4556.280" offset="18328534">The Board may dismiss the 8 (b) 1 (A) charge as it has dismissed thousands of 8 (a) (1) and 8 (a) (3) charges, but it hears the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4569.748" offset="18382346">It considers the case when the allegation is made and that is the thing of paramount importance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4579.443" offset="18421112">Until the Board hears the evidence once a charge of 8 (b) 1 (A) has been filed, it cannot tell whether it is a violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4594.728" offset="18482239">It cannot tell whether the fine is a excessive for the concerted activity that is the crux of the matter which I believe has to be decided by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4615.069" offset="18563636">My reading of Allis-Chalmers and the problems it presented to the Court which was somewhat divided in its analysis of the legislative history of 8 (b) (1) (A) leads me to believe that were it not for a special factor in that situation and which is here present also, the case would’ve been decided differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="4660.357" offset="18744822">That special factor is quite relevant to the decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4671.877" offset="18790902">In weighing the balances -- in balancing the interests between the employees as a whole and the individual employees, both having interest and rights under the Act, the Court decided that the erosive effect of permitting members to escape penalty, whole sale, any time they desired to go back to work would operate against the purposes of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4726.426" offset="19009076">That one single thought pervades the majority opinion in Allis-Chalmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4733.627" offset="19037915">Were it not for that, I believe that the plain language which gives the employee the right to refrain as well as to engage in concerted activity, would have been interpreted to allow him to refrain at anytime.</text>
            <text syncTime="4761.995" offset="19151391">But I believe Allis-Chalmers should be limited to that interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4767.488" offset="19173334">It should be limited to that narrow rule and it should be limited to the period of membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="4778.016" offset="19215444">Otherwise, Unions would be able to subvert the plain meaning of the statute by writing 8 (b) 1 (A) virtually out of it insofar as strikebreaking situations are concerned, despite whatever hardship may come to an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4801.527" offset="19309484">In fact, the language by which the Union in this case sought to repel its constitution by a subsequent amendment would freeze the employee forever since he couldn’t effectively resign and I don’t care what words are used; whether it is resignation or obedience to a rule which carries the same effect as continued membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.051" offset="19479594">But the amendment to this constitution would not allow this employee to go back to work without severe penalties, penalties which might destroy his opportunities for employment because he might be discharged for garnishment or he might lose his home, he might lose all his possessions, he might be replaced in the meantime and lose his job entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="4870.866" offset="19586800">This amendment would prohibit him during the period of the controversy for foreseeable period prior to the strike from going back to work and then when the controversy ended if it were a Union shop contract he would be frozen again to the duration of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4893.001" offset="19675408">And I don’t read the statute or the practicalities of Labor Relations the way that my brother representing the Union does.</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.336" offset="19736743">I read Section 8 (a) to provide that an employer may without violating the statute, enter into a contract which requires Union membership for the duration of that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4931.941" offset="19831097">That is the language of Section 8 that provides all section 8 (a) 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="4937.008" offset="19851368">And while we don’t have it in this particular case, in this case we have a very unusual type of provision from my long experience in Labor Relations, which instead of requiring the employee to join within 30 days as is usually the case is, allows him not to join and to remain free of Union membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="4961.864" offset="19950843">But except in right to work states the contracts are legion, almost universal, requiring membership with all of the concomitant of membership and all of the requirements of membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="4987.592" offset="20053765">I can’t conceive of any freedom of action on the part of an individual who frequently, much less frequently than we redefine print of insurance policies is totally ignorant of what is going on between his employer and his employee and matters of this kind and his Union and matters to this kind and it’s totally ignorant of the fine print of Union constitutions which often contained a hundred and more pages of fine print.</text>
            <text syncTime="5024.937" offset="20203081">In fact, it is notorious that Unions have an extremely difficult time obtaining attendance at meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5034.019" offset="20239444">I can’t conceive of the individual caught up in this world having any freedom at all under the statute, any freedom under the statute, in strike breaking situations which are the most crucial to him unless he has the right to get out from under when the going gets tough.</text>
            <text syncTime="5062.471" offset="20353233">And I cannot conceive of a rational rule which allows the Union by hocus-pocus and fancy language that keep this employee under it's thumb no matter how meritorious, no matter how much credence we should give to the terms solidarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5089.707" offset="20462216">There must be is 8 (b) 1 (A) means anything at all, if the statute means anything at all and Taft-Hartley was adopted in 1947 primarily for the benefit of the individual, I can’t conceive of he is not being allowed to get out anytime after a contract expires just as he has the right anytime a contract expires to go to the Board and file a petition for this certification to get rid of the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="5128.316" offset="20616652">So far as interference for the internal affairs of Union is concerned, the Union complaints on the one hand that the Board shouldn’t do it and on the other hand ask that the courts to be allowed to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5147.439" offset="20693138">That poses the question since we all agree that somebody should do it to the extent of protecting this individual and poses a question who is the best qualified to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5164.513" offset="20761475">And if the Labor Board, with all of its expertise in thousands of strike situations, has any business in this field at all, that is if it has any authority to entertain the question of whether or not an employee maybe fined then it has the business to decide all of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5198.440" offset="20897102">In case after case, the Board does not get only those cases, only those situations where employees have not resigned, and therefore, can follow Allis-Chalmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5220.214" offset="20984247">In case after case, there will be employees who have resigned and employees who have not resigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5229.839" offset="21022699">Moreover, as to those who have resigned there will be problems requiring interpretation of the language even to this amendment in this case as to what it means so that the Board cannot escape dealing with the problem of fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="5253.166" offset="21116008">The question is, is it going to deal with that problem piecemeal, is it going to handle just this little bit and say the rest belongs to the courts or is it going to be required to do what I think is his duty to handle the whole ball of wax and dispose of the all ball of wax one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="5276.175" offset="21208064">That seems to be the rational of this Court running from Garner against Teamsters, through Garmon against San Diego and all the other preemption cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5288.764" offset="21258428">I don’t say that this is a case of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="5291.681" offset="21270131">I say, it as a practical matter tied to a clear legal right that all of this belongs to the Board including the decision as to whether or not fines are reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="5642.864" offset="22674787">I know one fact which we ascertain because we wanted to know in view of the Court of Appeals' determination that not only was the Board in this business, but that you could not have a rule which eliminate -- you could not have them at exhaustion, or you could not require the member to exhaust this Internal Union remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5663.412" offset="22757021">We wanted therefore to find out how many times in the course of a two-year period we have had Internal Union Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5671.267" offset="22788472">We found out that we had have 42 Internal Union Appeals of which 15 pertained to strikebreaking or picketing activity and that with respect to those Internal Union Appeals, we reversed about half of what the local laws did.</text>
            <text syncTime="5687.304" offset="22852629">So that if the Board is in this business, it’s either going to have to decide, you don’t have to exhaust your Internal Union remedy, in which case you throw away the whole body of all which we have always taken for granted or it decides you had no excuse for not exhausting your remedy or you had an excuse for exhausting your remedy in which case you’re completely within the -- into species of Internal Union Affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5714.819" offset="22962657">In other words, there is no way of considering an issue of the reasonableness of a Union fine without getting into the Internal business of the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="5725.304" offset="23004557">Well, if that’s what section 8 (b) 1 (A) requires, fine, that’s what it requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="5729.827" offset="23022634">So we’re required really to confront the question, is it a violation of Section 8 (b) 1 (A) to impose an unreasonably large fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="5740.041" offset="23063489">Now, there are only two places in this statute that one can look to for an answer to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5745.837" offset="23086686">One, the words restrain and coerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5748.907" offset="23099016">Are you restraining and coercing by imposing an unreasonable fine?</text>
            <text syncTime="5755.302" offset="23124616">Well, we know you are not restraining and coercing when you impose a reasonable fine because that’s what Allis-Chalmers was all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="5763.324" offset="23156694">But what does a reasonable fine do?</text>
            <text syncTime="5766.518" offset="23169442">The whole purpose of the reasonable fine is to compel a total restraint from strikebreaking during the cause of a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="5775.065" offset="23203610">There is no point to a fine which does not completely restrains strikebreaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="5780.940" offset="23227120">So, the restraint exist by virtue of a reasonable fine, you don’t add anymore restraint by making the fine unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5789.910" offset="23262960">What you do when you say the fine is unreasonably large, is not that it restraints or coerces any fine restraints or coerces and there is not point to what if it doesn’t restraint or coerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5801.563" offset="23309667">What you say when a fine is unreasonable, if you tell a man it’s $2000, you’re going to pay because you engaged in strikebreaking and a state court has pointed out that this man has got take home pay of $50 and 10 children, no state court is going to enforce that fine because no state court is going to allow the collection of a $2000 fine against a man who has $40 and take home pay or a $100 and 10 children.</text>
            <text syncTime="5827.964" offset="23415202">But that has nothing to do with the fact that you are enforcing a rule against strikebreaking.</text>

            <text syncTime="5891.423" offset="23669112">Exactly, Your Honor and the whole purpose aside from saying, you can’t have any restraint or coercion out of an unreasonable fine that you don’t have out of reasonable fine because the whole purpose of a reasonable fine is to say, you will not engage in strikebreaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="5906.336" offset="23728671">You don’t add restraint and coercion by an unreasonable fine, you go to the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="5911.621" offset="23749883">The proviso deliberately says, you will not impair the right of a labor organization to prescribe its own rules with respect to the acquisition or retention of membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="5923.014" offset="23795440">Now, what does it mean to say, you will be able to prescribe your own rules?</text>
            <text syncTime="5928.418" offset="23817070">It means that if you have a rule and it’s violated, you can impose internal union discipline to enforce it and that part of the game is no part of the Board’s business.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="5939.830" offset="23862732">Do you think then it’s better -- it’s more cohesive and consistent with the whole history of the Labor Act to have the courts of 50 different states doing this instead of one policy by the Board itself?</text>

            <label>Mr. Bernard Dunau</label>
            <text syncTime="5957.962" offset="23935248">Let me answer that question Your Honor by telling the Court precisely what happened in David O'Reilly which is the case in which the Board said, it had no power and that has no power because it’s not a violation of Section 8 (b) 1 (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="5970.844" offset="23986761">There were violations of Section 8 (b) 1 (A) all the power in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="5975.533" offset="24005465">In the David O’ Reilly, the man engaged in strikebreaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="5979.497" offset="24021347">He was a member and he remained a member so we have no resignation issue in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5984.315" offset="24040678">He was fined $500 for engaging in strikebreaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="5987.847" offset="24054784">The fine of $500 was equivalent to his take home pay from a strikebreaking earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5992.817" offset="24074637">So the fine said, you are engaged in strikebreaking violation of the rule, your penalty is give up your strikebreaking earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="6001.584" offset="24109746">That case was taken by the Union -- the local Union there into a California Court to seek a judgment to recover the $500 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="6012.313" offset="24152586">In that Court, the issue presented by the employee the fine is unfair and unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6021.213" offset="24188217">There were two proceedings in Nisi Prius Court in California and two appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="6026.724" offset="24210265">We finally got a judgment which said, the fine for $500 is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6032.824" offset="24234715">The judgment became final and un-appealable and it was paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="6038.236" offset="24256345">That is the situation in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6041.111" offset="24267839">It had a state suit to collect, it had a defense the fine was unreasonable, it rejected defense the judgment was entered and the judgment was satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="6049.362" offset="24300857">What does the Labor Board do now with that situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="6052.949" offset="24315173">The Ninth Circuit says, go back and determine reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="6056.315" offset="24328652">There are only three alternatives; one, the state court had no power to consider the issue of reasonableness because that is preempted to the Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="6067.186" offset="24372120">If that’s what you have, you have a totally impossible situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6072.146" offset="24391973">If the question is before the Board, it cannot render judgments in favor of the Union for the collection of the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="6077.924" offset="24415065">You want to collect the fine, you have to go to a state court and you tell you’re sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="6081.691" offset="24430111">The state court has no power to determine an issue critical essential to your recovery of the fine. Conceivably then what you could have is that first, you got to determination out of the Board that the fine is reasonable that will take you five years and then you’ll institute a suit in the state court to recover and then you’ll have additional defenses in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6101.475" offset="24509315">That makes no sense as a matter of dealing with the specific subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="6105.964" offset="24527182">There is an alternative, you can have concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6109.999" offset="24543378">The Board can decide it, the state court can decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6113.732" offset="24558320">Fine, if you have concurrent jurisdiction, ordinarily it ends by the proceeding, the proceeding which ends sooner and the determinative disposition by collateral estoppel or res judicata, that’s it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6127.009" offset="24611401">If that’s what we have, then in the California case the Board has no business in it anymore because there has been a final, un-appealable, collective judgment, it’s res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="6136.721" offset="24650271">So, whether the Board decides the issue or the Court will depend on the happenstance, the other happenstance of who’s proceeding ends first or you can have it as we think we should have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6147.672" offset="24694053">It’s a state court matter, it was decided by the state court in David O’ Reilly that’s where it begins, that’s where it ends, that’s the way we have been administering Union discipline in this country since we had Unions and Union discipline.</text>
