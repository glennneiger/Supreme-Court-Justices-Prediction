            <text syncTime="13.276" offset="156505">Former governor and senator, Daniel asked me to express to you his regrets that he could not appear and argue this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.084" offset="179702">He has been appointed to the Supreme Court of Texas and our Canons of judicial ethics prevent him from appearing in that, but he did handled the case before the Special Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.470" offset="217213">The maps which are behind me, one you have an individual map which I have had furnished to the Court, the large map is furnished by Mr. Stockwell, the counsel of Louisiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="52.540" offset="313553">I have all the colored copies that the geological survey offers here in Washington had of the map, the others are reproductions made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.521" offset="353468">I will refer to that map some in the later part of my argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="86.098" offset="447718">So, I asked the Court to please ask any questions that you may have, concerning any arguments that Mr. Stockwell has raised in his brief in order that I may have the opportunity to respond to them and I also, unless the Court have some question about it, we will pass over the question of the jurisdiction of course and also the question of whether or not the United States is a necessary party.</text>

            <text syncTime="262.047" offset="1151561">Texas claims by grant from the United States made by act of Congress on July the 5th 1848 and also claims title by prescription and equity assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.633" offset="1197955">Now, it should be pointed out here I think, because this does bear on the point of whether or not the United States should conceivably be a party in this lawsuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.438" offset="1281128">Louisiana claims by theory of agency or osmosis or something to have had prior title in 1848 as a result of the treaty of 1819 with Spain, settling the territory of boundaries of the United States and Spain.</text>

            <text syncTime="318.565" offset="1377677">To Texas, the basic question in the lawsuit is as between the United States and Louisiana on July 5th 1848 who had title to the western half of the Sabine River including Sabine Lake and Sabine Pass.</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel D. McDaniel</label>
            <text syncTime="349.435" offset="1501080">That's correct, we contend that Congress never granted the area in dispute to Louisiana and the Louisiana steering of the case in addition to be being wrong because the instruments just don’t grant it to Louisiana, is constitutionally wrong because Article 4 Section 3 gives the Congress the exclusive power to dispose as the territory of the United States and the first senate to the constitution defines the Congress is consisting of the senate and a house of representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.318" offset="1620616">And the treaty which acquired property for the United States is an executive action right across by the senate and it cannot dispose the property to one of the states of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.623" offset="1665860">The history of the thing starts with the 1803 purchase of Louisiana at a time, when the Westward claim of the Louisiana Purchase was completely unsettled.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.431" offset="1729076">Jefferson and many other prominent people thought that the claim extended clear to the Rio Grande.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.703" offset="1758229">In 1811, the Congress authorized the formation of the state of Louisiana from the Orleans territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.485" offset="1801279">Part of the language, the part of the description relative to the case is in the Special Master's report on page 41.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.856" offset="1838791">What I’m reading is from the statutes at large, which has a little more in it than the Master quoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.463" offset="1869197">It reads that the inhabitants of all that part of the territory, are country ceded under the name of Louisiana and then it talks about the session from France.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.558" offset="1909635">Contained within the following limits, that is to say beginning at the mouth of the river Sabine, thence by land to be drawn along the middle of said river, including all islands to the 32nd degree of latitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.870" offset="1978807">The Louisiana constitution of 1812 is in virtually identical language except that it inserts the word if between all and islands and the 1812 act of admission by the Congress, it I believe in precisely the same language, the if is not in yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.271" offset="2060413">Now, the 1812 act admitting Louisiana as a state is also pertinent it seems to us in another regard because Section 3 of that Act reads this way, that the sub-state, speaking of Louisiana, together with the residue of that portion of country which was comprehended within the territory of Orleans, as constituted by the Act entitling an act directing Louisiana into two territories and providing contemporary governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.593" offset="2209729">There shall be one district and be called the Louisiana District and that should the established in the said district, a District Court who consist of one judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.772" offset="2250480">And in the 1850 publication of the statute at large which is the ones, we have down in Texas, there is one of these little marginal squabs here that says, the inhabitance of Louisiana within directed limits, to be authorized to form a constitution and state.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.042" offset="2331564">We contend that the Congress of course knew exactly what they were doing and were acting within what was the normal procedure of directing state boundary in the middle of the stream, when they defined Louisiana's eastern boundary up to the 32nd degree of the latitude here as being in the middle of the Sabine River.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.303" offset="2428635">It becomes a lawsuit on a controversy because of the 1819 treaty with Spain.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.427" offset="2473044">When that treaty was executed after a considerable period of negotiation, the treaty called for the boundary between the two countries to be the western bank of the Sabine, starting at the westward mouth of the Sabine and then up to the western bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.019" offset="2543470">This treaty was ratified by Mexico in 1828 by the Republic of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.359" offset="2572831">In 1838, the boundary was actually surveyed in 1840-41 by the joint commission of the Republic of Texas and the United States and was marked on the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.688" offset="2626121">And that was the extent of Texas' historic claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.354" offset="2644825">In 1845 of course, we had the annexation of Texas into the Union or its President Polk referred to it in his inaugural address, the reannexation of Texas into the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.924" offset="2699055">Now, we don't think that there's anything at all out of the ordinary about the fact that the people who were leaders in this country in the other part of the last century, fully expected that there will be more states organized to the westward of Louisiana, certainly President Jackson and others never ceased their efforts, to get Texas and ultimately they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.187" offset="2788080">The next act of significance in this controversy is important enough, that if the court will indulge me, I will read it to you, it's on page 42 of the Special Master’s report, it's a resolution not by some pretty functionary of the government of Louisiana, but a solemn declaration of the Louisiana legislature passed in 1848.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.808" offset="2886614">It reads as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.865" offset="2894869">“Whereas the constitution and the laws in the state of Louisiana nor those of any other state or territory extend over the waters of the Sabine River in the middle of said stream to the western bank thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.504" offset="2949413">And it is of importance to the citizens living contiguous thereto and to the people in general that the jurisdiction of some state should be extended over said territory in order that crimes and offenses committed thereon should be punished and wrongs and damages inflicted should be redressed in a speedy and convenient manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.068" offset="3019630">Therefore, be it resolved by the senate house of representatives of the State of Louisiana in General Assembly convened, first that the constitution and the jurisdiction of the State of Louisiana shall be extended over part of the United States embraced in the following limits (Whenever the consent of the Congress of the United States can be procured there too), there is between the middle of the Sabine River and the western bank to begin at the mouth of said river, where it enters into the Gulf of Mexico and thence to continue along to the said western bank to the place where it intersects the 32nd degree of North Latitude, it being the boundary line between the said State of Louisiana and the State of Texas.”</text>
            <text syncTime="770.834" offset="3186709">Counsel of Louisiana argued that this is an assertion of Louisiana’s boundary to the west bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.045" offset="3211577">We argue the exact contrary that it is an admission by the Louisiana legislature that they did not own the west bank and petitioned to Congress to allow and to extend their boundaries, two only.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.495" offset="3257344">Texas passed a similar resolution in the same month of 1848 and sent it to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.469" offset="3289213">Congress denied Louisiana’s petition and granted Texas' petition and on July 05, 1848, passed the Act consenting to Texas to extend her boundary over the eastern half of the Sabine River.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.882" offset="3346892">I would like to read out particular language because it is relevant to an argument that I make a little further on.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.204" offset="3372178">“Be it enacted and so forth that the Congress consent to the legislature of the State of Texas to extend her eastern boundaries, so as to include within her limits one-half of Sabine Pass, one-half of Sabine Lake and also one-half of the Sabine river from its mouth as far north is a 32nd degree of north latitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.840" offset="3462771">Now, the Congress apparently realized full well, that Louisiana did not own this area and that the United States did because on page 43 of the master’s report is quoted the report of the Senate Committee own this bill and then the last paragraph appearing on the page says, Mr. Butler asked for the immediate consideration of the bill and briefly explained it's character.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.349" offset="3572799">The boundary of the United States it was known embraced the Sabine River and Lake to its western shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.697" offset="3598190">The boundary of the State of Louisiana extended to the middle of the Sabine.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.633" offset="3613863">So that the half of the river and lake to the western shore belonged to the United States and was not included in the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.177" offset="3644061">Therefore, the boundary of the state and that of the United States was not identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.331" offset="3664645">The bill before the Senate gives the half of the river beyond the boundary of the State of Louisiana to the State of Texas for the purpose of enabling the later to extend her criminal jurisdiction to the Louisiana boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.328" offset="3712711">Louisiana has also argued that all the bill does is allow Texas to extend its criminal jurisdiction, but of course it does more, it allows them to extend their boundary, that is the way they are allowing them to extend their criminal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.721" offset="3770284">And then it concludes Mr. Johnson of Louisiana and Mr. Downs on behalf of the state of Louisiana expressed the acquiescence in the arrangement, which of course were their two senators at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.897" offset="3818977">Contrary to the statement in the master’s report on page 9 which I think is in inadvertence, the statement of the second question is the doctrine of acquiescence in prescription applied to the plans of either state and if so, what is his application to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.536" offset="3897553">Louisiana has never pled nor claimed title by acquiescence in prescription in this lawsuit and we contend that on the law, Texas is entitled to judgment confirming her title in the western half of the Sabine River.</text>

            <text syncTime="1560.397" offset="6344913">Also in 1938 we have an opinion issued by the Louisiana Attorney General’s office, advising a man in Monroe, Louisiana is to Igoe, I believe it is, this is at Page 69 and 70 of special master’s report, that the Louisiana boundary was set by act of Congress of April 6, 1812, that is the act of admission to find him in the middle of the road and the Texas boundary by act of Congress of July 5, 1848.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.525" offset="6457448">The man had written in and apparently he had gotten a lease which purported to give him all of the river bottom and he wanted to know whether he got all or half and the Louisiana Attorney General said he got only half.</text>

            <text syncTime="1625.300" offset="6604570">I would point out to this that all three of those attempts were before the Act of Congress of July 12, 1848 and from the date of the act of Congress on July 12, 1848 until the inception of the controversy with the beginning of oil and gas activity in the area about 1940-41, there was a no question of title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.944" offset="6703104">The special master refers to the desirability of having settled these cases years ago and quotes of the first Justice Harlan's comment to that effect in United States versus Texas in 1895-96, the simple truth is that 100 years ago there was certainly no controversy about this plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.481" offset="6801324">Louisiana also argues that Thalweg should be applied, we say that it is not applicable in this case for four reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.245" offset="6828387">Number one, there is no reason for it where navigational rights are not at issue and we cite Georgia versus South Carolina for that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.724" offset="6862242">Secondly, we say that the prescription and acquiescence establish a line to the geographic center of the Sabine River and that prescription and acquiescence would overcome the Thalweg doctrine in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.606" offset="6913755">Thirdly, and this is not mentioned by the master, there is considerable evidence in the record that there is no Thalweg in Sabine lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.804" offset="6946565">The map show a reasonable uniform depth throughout the lake, there is even one in the record made in 1777 that has uniform soundings throughout the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.298" offset="6984600">And fourthly, and the master emphasized this, the act of Congress of July 5th, 1848 indicated that it was the view of Congress that Texas was together at one half, one half, one half not merely to the middle of the river.</text>

            <text syncTime="2081.981" offset="8431261">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.025" offset="8447457">I think that it is very important from Louisiana's standpoint to have the Court appreciate the early history of this particular area as Mr. McDaniel has mentioned when Louisiana was purchased from France in 1803 there was a dispute over what its western boundary was going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.018" offset="8539408">So, in 1804 they created the territory of Orleans which extended to the 33rd degree north latitude which is the north boundary of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.853" offset="8578800">So, in 1806 and I think this is very important, neither of the special masters of Texas have really covered this issue, in 1806, the United States and Spain, entered into an agreement creating what was known as a neutral zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.726" offset="8650271">Now, this neutral zone extended from the Mermentau River up to the Red river.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.434" offset="8677125">Now the Red River is part of the Mississippi watershed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.463" offset="8697187">The big issue was Louisiana was only to cover the Louisiana watershed and the Louisiana watershed fell somewhere between Lake Chapala and the Mermentau.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.071" offset="8747656">So, Spain had brought troops into this area and the United States had brought troops in there and they were getting ready to have a confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.939" offset="8783078">So they entered into this agreement in 1806 and provided that neither the United States nor Spain would occupy this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.047" offset="8827591">They would assert no jurisdiction over it and it really became a no man’s land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.613" offset="8849847">And when Louisiana was admitted as a State in 1812 it was admitted subject to this outstanding agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.314" offset="8884642">Louisiana could not take possession of this area of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.880" offset="8898853">They could not go in there and could force any laws at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.897" offset="8918915">And of course this wasn't settled until the Trivia of 1890.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.819" offset="8942634">In other words Spain and the United States negotiated a treaty and settled the western boundary of the Louisiana purchase and also the Florida parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.205" offset="8988191">Of course the boundary one could find this to Louisiana, it went on up to the Red River and out to the Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.564" offset="9017657">But when they settled that boundary they settled it on the west bank of the Sabine up to the 32nd degree north latitude and then north to the 33rd which is the north west corner of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.164" offset="9080038">So, no patent were issued at this area by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.171" offset="9100100">When Louisiana was admitted as a State the Federal government retained all un-appropriated lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.280" offset="9124446">Now Texas when it was admitted as a state retained these lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.617" offset="9141791">So, all of the titles to Louisiana lands emanate from the Federal government except now in the streams.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.512" offset="9169377">So during this period there were no titles issued in here at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2276.198" offset="9208142">It's liberty of putting a chapter out of this book of Maroo (ph) who was a freebooter in this particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.846" offset="9234787">As a matter of fact I live in Lake Charles which is in this particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.731" offset="9250252">It is about 70 miles from the Sabine across to the Mermentau.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.410" offset="9269060">So, you can see that it was quite a question when Louisiana was admitted into the Union up till they settled this dispute in 1890 and finally they did not issue patents till about 1824.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.124" offset="9327888">They started issuing some patents and even when they surveyed this line in 1840-41, Mr. Overton who was representing the United States pointed out the law in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.119" offset="9379819">And so even when Texas was admitted as a state in 1845 they still had this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.557" offset="9421615">Now Texas did have a settlements along the Sabine on the West bank but Louisiana have no settlements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.615" offset="9449827">All this was marsh land and it is marsh to date and way up to river its marsh.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.069" offset="9471666">The only settlement was along the western bank and I think that's important because as the Court will note in my Appendix I mentioned a letter from Secretary of State of the Republic of Texas to the representative of United States concerning an interpretation of the word use in the treaty of 1890.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.807" offset="9566647">Now, both the special master and Texas have avoided a discussion of this particular phrase which I think is the main issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.613" offset="9601860">Now the representative of the Republic of Texas said the word use meant to the jurisdiction over this water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.022" offset="9639476">You see in the treaty both the inhabitants of Texas and the inhabitants of Louisiana had equal use and navigation of the water which gave them a use throughout the whole river and this use would not limit it to navigation, that was something separate and Texas in this letter which is in the appendix defines what they consider this used to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.980" offset="9739264">They had ports here and ships were coming in and smuggling and they wanted to have the right to go out and exercise jurisdiction to stop the smuggling which they said they had a right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.843" offset="9790777">Now this discussion was going on, this was just prior to 1845 when Texas was admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.424" offset="9821080">So it wasn’t unusual for Louisiana in 1848 to say that there was some question as to whether or not they had full jurisdiction over the Sabine even though they own -- their boundary was on the west bank because the constitution said commencing at the mouth of the Sabine bends along the middle to the 33rd degree north latitude and in north to the 33rd.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.483" offset="9937272">So, in this resolution as it is read by Mr. McDaniel accurately, they said that they were talking about extending jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.753" offset="9978337">Here were both Louisiana and Texas that had equal jurisdiction over this body of water by virtue of the use and so it was a question of either Louisiana having a full jurisdiction or like Congress decided to do, they gave half of the jurisdiction to Texas so that they could enforce the criminal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.532" offset="10073527">Now even Texas, I think it is really important because Texas talks about the fact that Louisiana being able to acquire this territory without a specific act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.938" offset="10123160">In one of Texas briefs, it is a brief, plaintiffs reply brief before the Special Master on page six, they admit that -- in other words, they say Louisiana obtained title to the unsold federal land adjacent to the Texas-Houston land boundary line by grants from the United States Government under the Swamp and Overflow Lands Act after its jurisdiction over the area had been recognized and acquiesced in by the United States Government’s resurvey of such land as a waste land in 1846.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.065" offset="10279581">Now what happened was that before Texas was admitted into the union and before they made this joint survey, the United States had gone in and surveyed a lot of this land and they had surveyed as part of the land that they considered Louisiana that extended west of this line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.431" offset="10377070">So when they made this survey in 1841, they had to readjust these townships and some of the people that had purchased land from the United States Government in Louisiana received a indemnity for it and so they -- that meant that Louisiana had to give up some land out of this area and the lines were readjusted as Texas admits in 1846 to conform to this boundary agreement in 1890.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.516" offset="10505488">Now, Texas, in bringing this suit, they limited it to this water boundary, but Louisiana feel that they only way the Court can appreciate this boundary dispute is that it must consider the total boundary of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.227" offset="10572257">Texas knew that Louisiana’s boundaries from the 33rd to 32nd degree north latitude would have to be recognized as the treaty boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.856" offset="10614784">Now they are saying that we are not entitled to the treaty boundary from the 32nd degree to the Gulf of Mexico by virtue of the language in the Constitution of 1812 of Louisiana which is the same constitution which covered the northern boundary in which they admit we are entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.169" offset="10684061">So we say that when the Court considered this case in the light of the historical facts that this Act, if they would allow this resolution, show that Louisiana considered that this was their west boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.001" offset="10747382">They are only asking to give them the jurisdiction and the Congress gave the jurisdiction to Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.817" offset="10782595">Now, if it is intended by this Act that they transfer this title to Texas, then under this Court’s case of Mississippi versus Louisiana, Congress could not deprive Louisiana of title to its land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.219" offset="10844244">So, we say that that's one of the reasons why you find all of these maps and things with this line now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.991" offset="10883323">In other words, there have been no question about the question of jurisdiction of fishing, hunting and various other activities on these navigable bodies of water because the citizens of both states had equal rights unless you considered that the jurisdiction was going to be exercised in limited areas by either one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.338" offset="10968691">Now, this particular body of water here is not -- as a recent -- as a matter of fact, this was brought about by compact between Texas and Louisiana in 1954, creating the Toledo Bend Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.755" offset="11030444">In this compact, it was specifically stated that this would not attempt to settle a boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.787" offset="11054477">In other words, Texas knows that there has been a real dispute over this boundary for many years and they have not been misled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.231" offset="11084257">As a matter of fact, Governor Jones in 1941 wrote a letter to the Governor of Texas stating that Louisiana owned to the west bank of the Sabine under the treaty of 1890.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.816" offset="11138591">As a matter of fact, Mr. Gouge, who was then Land Commission of Texas, he claimed that Texas owned 150 foot strip from this point on the Sabine, 32nd to the 33rd.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.708" offset="11198255">In other words, at that time, they were trying to claim that they owned over to Louisiana’s boundary under what they said the wording of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.438" offset="11233155">Now they admit that Louisiana owns it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.548" offset="11245589">So it all goes to show that Texas really has never had any claim, had any doubt that Louisiana has its plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.640" offset="11277981">Now they thought that they would bring in a picture like this that shows the, all this field here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.744" offset="11306297">Well actually all this field was done by the Corps of Engineers in digging these channels and this was not done by Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.872" offset="11338898">The fact that Texas has used some of them and of course the United States has a navigational easement over this whole body of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.202" offset="11372231">So we say that Louisiana by virtue of the fact that it—</text>

            <text syncTime="3222.183" offset="12992136">In the case of Fergosa (ph), they had a treaty in 1905 in which they settled some Bancos as they call it which is made by the Rio Grande River.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.780" offset="13042500">Now part of these Bancos were taken from Mexico and given to United States in part to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.321" offset="13076668">Now the question came up in this case as whether or not a party acquired a title to one of these Bancos by limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.724" offset="13110314">And the only way he could acquire that title was if Texas got title to this Banco by virtue of the treaty and not by virtue of some acts that was passed in 1823 -- 1923 and the Court held that when the United States and Mexico settle this boundary, that those lands merely became part of Texas and it didn’t need any further action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.524" offset="13221491">They said Texas had given up some land and they acquired some land and that is the same thing as Louisiana has done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.787" offset="13250539">The question (Inaudible) we say that (Inaudible) Louisiana is in this position, this is an alternative plea, if the Court feel that we are not entitled to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.084" offset="13291708">This Court is held into the case of the State of Louisiana versus Mississippi that the Thalweg applied to the east boundary of Louisiana in the Pearl River and extending all down into the gulf interpreting the same language and the constitution that is involved in this case, the middle of the Sabine, the middle of the Pearl and the question they both have arrived at navigation and of course we feel that certainly, this Court, in making other cases dealing with navigable streams where you have equal rights of navigation have always held that the Thalweg applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.201" offset="13436217">Now the case of Georgia versus North Carolina is kind of an unusual case and we do not believe that that was more or less, the parties more or less admitted themselves in that kind of a position but we feel that the majority of the jurisprudence in particular interpret their own constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.641" offset="13509987">This Court has held but the Thalweg rule would apply if you feel that we are not entitled to the west bank boundary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3378.445" offset="13617194">As a matter of fact, you can see they have done a lot of channel work in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.258" offset="13636420">Now the question is what do we entitle to the middle of the river.</text>

            <text syncTime="3390.142" offset="13663901">See it was about four part Orleans up here and the channel came out, in other words when they made the survey in 1840-1841, they made it on the west bank of the furtherest island so we say that it would make a lot of difference in coming out of here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.988" offset="13731297">Now in that survey, they also found what they called Doom’s Island right of the Neches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.657" offset="13765987">That was in the survey and referred to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3444.019" offset="13879463">As a matter of fact, it is kind of unusual, Your Honors because Texas, in their motion for judgment and memorandum with respect to the motion, on page nine, they admitted this, they say that Congress permitted Louisiana to include within its state boundary all of the eastern half of the Sabine including all islands within the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.958" offset="13995238">So we say that they only changed their position later in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.999" offset="14011329">As a matter of fact, we have a letter from Mr. Gouge that urged the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.738" offset="14038288">In other words, he urged that they were entitled to the west half, exclusion of all the islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.249" offset="14072351">So, Texas in its own brief, and they already stated in this case, they admitted Louisiana was entitled to all of the islands in the Sabine.</text>
