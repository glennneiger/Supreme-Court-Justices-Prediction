            <text syncTime="56.747" offset="330376">To review that court’s judgment, reversing the judgment of conviction by the District Court in remanding to further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.019" offset="363499">The action was commenced by criminal information in April 1971 against respondent, Pennsylvania Industrial Chemical Corporation, hereafter referred to as PICCO.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.591" offset="413759">The Company was charged in four counts with violating Section 13 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, the so-called Refuse Act, which in relevant part makes it unlawful without first obtaining permission from the Secretary of the Army to discharge into any navigable water of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="142.663" offset="674043">I suppose they weren’t anybody canoeing on the Monongahela in December?</text>

            <label>Mr. William Bradford Reynolds</label>
            <text syncTime="147.121" offset="691806">Well, at least nobody apparently was sampling the discharges on the Monongahela after that date, but the date of the offenses though were August 7 and August 19, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.425" offset="749066">Now, the discharges involved here flowed into the Monongahela River admittedly a navigable water from two pipes owned by PICCO and used by the Company to carry off treated waste matter left in the manufacture of chemical compounds used in Industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.527" offset="825448">One of the pipes, an iron pipe, served only PICCO’s plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.857" offset="846764">The other, a concrete pipe, served the plant primarily, but was also used by six private residences nearby essentially to discard used laundry water.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.683" offset="898069">On August 7 and again on August 19, 1970, the discharges from the two pipes were sampled by private citizens, and the samples were turned over to the Allegheny County Bureau of Test for chemical analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.350" offset="960763">This analysis revealed that the effluent flowing from PICCO’s pipe contained a disproportionably high amount of aluminum, some iron, chloride, phosphate and other chemicals all in greater amounts than were found in the midstream waters of the river, and an unusually high quantity of suspended solids.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.153" offset="1051982">At trial, PICCO took the position that the industrial waste it was discharging into the Monongahela River did not constitute prohibited refuse matter under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.593" offset="1101720">First it argued that the Refuse Act covers only river deposits that impede navigation, not non-impeding liquid solutions of the sort involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.083" offset="1151666">In the alternative it urged that the discharge from its plant was nothing more than sewage, and thus came within the explicit statutory exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.755" offset="1194402">Both of these contentions were rejected by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.673" offset="1210075">They were renewed in the Court of Appeals and also rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.780" offset="1226480">No cross petition was filed by respondent in this Court seeking further review of those rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.887" offset="1250931">And thus the application of the Refuse Act to discharges of the type involved in this case is not at issue here, because the judgment under review is based on the premise that the act apply to these discharges.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.327" offset="1312684">Rather, the issues before the Court relate essentially to the second proviso in the act which provides that the Secretary of the Army “may permit” the deposit of otherwise prohibited material in navigable waters if navigation will not be adversely affected thereby, provided that application is made to the Secretary prior to depositing such material.</text>

            <text syncTime="822.992" offset="3395375">Let me look just briefly to the language of the Refuse Act and this second proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.144" offset="3419930">The Act itself speaks in broad terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.023" offset="3431424">It bans all discharges of refuse matter into navigable rivers, or into navigable waters except sewage.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.132" offset="3459950">But under the second proviso, the Secretary of the Army “may permit” certain forbidden discharges “provided application is made to him prior to depositing such material.”</text>
            <text syncTime="855.958" offset="3527241">Now, this proviso does not speak in terms of the formal regulatory program.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.578" offset="3549706">What Congress did in 1899 was to vest in the Secretary discretionary authority, in those instances where a prior application is made, discretionary authority to immunize from criminal prosecution discharges that would otherwise being unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.872" offset="3618879">How, when and in what circumstances he might exercise that authority were left to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.410" offset="3648972">In this regard, the 1899 Refuse Act was no different from the predecessor statutes on which it was based, neither the Act of 1890 nor the Act of 1894, both of which imposed a flat ban on the discharge of enumerated substances in the navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.948" offset="3727130">Neither of those statutes called for the establishment of a formal regulatory program under which permission to discharge would be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.837" offset="3762761">Instead, the decision whether to permit a forbidden discharge was left in those earlier statutes to the discretion of the Secretary of War, he could act or not as he saw fit to accept particular discharges from the general statutory prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.537" offset="3841546">And this we think is what Congress intended by the second proviso in the Refuse Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.259" offset="3864430">If the Secretary wish to establish a formal regulatory program, it certainly was within his authority to do so under this proviso, but for some 70 years, he chose not to operate on that basis, rather he chose to act informally passing on applications only when and as submitted.</text>

            <label>Mr. William Bradford Reynolds</label>
            <text syncTime="988.373" offset="4056900">I thought you meant if the language had required, the statute required.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.598" offset="4069752">No, I think it would not make any difference under this language that whether there was a program set out, form a program set up or not would make no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.222" offset="4116250">I think what the proviso does is it provides a limited defense to a Refuse Act prosecution for discharges which the Secretary in his discretion may permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.885" offset="4162957">Now, under the Court of Appeals decision that limited defense based on affirmative action taken by the Secretary is converted to an absolute defense through a formal permit -- because the Secretary fails to exercise his discretion through a formal permit program, what the Court of Appeals decision does is turn the statute on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.394" offset="4248952">That which Congress in 1899 declared to be generally prohibited that is the continuous discharge of industrial waste into our nation’s waters becomes generally permissible in the absence of a formal regulatory scheme which Congress did not prescribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.501" offset="4329409">Now, apparently the Court of Appeals reached this result, not so much on the basis of the language or the history of the Refuse Act, but rather on the basis of its reading of later Congressional enactments in the water quality field, particularly the Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 as amended through 1970 but not the 1972 Amendments which have alluded to and which were enacted after this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.452" offset="4437138">But this water quality legislation, the Court of Appeals suggest can’t be reconciled with the 1899 prohibition, unless we read enforcement of that prohibition is turning on the existence of a formal regulatory program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.397" offset="4492936">I might just interject that this problem of reconciliation, whatever it might be has been in large part resolved by the 1972 Amendments where Congress itself incorporated the two acts in essence and certainly reconciled them in that legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.864" offset="4578826">But before that in the earlier water quality legislation, Congress provided explicitly that that water quality legislation was not to be construed as impairing or affecting the prohibition of the Refuse Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.266" offset="4648417">Moreover, the water quality legislation and the Refuse Act don’t across purposes as the Court of Appeals seemed to suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.596" offset="4681749">Both arraigned that the same end, the cleaning up the nation’s waters, but they used different means to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.145" offset="4711946">Now, we’ve spelled out in our brief the structure of the Water Pollution Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.866" offset="4734830">Essentially that legislation contemplates a cooperative effort by the states and the federal government in establishing and enforcing water quality standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.603" offset="4785821">But prior to 1972, that is the new amendment in 1972 to this water quality legislation, prior to that time the water quality legislation contained no penalty provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.880" offset="4838902">Discharges which reduced the quality of the receiving body of water below the set standards was subject only to lengthy proceedings which could possibly ended in a abatement order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.986" offset="4887280">Thus, the Refuse Act which was saved by Congress, the Refuse Act of 1899 essentially provided the teeth to the clean water program.</text>

            <text syncTime="1232.567" offset="5033671">The State of Pennsylvania’s Water Quality Standards were approved in 1967 by the federal government and there’s no indication that the Company has gotten a permit -- a certification from the State that it was inline with the 1967 water quality standards, but --</text>

            <text syncTime="1250.729" offset="5106291">If it is your submission that the Refuse Act did no more than provide the teeth for enforcement of the Water Quality Standards Act, I should suppose the first inquiry in this case, if you’re right, would be whether or not this discharge violated the water quality legislation, wouldn’t it?</text>

            <label>Mr. William Bradford Reynolds</label>
            <text syncTime="1267.001" offset="5171388">Well, I think that would be first inquiry to be made on submission of an application to the federal government for a permit, but the point that we’re making in this case is that the Refuse Act precludes those discharges which fail to meet the water quality standards, and also even those that arguably do meet them until you first go to the federal government and get permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.805" offset="5270549">Now, the 1970 water quality legislation that’s the earlier amendments required that these companies submit to the federal government certification that it met the water quality standards in its efforts to obtain a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.925" offset="5335124">And the Refuse Act would -- it would be no violation if they’d gone to the federal government and they’d submitted a certification that they did in fact comply and then they’d been permitted by the federal government to discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.540" offset="5389563">But in this case, we don’t have any inquiry made by the Company whatsoever to the federal government with respect to a permit for these particular discharges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.511" offset="5437419">Now, the Company’s argument is that they were affirmatively misled by the Corps of Engineers into believing that a permit wasn’t required in this situation since its discharges did not impede navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.510" offset="5497396">And principal reliance with this argument is placed on the Corps of Engineers early regulations, which in 1968 or until 1968 indicated that the Corps reviewed its responsibility under the Refuse Act as I am quoting from those 1968 regulations, as “directed principally against the discharges of those materials that are obstructive or injurious to navigation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.580" offset="5617664">Now, in view of these earlier regulations and the fact that there were many industrial plants up and down the river that were discharging industrial waste in the same manner, PICCO argues that it could properly assume, and I use that word advisably, it did not go to the Corps of Engineers and asked about these discharges, it didn’t make any inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.021" offset="5691434">It says that it could properly assume that it needed no federal authorization for its non-impeding discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.822" offset="5726647">Well, I think this Court in 1966 made it clear in the Standard Oil case that the Refuse Act proscribes discharges of refuse matter having no adverse effect on navigation to the same extent as it prescribes those discharges that in fact impede navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.098" offset="5811806">And the fact that the 1899 statute had not for many years been enforced as vigorously with respect to the non-impeding discharges cannot be held to diminish its force today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.544" offset="5865514">We think the essential point here is that following the Standard Oil decision, the Corps of Engineers changed its view of its responsibilities under the Refuse Act with the respect to administering activities in navigable waterways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.564" offset="5933641">And as we spelled out in our brief, the regulations issued -- no, the regulations on which PICCO relies were withdrawn in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.814" offset="5974601">New regulations were issued by the Corps and they were published in the federal register, and they served notice that the Corps will consider pollution and conservation factors in passing on applications for permission to use navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.314" offset="6036668">In addition, and this Mr. Justice Powell goes to I guess your earlier question, in addition a number of actions both criminal and civil were commenced in 1968 and in 1970, a large number of actions under the Refuse Act against companies that were discharging non-impeding industrial waste into the rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.174" offset="6128097">In fact, as early as 1967 the Third Circuit, the same court that rendered the decisions below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.001" offset="6155368">The Third Circuit held that that activity, that’s the non-impeding discharges that that was unlawful in or like Steel which is perhaps the case most often cited in this area at lower federal court case most often to cite in this area, was to the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.415" offset="6233004">It was decided in 1969, and indeed there’s no court decision that we’ve been able to find prior to the offenses here that held that the Refuse Act was not, was limited to, just to discharges that impede navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.613" offset="6301863">In short, the scope of the criminal prohibition had been authoritatively settled well before PICCO made the present illegal discharges into the Monongahela River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.802" offset="6350555">Moreover, the Corps announced in the summer of 1970 sweeping changes in its regulations pertaining to permits for work in navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.936" offset="6391097">We have set forth that announcement in our appendix to our main brief, with specific reference to the Refuse Act, it also announced in July 1970 and this announcement is in both our main brief and our reply brief, but there is a misprint in the main brief and that’s why we incorporated it in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.844" offset="6486706">In July of 1970, it made the following -- issued the following announcement and let me just read quickly the first paragraph of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.454" offset="6521187">It says “the Corps of Engineers today announced new permit requirements under the Refuse Act concerning all discharges into navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.891" offset="6558908">Permits will be required for all industrial discharges into navigable waters and their tributaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.787" offset="6582523">New permits will be required where existing permits were granted without adequate consideration of the quality of the effluent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.353" offset="6612825">Permits will also be required for current discharges into navigable waters where no permits have been granted.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.852" offset="6650755">Now, we believe that it’s clear that if PICCO had made even the most superficial inquiry after 1968, it would have known that it needed a permit to discharge this kind of industrial waste into the waterways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.255" offset="6728391">It made no such inquiry, and we think that without such an inquiry in the face of the change in the regulations, the clear pronouncements by this Court and other lower courts, and the clear pronouncements by the Corps of Engineers that it cannot now be seen to rely on the defense that it was affirmatively misled into believing that this conduct was lawful and was not prohibited by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.763" offset="6830373">For these reasons and the reasons stated in our main brief and reply brief, we submit that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed and the judgment of the District Court should be reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.719" offset="6874258">Mr. Chief Justice, if I have any time remaining, I’d like to reserve for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1700.070" offset="6903620">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.627" offset="6917831">Listening to the Government’s argument today reminds me very much of the lyrics of the Mikado, where Mr. Gilbert said the flowers that bloom in the spring tra la, have nothing to do with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.483" offset="6965269">And the Government’s argument has nothing to do with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.427" offset="6981047">He did not tell you Mr. Justice Powell, that the first attorney in the history of the United States since March 3, 1899 who has fought a case under that Act through to a jury verdict is me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.990" offset="7035382">That’s the first and only case that has come before this Court on a trial in a courtroom, and Your Honors have specifically reserved that, and that is why I did not go through motions and have the case come up here in the vacuum that it did in Republic Steel and Standard Oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.575" offset="7113644">You have to have the facts of the case, and in fact in the opinion of this Court in Standard Oil, the last paragraph says, we pass only on the quality of the pollutant not on the quantity of proof necessary to support a conviction nor on the question as to what scienter requirement the Act imposes as those questions are not before the Court on that restricted appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.251" offset="7224404">Interestingly enough in the footnote, since having dealt with the construction placed by the court below on the Sherman Act, our jurisdiction on this appeal is exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.188" offset="7260139">We are not at liberty to consider other objections to the indictment or objections which may arise upon the trial with respect to the merits of the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.155" offset="7295979">I don’t know what they mean the criminal charge or the charge of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.419" offset="7309040">I did attack both of those before the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.178" offset="7324087">Now, being trial counsel in the case perhaps gives me a little advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.656" offset="7341955">I’m a bit appalled when the Government tells this Court that there was no offer in the court below to prove that the discharges of which we stand convicted comply with the water quality standards of the Government of the United States say “you have this anomalous situation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.764" offset="7406425">PICCO has been fined $10,000.00 for violating a criminal statute which the Government of the United States says is not a pollution discharge under its own water quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.825" offset="7458670">Now, I would refer you to page 158 of the appendix that the Government printed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.916" offset="7483016">Despite the efforts of the court below to keep me from making a record that this Court would have, I insisted that certain offers be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.462" offset="7521259">One of them is, I also want to be on record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1862.856" offset="7554800">158 sir, at the top.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.778" offset="7570474">Mr. Lucani incidentally is a water quality control expert who at one time while the canoes were running up and down the Monongahela River, one of his employees filled the bottle and gave it to one of the bounty hunters in the canoe so that he would have it to take back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.215" offset="7636198">Mr. Lucani’s testimony, he would have testified if permitted that the discharges August 7th, August 19th that’s the discharges, and the specific analysis on every matter which is related to this and these information are absolutely within the prescribed limits of the Pennsylvania water quality standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.194" offset="7720103">This case was tried in June 1972 and I intended to prove as late as June 1972 that every item on the exhibits that the Government have the chemical analyses and attached to their brief, every item is below the standards that the Pennsylvania Sanitary Water Board in charge of this permits under our state permit, permits PICCO to discharge in the Monongahela River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.247" offset="7836400">And the court said yes but I’ve overruled that and to make sure that the record was clear I said “but it is not on the record” and I wanted to be that every matter discharged by this defendant, PICCO, is within the prescribed regulations of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania which have been adopted by the Government of the United States, and therefore insofar as this actually relates to our dumping, the case is referred to pollutants and refuse interchangeably and as to the government’s own regulations, what we were convicted of discharging as a pollutant is not a pollutant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.415" offset="7981014">And we’ve cited in our brief and I need not go in to that, but the Government has adopted specifically the Pennsylvania standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.007" offset="8015391">Congress has specifically said that the primacy of enforcing water pollution controls is in the States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1997.008" offset="8091355">I tried very hard, believe me, to get the Court to harmonize the Water Quality Acts which were passed in 1965, 1970 and the Refuse Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.169" offset="8128031">They can be read harmoniously together without putting the Government of the United States into the box that it has painted itself by actually being the one who muddies the waters of this whole situation more than anyone else.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="2020.104" offset="8183829">I understood the Government’s position to be that since you hadn’t cross-petitioned for certiorari from the Third Circuit that the existence of the offense wasn’t properly here.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold Gondelman</label>
            <text syncTime="2030.767" offset="8226461">Well, of course I find that argument very difficult to believe, because the Government has appealed from the Circuit’s finding number one, that Congress intended no crime under the facts of this case, and two, if Congress did intend such a crime, such a crime would violate due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.705" offset="8298141">I don’t know how this Court considered the Government’s appeal without getting into the merits of the case and whether or not a crime actually was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.678" offset="8330115">And on the issue of whether a crime has been committed, Justice Rehnquist, the issue seems to me to be what is refuse and in technology and Mr. Lucani’s testimony, he was completely almost as frustrated as I because he could not talk about pollutant and refuse, or define those terms because he said “I must know what the receptacle is into which the effluent is being discharged.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.371" offset="8436903">You see, they go out to the middle of the Monongahela River and find a little bit of iron and a little bit of sulfur and other solids, where if you came closer to the river and the millions of gallons, and I think even their test expert testified billions of gallons of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.402" offset="8493014">In water pollution science, you must know what the effluent is going into in a rate of water flow not dissolve and evaporate the water to get the solids out and make these exhibits sound like these were actually solids.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.946" offset="8563127">All of the discharges in PICCO’s plant were in a liquid state, not solid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.015" offset="8587473">And the fact is that what I tried to do is say to the Court, the word pollutant has a scientific present technology definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.108" offset="8631777">How can you charge a jury that we have no permit to discharge refuse, if in the science and technology today it is not refuse as that term is defined by the very science trying to work to clean up the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.925" offset="8695097">Mr. Lucani would’ve testified and I cited on the brief the fact that Pennsylvania and the federal government defined pollutants as things above a certain standard, above a certain discharge rate, and Mr. Lucani continuously said “I cannot tell you if this is refuse since, Your Honor, you have told me I can’t talk about what it goes into and the rate of the flow of the stream, in other words, you can’t let me testify as an expert which I am trying to do.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2191.177" offset="8868028">I must first say that such a finding with I think about the Court’s approach to this case, the lower courts understanding of this case in light of Republic Steel and Standard Oil was that it’s like when he was in Bolivia they told him that he couldn’t carry a cigarette lighter without a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.799" offset="8954546">He went down to get the cigarette lighter, they say “we don’t have permits” they confiscated the cigarette lighter, and this is the way this whole case was tried.</text>

            <text syncTime="2225.725" offset="9006268">I think one thing that you -- if you were just going to get to is staying that Court of Appeals judgment on the ground of refuse, but something else that you, I think you have to reach some other grounds as distinguished?</text>

            <text syncTime="2237.066" offset="9051617">I don’t have to reach another ground Your Honor, what I’m saying is that under these circumstances, the Court of Appeals has said that without a permit program and that I should be entitled to prove whether or not there was a permit program in effect, because after all the regulations and the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.184" offset="9124133">Unfortunately, the Government doesn’t quote these things completely to the Court, if they read the complete provided further however quote of the Act of 1899, incidentally it’s interesting that up until 1969, this was the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.345" offset="9204799">Congress has not amended that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.658" offset="9213994">The Government has amended it by continually referring to it as the Refuse Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.093" offset="9231757">It becomes the Refuse Act on December 23, 1970 in the Presidential Proclamation when he referred to the Refuse Act of 1899, but the Act itself Section 13 says “and provided further that the Secretary of the Army, whenever in the judgment of the Chief of Engineers anchorage and navigation will not be injured thereby.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.762" offset="9318379">The Government hasn’t read the next clause to you comma “may permit that deposit of any material above mentioned in navigable waters, within limits to be defined and under conditions to be prescribed by him,” then it says “provided applications made to him prior to the deposit of such material.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.424" offset="9433109">Now, the courts had been, the lower courts especially have been very concerned about whether the phrase comes after the semicolon or before the semicolon, I don’t know how anyone would diagram this sentence at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.233" offset="9472293">It would be an impossibility but it certainly seems to me that as the phrases flow the Secretary may permit the deposit of materials within limits to be defined and under conditions prescribed by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.080" offset="9531643">And what we find actually is that in 413 of the Act that is 33 U.S.C. 413.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.410" offset="9569050">“The Department of Justice shall conduct the legal proceedings under Section 407 and it shall be the duty of United States attorneys to vigorously prosecute all offenders against the same.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.084" offset="9623698">This was passed on March 3, 1899 with the Act we’re concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.568" offset="9645641">I happened to check, I find that there’re 28 Attorneys General to the United States, five of whom have graced this Honorable Court, and yet we find that no vigorous prosecution except for the Act of 1899 affecting navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.303" offset="9712619">Next we find, Section 419, this was a new statute passed in 1905 in which Congress said “The Secretary of the Army is authorized and empowered to prescribe regulations to govern the transportation and dumping into any navigable waters, or waters adjacent there to have dredging the earth’s garbage and other refuse materials of every kind and description.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.697" offset="9814183">The exact language in the Act of Section 407, the Secretary must prescribe regulations concerning the dumping among other things other refuse materials of every kind or description whenever in his judgment navigation will not be affected thereby.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.840" offset="9882728">So I say that the Secretary of the Army, if this was a pollution statute and if we require the permit, he had a duty to set forth in regulations what the permit would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.267" offset="9932466">I offered these exhibits in evidence and they’re part of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.535" offset="9945527">I think they’re exhibit 7, 8 and 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.923" offset="9955035">In 1939 and this comes to the Court of Appeals argument, Justice White, that the administrative rulings and interpretations caused PICCO not to apply for a permit any more than ask if anything else were required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.150" offset="10023999">In 1939, the information circular says “applications for authority to execute work or erect structures into navigable waters of the United States” nothing about pollution in this circular.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.051" offset="10071542">This was secured by subpoena to the Corps of Engineers to bring with them all of the regulations they had ever published under Section 407, this they brought.</text>

            <text syncTime="2518.659" offset="10178017">They then show how well they amended it in 1968, permits for work in navigable waters.</text>

            <text syncTime="2532.145" offset="10231933">Then we find, now we say that this is after the Presidential Proclamation which incidentally had a moratorium in the date you asked about, Justice Blackmun, was very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.297" offset="10276551">These informations are filed in April 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.293" offset="10288567">In December, the President issued an order to implement a permit program and you had until July 1st to apply for a permit, so that under the President’s own proclamation of December 23, there was an attempted moratorium to get people to now understand what had never been the law of this country that you needed a permit, because in 1971, the same regulation now says permits for work and structures in and for discharge or deposits into navigable water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.360" offset="10428792">And now we get to the need for a permit and it’s not a letter like Judge Teitelbaum kept telling me, but the permits are 5, 6 and 7 pages and require thousands and thousands of dollars to determine the quantity of the effluent, the vast technological data that is needed in order to apply for a permit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2873.106" offset="11595839">And it is definitely before this Court because the second holding of the Court of Appeals is that the circumstances here demonstrate that no crime was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.761" offset="11638366">And in that connection, they discussed the regulations of the Corps of Engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.314" offset="11656652">They discussed the lack of any affirmative permit program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.501" offset="11673370">They discussed the fact that we were affirmatively told that they was no permit program required until 1970, and then in the third part of the opinion it says “even if the Act of 1899 were construed to make PICCO’s activities criminal, due process considerations would require a reversal” and in that situation he says that PICCO acclaims that it was misled by interpretation given to the statute by the Corps of Engineers, and this is where we get to the offers of evidence, none of which was admitted in the court below, but which are attached to the brief for the consideration of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.385" offset="11820910">So I do believe that the Government’s petition for cert and this Court having granted cert directly places before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.765" offset="11846405">Was a crime committed at all if the authors in the court below had been allowed?</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.784" offset="11874513">Now, I think we briefly ought to get to the effect of what the Government is saying here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.797" offset="11894575">Since Taylor versus Reeser (ph), the Government has been enjoined from issuing permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.753" offset="11926340">Now, if we understand the Government’s argument today, then under the administrative absolutism that the Department of Justice as it has, every Industry in this country since the injunction has been issued where no permits are now available by a court injunction, every Industry that has been discharging without a permit is guilty of a crime obviously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.192" offset="12020172">It has to be the logical conclusion of the Government’s argument before this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.069" offset="12043682">We know that you cannot get a permit today because of that decision, it’s on appeal but at least for a year, a year and a half now nobody could get a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.730" offset="12078268">And yet a U.S. Attorney certainly could prosecute any Industry discharging into a navigable stream matters which did not affect navigation because they don’t have a permit, because after all, what difference does it make?</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.557" offset="12125602">They don’t have a permit only because the court has enjoined the Government permission legally?</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.440" offset="12145142">And if they have not committed -- if Industry has not committed a crime during the pendency of that injunction, then why doesn’t it logically follow that before the injunction if there was no permit program, there also was no crime committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.855" offset="12206791">Mr. Rockel says, the director of the EPA says that there’s no question that no one could get a permit under the Act of 1899, I have his citation in my brief, so that without a permit program because of court injunction or prior to that, certainly there is no crime committed here and that issue has been decided by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.696" offset="12314206">The court below took the position completely that it does not make any difference whether we could get a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.910" offset="12343045">The only way that we could not violate the law is not to discharge effluent into a river.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.113" offset="12371780">I suggest that if acquisition had been taken by United States Attorney in 1944 when Industry was going full blast to supply the war material for the boys in Omaha Beach in World War II, and the effect of that type of criminal prosecution would have been to advice Industry to close its doors, the U.S. Attorney would’ve been subject to uncertain great criticism if not internment for having taking an American activities approaches to the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.575" offset="12485674">The fact that they didn’t in 1943, 1944 in fact the fact that the Secretary of Army awarded -- awards to Industry during those periods are national crisis certainly would indicate that there is no criminal violation and they compounded in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.530" offset="12561533">The court below charged the jury that if the Secretary of the Army in his discretion decided not to issue permits, despite the fact that my entire offer was to show that the Secretary of the Army had actually exercised this discretion saying that no permits were required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.444" offset="12637184">In fact in the 1968 regulations when they talk about the Republic Steel case, the only change the core of engineers saw was that under Republic Steel, they were now obligated to assess who should pay dredging.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.305" offset="12708551">I think what has happened in this situation and the metamorphosis so called, they change from the Rivers and Harbors Act to a Refuse Act unfortunately comes abide in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.728" offset="12750242">Republic Steel came before this Court on a petition by the Government of the United States and if you read their briefs, you will find that they affirmatively told this Court that they are not in a pollution case, they are in a navigation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.804" offset="12802591">The entire brief on both sides talk about navigation, the opinion of this Court says we have pollution statute but that is over to think those were the facts that were before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.136" offset="12847940">Then you -- from there, we are led to Standard Oil, an accidental discharge in which the Court defined good gasoline aviation fuel as a pollutant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.435" offset="12893080">From those two cases we have now jumped the complete line to say that we now have in the United States and as I said, now they talk about a Refuse Act, but I think that when you see the Presidential regulations proclamation of December 23, 1970, you must ask yourself why did the President of the United States take time from a busy schedule to issue a proclamation implementing a permit program and talking about all of the laws dealing with water control in the implementation of that program. He did it because there was no such program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.866" offset="13030797">The Water Pollution Control Act of ‘65, ‘70, ‘72 can be harmoniously read with the Act of 1899 if one defines pollution in terms of those acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.348" offset="13088789">This case has no impact whatsoever on future cases because of the Act of 1972, the Government admits that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.947" offset="13123166">This case and the thing that it must be understood here is that this case is not a pollution case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.996" offset="13151378">It has been brought here without attractiveness on the times of today, but the fact is that it is not a pollution case because if we are complying with state and federal standards concerning what went into the river, we could put the same thing into the Monongahela River today and I offer to prove that that we did in 1970 because they are within the standards of the Government of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.727" offset="13258271">The reply brief of the government again misrepresents what I offered to prove.</text>

The other is the twofold, first that Mr. Rockel says and I have that as part of my brief actually in an interview had said, I think it’s on page 7 (a) of my brief Your Honor, and I’m prepared to prove this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.627" offset="13897853">Mr. Rockel has theoretically should know something about the Act of 1899 since today he is the one in charge of the administration of the program, was asked if there was an overlapping in the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.442" offset="13941112">Second paragraph he says “it really isn’t entirely fair to say that the reason a person is being sued under the Refuse Act is because they don’t have a permit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3790.310" offset="15264580">I just want to make the point that the Corps of Engineers after 1968, after this Court decided the Standard Oil case and made it clear that the Refuse Act applied to non-impeding -- non-navigation impeding discharges and at that time it changed its attitude with respect to its responsibilities, this 1968 regulation which Mr. Gondelman showed to the Court was withdrawn.</text>

            <text syncTime="3868.753" offset="15578363">If they made the most superficial inquiry, they would have been notified at that time that there was in fact a permit available and one that they should have gotten before making these discharges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.992" offset="15627368">I would point out just in closing that in fact in November of 1970 which is after the time of these offenses, Mr. Justice Blackmun, the dates you were talking about earlier that in November of 1970 the Corps explicitly advised this company that their discharges from this plant into the Monongahela River was in violation of the Refuse Act without a permit and they would need a permit so that the permit -- the permits were available and had they made any kind of inquiry, they could’ve gotten this permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3912.490" offset="15753383">They didn’t and in the absence of doing so, we think that it was proper to -- the conviction was proper under the Refuse Act.</text>
