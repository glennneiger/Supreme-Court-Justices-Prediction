            <text syncTime="51.951" offset="311150">The basic claim relates to the Pyramid Lake Indian reservation in Nevada.</text>

            <text syncTime="114.043" offset="559522">Lake Tahoe is partly in California and partly in Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.057" offset="587630">The river runs for 20 miles in California where it obtains most of its water and then it flows for 65 miles in Nevada until it empties into Pyramid Lake.</text>

            <label>Mr. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="144.454" offset="681148">Pyramid Lake is fed by the Truckee River which has its outlet -- which is the outlet of Lake Tahoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.859" offset="718764">Lake Tahoe is located partly in California and partly in Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.700" offset="742170">The river runs for 20 miles in California where it gets most of its water and then it flows for 65 miles in Nevada until it empties into Pyramid Lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.419" offset="800998">The Court will note on the map just above the center, the Derby diversion dam and then the Truckee Canal, which diverts a substantial part of the water of the Truckee River into the Carson River system and the Carson River system with the water from the Truckee River produces the Newlands Irrigation District which is the green area in the right part of the map.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.149" offset="931924">The way the map appears, one could get the impression that the Carson River is also an outlet of Lake Tahoe, but that is wrong; the Carson River rises in the mountains to the east of Lake Tahoe and the water from Lake Tahoe gets to the Newlands Irrigation District through the Truckee Canal from the Truckee River and thereby represents water which does not flow on to Pyramid Lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.124" offset="1059819">Pyramid Lake is 30 miles north of Reno.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.760" offset="1078418">It's a remarkable lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.478" offset="1085315">Some say it's the finest desert lake in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.688" offset="1102137">The Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation originated on November 29, 1859 and was confirmed by President Grant by an executive order issued on March 23, 1874.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.913" offset="1175071">The Pyramid Lake Indians had a culture which was based primarily on fish on which they lived, and which they used for bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.716" offset="1218226">And the lake provided a large and remarkable fishery and the purpose of including the lake in the reservation was to maintain the source of the Indians' livelihood.</text>

            <text syncTime="337.164" offset="1452074">Pyramid Lake is the geological residue of an older lake called Lahontan and indeed the reservoir created in the Carson River is now called the Lahontan Lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.049" offset="1507558">And the fish in Pyramid Lake and that's part of the complaint here, the cutthroat trout in Pyramid Lake have been unable to maintain themselves because with the fall and the level of the lake, the fish are unable to get up the Truckee River to spawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.992" offset="1579342">Now the fish have been taken out and put into fish hatcheries and are now planted in Pyramid Lake and they are also found in some of the other lakes, but without the help of men, the Lahontan cutthroat trout would be extinct now.</text>

            <text syncTime="441.757" offset="1870451">In 1903, after the passage of the Reclamation Act in 1902, the Newlands Reclamation Project was established by the Secretary of the Interior named after a senator from Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.145" offset="1927920">In 1905, the Derby Dam was completed with the consequent diversion of much of the water from the Truckee River to the Carson River system.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.973" offset="1975254">As a result of this and other activities, the water flowing down the Truckee River to Pyramid Lake has been reduced to about 250,000 acre feet while 375,000 to 400,000 acre feet are required to replace evaporation losses and maintain the level of the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.794" offset="2074520">Because of this annual deficit of 125,000 to 150,000 acre feet, the level of the lake dropped more than 80 feet since 1906.</text>

            <text syncTime="620.373" offset="2584848">There has been a considerable entries in the amount of water and it is true that in the past six years, the level of the lake has risen by about ten feet so that the net fall of the lake at this point is about 70 feet.</text>

            <text syncTime="708.065" offset="2935620">On behalf of the Indians, through this suit, the United States contends that when the Pyramid Lake Reservation was established in 1859, the United States, by implication, reserve for the benefit of the Pyramid Lake Indians sufficient water from the Truckee River for maintenance and preservation of Pyramid Lake, and for the maintenance of the lower reaches of the Truckee River as a natural spawning ground for fish.</text>

            <text syncTime="1537.639" offset="6253902">At that point, it may well be that the two states can agree on their relative portions of the remaining water as they have agreed in a compact which is pending before Congress but not approved by Congress but based on the assumption that the Indians have no rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.969" offset="6319208">The compact does say that it doesn't deprive anybody of any rights but it doesn't recognize that there are any such right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.580" offset="6345644">The United States has no interest whatever in how the allocation to California and Nevada is divided among their individual water users and the District Court in Nevada can make the appropriate allocations among Nevada users if that question too is not settled by agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.980" offset="6435297">Now I have mentioned the compact and I don't have time to discuss it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.452" offset="6457135">It obviously is of no legal significance because it has not been approved by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.889" offset="6486915">Incidentally, both senators from California have joined in a statement and I mention this because it indicates the unlikelihood that Congress is going to prove the contract if both senators from California oppose it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.766" offset="6550444">They have joined in a statement in which they conclude, we therefore support the efforts of the tribe and Federal government to obtain a judicial determination in the Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1733.971" offset="7039248">And that threshold question, do the Indians have a right or don't they, can be presented as a purely legal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.447" offset="7073207">It becomes a little more complicated when you say, yes they have a right but what is its extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.081" offset="7095672">For example, the Indians do not claim that they are entitled 375,000 acre feet every year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.547" offset="7121586">Sometimes the water goes down, I think their position would be that they are entitled to an average of 375,000 acre feet over a period of, let's say, ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.838" offset="7162755">So that if it goes down one year, some water can be made available to the Newlands Project and it can be made up in subsequent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.105" offset="7199744">It's undoubtedly true that there have been differences of opinion and conflicts of interest within the interior department about this claim of the Pyramid Lake Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.466" offset="7245197">The Bureau of Reclamation and the Bureau of Indian Affairs do not always see eye-to-eye.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.345" offset="7268707">It's equally true that the Department of Justice has not advanced this claim in prior proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.262" offset="7296397">The Indians should not be bound about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.135" offset="7307891">There will be argument about res judicata and merger and bar and our position is that the Indian should not be bound to their great loss by reason of defaults which may have occurred on the part of officers of the United States in the past and I don't criticize them because they were reflecting a national attitude at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.287" offset="7400469">It was a great step when the Secretary of the Interior requested the department of justice to start this case in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.443" offset="7433174">It would be something of a tragedy for the Indians if this Court should now refuse to consider the claim made on their behalf.</text>

            <text syncTime="1852.973" offset="7515303">I am Barrett Prettyman and I represent the defendant State of Nevada in this original action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.160" offset="7535992">In the few minutes alloted to me I am not going to be able to discuss some of the purely legal questions in our briefs such as res judicata and collateral estoppel and even case or controversy against the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.248" offset="7588342">I am going to have to rely on our brief for those points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.644" offset="7606000">Instead my argument here is going to be restricted to the reasons why this Court should not in its discretion assuming that it has jurisdiction, why it should not exercise that original jurisdiction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.275" offset="7672456">In case after case, after case, this Court has emphasized, that state should work out problems relating to mutual boundaries or interstate stream themselves, if they can do it and in case after case it was only after such attempts that reconciliation between the states had failed that this Court had agreed to exercise its original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.552" offset="7785618">Now, here what do we have?</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.540" offset="7797530">We have the two states where the disputed water is located, agreeing after more than 15 years of negotiations on an equitable apportionment of the waters involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.148" offset="7847999">We have a joint task force that the government participated in after long study finally agreeing on recommendations which as is already been noted, have already begun to increase the water procurement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.505" offset="7905364">As a matter of fact, the water level has risen some 11 and 12 feet in the last few years, ever since the interior department has begun concentrating on their operating criteria and putting them in one shape.</text>

            <text syncTime="1969.197" offset="7980178">Well, in the first place, the Indians originally participated in the taskforce, withdrew, then submitted statements and witnesses in regard to the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.485" offset="8033364">They specifically made some objections to the compact as it was originally drafted and those objections were taken into consideration and this is quite important, let me give you two examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.280" offset="8080488">Originally, the California was given an unlimited right to create extra -- to create extra flow, to create extra water after the original Tahoe Basin was taken care of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.539" offset="8145481">The Indians objected to that and a 10,000 acre foot limit was put on California's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.626" offset="8165857">In another example the Indians were given a maximum right based on Orr Water Ditch plus municipal and other use which was actually being put to the beneficial use, they could not get anymore water after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.913" offset="8223013">That was eliminated because of their objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.084" offset="8231685">So that after their Orr Water Ditch commitment now and after California's share comes out, then the use goes back to Nevada again and the Indians have a full right to get the amount of money -- the amount of water that they can show that they need from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.434" offset="8301066">These are two examples of objections which the Indians had at the compact and which were taken care of in the compact.</text>

            <text syncTime="2509.414" offset="10141027">The interior secretory is operating criteria which he is now under order to improve here and which he is going to produce still more water, if he has jurisdiction to do it for pyramid lake are going to come a complete hall again because nobody is going to know what we are talking about here in terms of these Winters rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.749" offset="10210408">I emphasize to you that a Winters right is not some is not some definite specific figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.356" offset="10232769">You have to go back and find out what the situation was in 1859 at the time the reservation was created, what the Indians were doing, we are not as all sure as the Solicitor General that they were engaged in all this much fisheries for example and we have to go through that entire business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.696" offset="10298180">Orr Water Ditch which is a case which adjudicated we say that very rights that are under consideration here took I think it was something like 20 years for them to come to any conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.514" offset="10341439">Now Orr Water Ditch you understand already gives the Indians 30,000 acre fit a year, that is adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.004" offset="10371427">And we say that, that actually covers this case in is fully determinative, but even if it isn't, the fact of the matter is that what the Indians want they are either getting or about to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.254" offset="10420433">They want 385,000 acre feet, that is what their brief says, that is what the United States said, because 385,000 acre feet is going to sustain that lake at its present level, that is what they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.301" offset="10472573">Now when we turn to that what do we find?</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.091" offset="10487724">We find that there is been a tremendous amount of water increasing recently into Pyramid Lake because of the changes that I have talked about and we also have these specific recommendations of the task force, some of which you been carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.120" offset="10563897">Let me give you an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.684" offset="10570062">One of the things the task forces recommended was a Cloud Seeding Project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.118" offset="10587826">Well that sounds a little far out, but in true we are now into the third year because of that recommendation of the Cloud Seeding Project and they found in the first two years that there was a 14% and a 10% increase in precipitation as a result of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.675" offset="10650102">In hard cold fact, that 14% produces 140,000 acre fit of water, a 120,000 of which goes to Pyramid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.208" offset="10684165">This is one of the reason why Pyramid, we think is started back up again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.499" offset="10701406">There are other recommendations that the taskforce made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.356" offset="10712795">They said for example if you enforce your present decrees, if you will go into District court with the decrees that you have right now and enforce them that you will find, and they gave a specific figure of how much of that would produce, 9500 acre feet there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.232" offset="10776325">They talked about certain TCID improvements, the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District improvements which would produce another 85,000 and so we have these recommendations, part of which are being implemented right now and part of which we will be, if the court does not take things over, which we say is already beginning to sustain the lake and would certainly will sustain the lake if you do not take this case in which if everybody is allowed to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.063" offset="10891577">For example if you do not take this case and I might say we think that United States is suing the wrong party, we think here they ought be suing themselves because judge Gesell took the position that the Secretary of the Interior was not properly carrying out his responsibility and his own operating criteria and we say that if you combine these various factors, if you combine the compact, if you combine the recommendations that have been made some of which you have already been carried out, if you add into that judge Gesell's order about improving his operating criteria, you are going to have more than enough water for Pyramid Lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.093" offset="11043715">We hope, obviously I cannot guarantee that, but we say until these things have had an opportunity to show themselves, until we have had an opportunity and good faith to carry out what's going on here, why should we stop the whole thing right now after the 17 years, bring it all to a halt and suddenly have this Court appoint a special master and go back and begin determining for I do not know how many additional years what the Winters rights says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.859" offset="11150817">If there was a question about what they really wanted from these Winters rights, I would take a different position, but there is no question they want 385,000 acre feet.</text>

            <text syncTime="2784.902" offset="11242977">Number two, there are projects which have been recommended by the taskforce which require money and obviously I do not think the state can be expected to commit any funds, if we are willing to, with not knowing what the Indians were eventually going to get and also I do not think there is any question, but that judge Gesell's order be ignored in affect in ignorance of this Court were to take Jurisdiction because obviously a ruling here would in affect override much of what he has done.</text>

            <text syncTime="3034.142" offset="12239914">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.419" offset="12253080">California basically agrees with the arguments which have been advanced by the state of Nevada and we feel that very basically the Pyramid Lake problem is presently being solved by many alternative methods at the legislative level, the judicial level, the administrative level and we want the Court to -- as far as California is concerned, the real basic question between the Federal Government and the State of California and Nevada is not really how whether we are going to solve the Pyramid Lake problem, but rather how we are going to proceed to solve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.799" offset="12382542">Now the Federal Task Force has come in with a report about two years ago and said that, vast amounts of water were being wasted in the Truckee River basin by the Federal Government's own mismanagement of its own Reclamation project, the Newlands project, Task Force had made a number of recommendations provided the Federal Government could improve the facilities and improve the management of these systems and make additional water available for use in Pyramid Lake and if these recommendations are followed and are applied by the Federal Government, the problem of Pyramid Lake will be solved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.314" offset="12500616">Now the same approach was taken more recently in a lawsuit which or in a decision rendered in the Federal District Court in Washinton DC, judge Gesell presiding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.112" offset="12535829">This lawsuit was brought by the Indians against the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.030" offset="12551502">The Indians claiming that the Federal Government was violating it's fiduciary obligation to the Indians by wasting all this water in the river and thus failing to maximize the flow of the Truckee River into Pyramid Lake and judge Gesell upheld the position of the Indians and he said that the vast amounts of water were in fact being wasted in the Truckee River by the mismanagement of the Newlands project.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.662" offset="12638020">He then ordered the Federal Government to devise a regulation that will provide for salvage water which can go into Pyramid Lake and so if judge Gesell's decision is implemented by the Federal Government and is followed and the water thus required to be made available to Pyramid Lake actually made available again, Pyramid Lake would receive all the water that it needs and the problem would be solved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.351" offset="12724746">So there be no need for this Court or any other Court to really get involved with the question which is being posed by the Federal Government in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.305" offset="12756616">As matter of fact perhaps you will find, after judge Gesell's decision is applied and after the Task Force recommendation are followed that there is in fact, enough water in the Truckee River right now to satisfy all the demands which are being made upon it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3229.117" offset="13019826">The judge Gesell's approach and the Task Force approach is based on the assumption that we have to preserve existing water usage in the upstream area in the Truckee River basin and this is diametrically opposite from the approach being urged on this Court by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.890" offset="13078967">Suppose for instance, 385000 acre feet of water were flowing through the Truckee River in a very dry year, when less than a normal amount of rainfall occurs in the Sierras, the approach taken by the Federal Government would take the entire 385000 acre feet of water and put it solely for use in Pyramid Lake thus there would be no water left over for any upstream usage.</text>

            <text syncTime="3687.634" offset="14853935">Mr. Solicitor General we have gone over a little bit and we have heard some estimates as to the impact of what might happen if the relief you seek is granted and perhaps you could spend about three minutes in enlightening us on your view of those estimates?</text>

            <text syncTime="3703.892" offset="14918928">Mr. Chief Justice the suit pending in the district of Columbia was a responsibility of the Solicitor General to decide whether an appeal should be taken and the decision has been made that no appeal will be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.180" offset="14980054">Nevertheless, that case involves only the left-over, only the run off, only the water which does not go to someone else by right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.430" offset="15029060">It leaves – it does undertake to maximize the left-over and it will help the Indians but it gives them no right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.776" offset="15066467">That water can be appropriated by somebody else, it remain surplus water in the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.638" offset="15085902">It can be appropriated in California, it can be appropriated in Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.454" offset="15105233">The only way that the Indians can be protected is by having an adjudication that they have a right under the Winters Doctrine as applied by this Court most recently in Arizona against California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.511" offset="15177435">I am also advised that the Office of Management and Budget has authorized the filing with Congress of a statement that the Federal government opposes the ratification of the compact until this question is resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.909" offset="15243055">I would point out too that in the compact itself, in Article 18 (c), it is provided that the compact does not deal with the rights of any parties which are not specified in the compact and that was intended to leave open the question of what would happen if there was an adjudication of the rights of the Indians.</text>
