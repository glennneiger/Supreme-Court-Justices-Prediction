            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We’ll hear arguments next in 72-490 McDonnell Douglas Corporation against Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.939" offset="143130">Mr. Riddle you proceed whenever you’re ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Veryl L. Riddle</label>
            <text syncTime="13.063" offset="155669">Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.136" offset="183881">This case is before the Court to review the decision of the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.069" offset="215646">The plaintiff below who is the respondent here, Mr. Percy Green a black man, and the defendant below who is the petitioner here is the McDonnell Douglas Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.398" offset="276982">We’ll refer to the parties to this suit by their names Mr. Green and by McDonnell during the course of the argument to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.460" offset="329226">Mr. Green was a mechanic and had worked at McDonnell Douglass for 1966, up until the time of his layoff in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.745" offset="398399">During that period of time, he had established a work record that qualified him by the rating records and the supervisors at the plant as being of average, or suppose said another way, satisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.501" offset="481364">He was in that period of time, well up until 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.343" offset="508740">He was a member of the union and is such was protected by the union rights as it had bargained with the company for such as seniority and what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.543" offset="557537">However in 1962, the respondent here Mr. Green, became interested in doing some work outside of the work that he had been doing and made inquiry as to whether or not he could transferred over to the electronics division of McDonnell.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.840" offset="654712">At that time he was told by supervisors and by people with whom he worked that for him to transfer over to that division would cause him to give up what seniority rights and whatever protection he had under the labor contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.668" offset="742066">And it was pointed out to him that that new department that he was looking at was engaged in work related to the Gemini program and it could be a one shot contract, because of that there was some uncertainty as to the durability of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.195" offset="820120">Well, considering those factors, 1962 Mr. Green declined to transfer and didn’t make an application.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.873" offset="870902">A few months later the next year, Mr. Green again looked over at the other department and decided that maybe he should transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.681" offset="926072">The pay wasn’t significantly greater, but apparently it was a more prestigious position and would utilize his skills to a greater extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.283" offset="972466">When he looked at it the second time, he was again advised that “because you’re a member of the union now, you have a certain seniority rights, but and again this is the Gemini program and you may -- when you get over there as a non-union member or employee of McDonnell, you won’t have the security of the job that you have now.”</text>
            <text syncTime="240.824" offset="1066715">Well, in spite of that he decided to make the transfer and for approximately a year thereafter.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="248.306" stopTime="249.452">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="248.306" offset="1096600">It was 1963?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="veryl_l_riddle" startTime="249.452" stopTime="407.805">
            <label>Mr. Veryl L. Riddle</label>
            <text syncTime="249.452" offset="1101197">It was at 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.267" offset="1112482">For approximately a year thereafter, he worked there as a technician over in the electronics division working on simulators for the Gemini program.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.133" offset="1155950">Well, as was predicted by some, the program was winding down and there was a layoff coming up.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.900" offset="1206941">The company using a pattern, or using a practice in this particular essence that they had used before called the “totem pole” referred to in the case, made a determination that some of the excess technicians working on that program would have to be dismissed, and of course -- due course of time, Mr. Green and 14 to 15 others in fact were dismissed or laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.419" offset="1329089">At the time that they were laid off, the time that Mr. Green was laid off, he made some protest to his superiors and to some of the executives of McDonnell and pointed out that in his opinion he was being discriminated because he was a black man, and because he was a known protestor and leader in civil rights activities around town.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.855" offset="1434833">Pointed out that his position in those activities was such that the company would be taking some risk if they laid him off, but in spite of the various and prolonged discussions, he was laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.353" offset="1516753">Now, sometime after within a few weeks and in fact in October 1964, Mr. Green participated and was referred to in the record and in the briefs as a “stall-in” now this “stall-in” as was referred to by some of the witnesses in the case as an attempt to sabotage the facility and the operations of McDonnell.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.474" offset="1657292">I think to fully understand the significance and the impact of the other “stall-in” I would call the Court’s attention to pages 57, 58 and 59 of the volume one of the appendix.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="407.805" stopTime="410.002">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="407.805" offset="1734614">How?</text>
            <text syncTime="408.073" offset="1735659">Give me that number again?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="veryl_l_riddle" startTime="410.002" stopTime="500.022">
            <label>Mr. Veryl L. Riddle</label>
            <text syncTime="410.002" offset="1743391">It’s on the volume 1 of the appendix and at page 507, 508 and 509.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.669" offset="1778082">It’s the last two or three pages in the -- in that volume.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.386" offset="1808906">Now look at the plan that was devised by Mr. Green and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.218" offset="1840253">One could readily see that this wasn’t a carelessly planned program.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.670" offset="1874004">It was designed carefully and for the purpose of totally disrupting the flow of traffic to and from the plant facilities of McDonnell which are located on and near the airport, Lambert Field in St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.773" offset="1958431">The plan being to park cars on roads that led to the excess and roads that led away during a shift change where something between 10 and 1500 people are going to be going to and from on limited access, and this is not a case such as a football field where the roads coming into small directions.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.315" offset="2064593">This is a case where there’s an airport and the access roads are much more limited than in the typical installation.</text>

          <turn speaker="veryl_l_riddle" startTime="505.319" stopTime="505.776">
            <label>Mr. Veryl L. Riddle</label>
            <text syncTime="505.319" offset="2124675">Yes, it is.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="505.776" stopTime="506.348">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="505.776" offset="2126451">That’s what I know.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="veryl_l_riddle" startTime="506.348" stopTime="516.210">
            <label>Mr. Veryl L. Riddle</label>
            <text syncTime="506.348" offset="2128750">It’s right near the runways and in fact, the manufacturing facilities are principally on the runway itself, or on the airport itself.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="516.210" stopTime="517.013">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="516.210" offset="2168247">On the airport?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="veryl_l_riddle" startTime="517.013" stopTime="675.592">
            <label>Mr. Veryl L. Riddle</label>
            <text syncTime="517.013" offset="2171382">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.441" offset="2181099">So as a result of this activity, the participants in fact drove their cars and parked them at strategically located positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.188" offset="2232090">And at that time as the plan called for, they locked their doors.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.850" offset="2262810">They put their brakes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.415" offset="2277021">They shut their motor off, and planned to stay there in that position for at least one hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.112" offset="2307845">And they were instructed to stay there and resist being taken away unless the officers made certain explanations to them as to why they should leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.568" offset="2357687">Now, the impact of a complete “stall-in” or a blockage of traffic at that time and under those conditions could have and except for alert police activity, could have been catastrophic and could have destroyed an entire shift operation at the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.848" offset="2442742">And the amount of money and the amount of property potentially subject to destruction or damage as result to this is very, very substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.041" offset="2495509">Now, following that program, Mr. Green was arrested and pay the fine, found guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.815" offset="2558621">And sometime thereafter, I believe it was July the 2nd of 1965, Mr. Green had continued in his activities, some of with were lawful and some of them which were unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.422" offset="2629047">And at that time his group action locked the gates doors at a building that housed McDonnell Douglas personnel downtown.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.591" offset="2677739">At a time when the employees were attempting to leave the building, effect to this was to temporarily imprison the occupants of the building during a period of time that they would’ve been leaving.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.394" offset="2740955">And then on July the 22nd, just a few days after the lock-in at the Roberts building downtown, Mr. Green applied for a job as a mechanic at McDonnell Douglas.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="675.592" stopTime="683.996">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="675.592" offset="2805739">Does the record show whether or not he was employed during this period after his original layoff from your company?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="veryl_l_riddle" startTime="683.996" stopTime="940.261">
            <label>Mr. Veryl L. Riddle</label>
            <text syncTime="683.996" offset="2839385">Later record indicates that he was employed of and on, but I don’t believe the employment was steady or with one employer throughout that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.772" offset="2886510">Of course when he made this application the reaction from the people at McDonnell was predictable.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.835" offset="2918693">They said “No, we will not be able to use you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="710.037" offset="2943561">Following that, he filed his complaint with the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.297" offset="2960593">EEOC made its investigation and made its report.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.816" offset="2990686">They found that there was reasonable basis for Mr. Green to bring a lawsuit and he filed one at that time under Section 704 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.765" offset="3050454">Case come on for trial, well after a period of time had passed, Mr. Green filed his lawsuit in the United States District Court in Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.005" offset="3103431">It came on for trial before Chief Justice -- Chief Judge Meredith there and it was tried for about four days.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.051" offset="3143555">During the course of the trial, or before the trial actually begun, Green made an effort to amend his petition to include raise or cause of action under 703 in addition to 704 and that was denied by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.046" offset="3223594">The case went to trial under 704, but during the course of the trial Green attempted to interject 1981 Civil Rights Act as a basis for his discussion in the trial of the issues involving race.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.125" offset="3307917">At the close of that case, Judge Meredith made some findings, one of which was that the evidence shows that plaintiff’s civil rights activities were not considered as a factor and the decision to layoff the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.172" offset="3384090">And then he made these findings, and I think it’s important for the Court to carefully consider just what was before Judge Meredith and what it was that he found.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.296" offset="3432573">He says “The plaintiff contends the defendant violated 7043 because of his opposition to employment practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.521" offset="3465488">Plaintiff also contends in his post trial brief the defendant’s refusal to hire him was based on race and his participation in civil rights activities, violation of 1981 and this important to conclusion and finding by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.779" offset="3534451">The court feels that the court’s discussion of the case under 704 will effectively dispose of any claim arising under Section 1981.”</text>
            <text syncTime="868.767" offset="3578441">And these are the controlling standards that Judge Meredith applied in reaching his decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.734" offset="3614281">He says this, “The matter before the court’s controlling an ultimate fact the questions are whether the plaintiff’s misconduct is sufficient to justify defendant’s refusal to rehire, and two, whether the ‘stall-in’ and ‘lock-in’ are the real reasons for defendant’s refusal to rehire the plaintiff.”</text>
            <text syncTime="893.043" offset="3675512">The court finds that they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.781" offset="3698500">Then the trial court proceeded to say that the plaintiff there Mr. Green had failed to establish by the greater way to preponderance that the defendant’s refusal to rehire plaintiff resulted from racial prejudice or plaintiff’s legitimate civil rights activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.020" offset="3775404">It seems clear from the record and then again quoting this are, “that the defendant’s reasons for refusing to rehire the plaintiff were motivated solely and simply by the plaintiff’s participation in the stall-in and the lock-in.’</text>
            <text syncTime="929.115" offset="3819813">The burden of proving other reasons was on the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.384" offset="3844890">Now, the case was appealed and went to the Eighth Circuit.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="940.261" offset="3864430">But doesn’t that language sound like the District Court dealing only with the alleged 704 violation?</text>

            <text syncTime="1008.094" offset="4135790">And I think that it was for that reason that the trial judge, the district judge felt that under the contentions being made, that he could dispose of that issue in this case and did dispose of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1080.769" offset="4426480">Position to that Your Honor is this, that there was adequate discovery and there was enough discovery here to allow that issue to be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.535" offset="4465560">There were discovery opportunities available to the plaintiff’s counsel that he didn’t avail himself of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.592" offset="4493772">And voluminous records were in fact to made him available to any many use during the course of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.195" offset="4520103">We think that the ruling made in the pretrial as to the extent of the discovery was based upon the unreasonableness and burdensomeness of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.202" offset="4576214">It then required for tons in thousands and thousands of documents that were acquired weeks and weeks just to prepare all on issue that doesn’t seem to be irrelevant to of any issues that the case presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.384" offset="4644864">Now, the Eighth Circuit looked at the decisions below and affirmed it in every respect except it sent it back for a retrial on the racial discrimination issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.635" offset="4721873">Now, if the court had stopped there and used the basis raised by his Honor that it had been stricken and so maybe he didn’t had his full day in court and going back and try it again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.413" offset="4784985">If it stopped there, the case wouldn’t be here today, but the court did some very significant additions to adjust that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.312" offset="4828662">It said “One, that the prima facie case is made when the applicant here, a black man” -- I think I should read that exactly as it is from out of the court’s opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.936" offset="4927091">“When a black man demonstrates that he possesses the qualifications to fill a job opening and that he was denied the job which continues to remain open, we think he present a prima facie case of racial discrimination.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.490" offset="4993337">Now what that does is to reverse at the point when Judge Meredith says it was up to the plaintiff in that case to establish that his discharge or his -- the refusal to reinstate him was based upon his race that this was a burden that the petitioner or that the plaintiff had in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.619" offset="5097827">The Eighth Circuit is saying that he merely makes that prima facie showing and then the burden is upon the company of McDonnell here to establish that it was not racially motivated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.327" offset="5160730">Now, in addition to that the shifting of the burden of proof, I might say at this juncture that Congress in considering this one of the floor managers, we’ve cited that in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.891" offset="5222902">One of the floor managers carefully explained to members of Congress that the burden of proof in these cases under Title VII will be as it has always been that the burden will always be on the plaintiff, the person bringing the lawsuit and it made it abundantly clear that this was what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.469" offset="5317256">Here, the Eighth Circuit by its opinion is shifting that burden of proof, but that’s not all it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.187" offset="5344110">Second off, it said that subjective elements from the employer, in this case from McDonnell would be given little weight or its weight would be limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.866" offset="5422791">In the context of this case, and I might say further to that the third thing it said was that somehow McDonnell would have to establish or show that under these circumstances its refusal to rehire Green was related to job performance, while limiting the value or the weight of subjective evidence as the Eighth Circuit opinion did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.281" offset="5576495">Test the other imposition had plus the burden of weight shift caused one member of the Eighth Circuit to think that the effect of this opinion would be to order McDonnell to reinstate or rehire Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.014" offset="5643473">And the view apparently was shared by four members of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.258" offset="5668446">I think it’s clear when the employer here is inhibited by testifying as to his reasons, subjective reasons for making employment decisions that when that is being told or when the Eighth Circuit is telling the District Court that “you’re to give very little weight to that” that we think that that means practically that once the plaintiff Green here would make this prima facie case that we couldn’t rebut that prima facie case then by showing that our refusal to employ him was because he attempted to sabotage our plant, or locked some of our employees into the office building downtown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.129" offset="5887875">I think the Eighth Circuit is saying that this is to be given very little weight and it probably will not justify your actions in refusing to employ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.672" offset="5950046">Now there seems to be no question to what unlawful activity of any person would be adequate justification for an employer to refuse to hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.119" offset="6027891">And I think that would be true whether the applicant is white, whether he is an Indian or whether he is black, or whether he is a Baptist or a Jew, or Catholic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.159" offset="6075956">I think that that is clear and I think the effect of this opinion, if it’s applied literally, will cause a preempt reversal discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.838" offset="6134680">For example, I don’t think it could be seriously questioned that if a white man were to throw a rock in the chairman of McDonnell’s window last night and he called me this morning and says “Can I discharge the man?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.352" offset="6200822">I would say “Yes.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1654.402" offset="6720972">And Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I submit that Judge Lay’s comments that the Hebrew expression, “We tie their hands and have reproached them because they don’t use them” is a classic statement of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.089" offset="6775724">Because plaintiff Green attempted to get statistical information by interrogatories, by motion of produce for inspection, and on the question of interrogatories the court struck the interrogatories on the grounds that they were oppressive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.477" offset="6841240">On the question of the motion of produce for inspection, the court said specifically in its opinion that this is a race case and therefore you’re not entitled to all these statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.323" offset="6888678">So therefore, on two occasions plaintiff had to come in and try this case knowing full well what the decision of the court, 704 (a); both on the question of motion to produce for inspection and both in the comments of the court in its opinion that’s a 704 (a) case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2772.617" offset="11193866">I think Judge Johnson was still relating to the excised opinion, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.911" offset="11207032">He was still going into job performance in his second dissenting opinion and I had he read the decision a little more closely, he would’ve come the decision that the question of Griggs, Griggs was not before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.275" offset="11260426">The question of job performance was not before the court, and the court had carefully laid down very, very accurate and very precise standards for the District Court to be guided by.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.543" offset="11305566">I submit that there’s only one issue, and I’ve been kept from my discovery on race as to McDonnell Douglas is engaged in racial discriminatory practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.825" offset="11350706">I haven’t had that trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.653" offset="11358020">It hasn’t been tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.675" offset="11366066">I submit that Green should have that trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.315" offset="11372648">He should have an opportunity to show that the reasons given were protectoral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.558" offset="11385605">He should have an opportunity to show that the broad statistics, if there are any, and I assume that might be in view of what happened and which I’ve informed the Court about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.648" offset="11421968">About he racial discriminatory hiring practice at McDonnell Douglas and based upon that, I hope to prevail a District Court again if this Court gives me this opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.333" offset="11456658">Thank you very much.</text>

            <label>Mr. Veryl L. Riddle</label>
            <text syncTime="2846.634" offset="11489886">Mr. Chief Justice, I’m pained to have to correct my brother counsel here on the F15 contract which he mentioned to the Court to acknowledge that it was not on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.343" offset="11548714">The fact of the matter that contract has been awarded to McDonnell Douglas, and all orders made with respect to equal opportunity employment had been complied by and conformance with the executive orders for quite sometime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.542" offset="11609527">I’m pained to have to deny that off the record comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.718" offset="11638262">I would say in closing to this Court that this law Title VII has been tremendously beneficial in achieving the objectives identified by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.325" offset="11724675">And a lot of lawsuits had been filed at the District Courts throughout the country and the act has, I think, been a success, remarkable success.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.872" offset="11790817">This case particularly case as result of the opinion of the Eighth Circuit has created a lot of questions and has caused a lot of concern by members of the bar, by District Courts and by employers and employees as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.317" offset="11884648">I think that the cause of the complete reversal of the traditional principles that involve in trying this issue, were the only issue ever to determine the real reason why a person is refused employment, discharged from employment, or other action or relations that he has with his employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.513" offset="11989452">And to get at the real issue in the traditional sense, courts have done a good job and they’ll continue to do a good job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.070" offset="12027695">I think that there is nothing at all, nothing in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.768" offset="12042428">There is just nothing at all in the decisions in the past where you have a one on one, an individual employer or an individual applicant to make an application for a job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.270" offset="12100420">And this decision, if it’s followed and conscientious District Courts are going to try to follow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.419" offset="12133021">For them to try this, the law be turned on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.204" offset="12148172">And I submit for those reasons that the case certainly should be reversed, and we think it ought to go back, with an order from this Court that the judgment of the trial court who heard the evidence and who concluded that this sort of unlawful conduct was not protected and it would form an abundant basis for refusal to employ any person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.509" offset="12253393">Thank you.</text>
