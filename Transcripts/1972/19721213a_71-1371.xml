            <label>Mr. Burt Neuborne</label>
            <text syncTime="2.583" offset="113664">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.573" offset="125680">This case involves the constitutionality of Section 186 of New York?s Election Law, which imposes severe restrictions upon qualified voters seeking to join the political party of their choice and to participate in their party's primary elections in New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.556" offset="197569">The complex and often indirect operation of New York?s deferred party enrollment scheme is set out at length in petitioner's brief at pages 4 through 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.073" offset="243649">But while the operation of New York scheme maybe complex and difficult to follow, it's effect is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.631" offset="277922">New York?s scheme imposes two serious impediments upon the free operation of the electoral process in New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.373" offset="312822">First, it establishes a cut off period for participation in a party primary which is longer than the cut off period of any other state in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.719" offset="358275">In order to qualify to participate in a presidential primary in New York State which is in New York State are held every four years in June, a potential party enrollee must enroll in October of the preceding year, fully eight months before the party primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.777" offset="438523">In order to participate in a primary in a none presidential year which in New York state are held in September, a potential enrollee must enroll in the party in October, fully 11 months prior to the primary in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.844" offset="498709">Thus petitioners in the instance case, who registered to vote for the first time in December of 1971 and who sought to enroll in the party of their choice for the first time in December of 1971, were barred from voting in the June 1972 primary because their enrollments had not become effective on or before October 2, 1971, fully eight months before the primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.088" offset="607692">The second impact which New York statutory scheme has on the operation of the political process is to impose a waiting period of a substantial period of time between the attempt of a voter to join the party of his choice and the effective date of his acceptance by the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.745" offset="694314">Indeed, petitioners in this case who attempted to join the democratic party for the first time in December of 1971 and be completed solemn declarations of party loyalty at that time pledging to adhere to principles of the party and to support the candidates of the party generally at the next elections, will not be recognized by the state of New York as members of the democratic party until sometime between November 14, 1972 and February 1, 1973, a waiting period of between 11 to 14 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.193" offset="832136">Indeed, the drastic operation of New York?s law can be understood, if we apply it to a person in New York State who registers today for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.183" offset="872155">If one of the two million unregistered voters in New York qualified but unregistered voters in New York City were today to seek to enroll and to seek to register in a New York City registration office, he would be ineligible to participate in the primaries for the Mayor of the City of New York scheduled to be held in September of 1973 and his application to become a member of the political party in question would not become effective under New York Law until sometime between November 15, 1973 and February 1, 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.565" offset="1005589">The existence of so drastic, a curtailment of the political process poses very serious constitutional issues, but we should note at the outset that there are several issues which are not posed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.531" offset="1065462">There is not posed in this case any issue of internal party regulation in that the statutes in question are imposed by New York State upon the political parties of New York whether or not they wish to have them applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.016" offset="1123453">Indeed, in the instant case, the Democratic Party, the party into which the four petitioners sought entry in December of 1971, appeared in state Court in June of 1972 shortly before the primaries and requested that petitioners similarly situated, that that plaintiffs similarly situated to the petitioners be permitted to participate in the democratic primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.928" offset="1219062">That State Court preceding was dismissed because of lack of time and has not been re-instituted, but we should emphasize that there is no interest whatever in permitting the political parties in the state of New York to regulate themselves raised by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.830" offset="1290742">Nor does this case necessarily raise the arguably more difficult issue of party switching or the alteration of a pre existing party affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.927" offset="1331075">For the four petitioners in this case are all new registrants, first time voters, who are seeking to do nothing more than to register their initial party affiliation.</text>

            <text syncTime="400.495" offset="1705357">Can your narrower argument would be that the state?s interest against raiding, if it be a legitimate interest, can be adequately protected by dealing only with those who have been already registered?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="burt_neuborne" startTime="412.679" stopTime="710.850">
            <label>Mr. Burt Neuborne</label>
            <text syncTime="412.679" offset="1754049">Precisely, by dealing with the potential class from which, if raiders are to come at all, they will come.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.786" offset="1794487">I suggest to the Court there is now pending before the Court, Casper versus Panticus, an appeal from a three-judge court in the Illinois District Court in which the issue of crossover participation, the issue of switching from the republican party to the democratic party was discussed by the Court below, the statute was declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.683" offset="1874108">And that case I understand is now pending on appeal before this Court now so that if this Court wish to address itself to the broader issue of crossovers as well as initial party affiliation, it could do so in the Panticus case.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.105" offset="1947773">The basic issue as we see it therefore raised by this case as well in New York may play such drastic obstacles in the path of persons seeking to register and record their initial party affiliation and we think the most obvious legal disability inherent in the New York scheme is that it obviously operates as a durational residence requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.654" offset="2042023">Indeed, New York State, I do not understand to argue to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.536" offset="2057488">It is conceded that any person who established a residence in New York on or after October 2, 1971 was ineligible to participate in the June 1972 primaries and it is conceded that any person who established to residence in New York on or after October 14, 1972 is currently ineligible to participate in the September primary scheduled for September 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.037" offset="2159470">Instead of responding to the argument on the merits, New York has argued only that the petitioners as persons who are long time residents of New York lack standing to raise the durational residence requirement issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.332" offset="2216730">But there seems no doubt that petitioners have suffered an injury in fact at the hands of the New York?s differed enrollment scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.980" offset="2251316">There seems no doubt that they possess the classic adversarial posture concerning the continuation of New York?s differed enrollment scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.363" offset="2284857">And this Court in similar situations in the past has permitted petitioners situated similarly to the petitioners in this case to advance the arguments with persons who share a basic community of interest in dealing with the allegedly unconstitutional scheme before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.190" offset="2352149">Thus in Pierce versus the Society of Sisters, Thornhill versus Alabama, Barrows versus Jackson, Griswold versus Connecticut, Eisenstadt versus Baird and most recently in the Chief Justice?s opinion for unanimous Court in Bullock versus Carter, the Court permitted the petitioners before the Court to raise the arguments of persons with whom they were united in interest in seeking to deal with an allegedly unconstitutional scheme, especially when the continuation of the allegedly unconstitutional scheme would have an inhibitory effect upon the exercise of fundamental constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.245" offset="2492374">Moreover, the Rosario case was brought as a class action on behalf of all persons who were being impeded in attempting to join a political party by the operation of New York?s differed enrollment process.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.421" offset="2537096">Judge Mishler in his opinion in the District Court specifically noted to be a class action and thus we suggest that the petitioners herein have classic standing to assert the arguments of the members of their class as to the unconstitutionality of Section 186.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.713" offset="2606268">Although the durational residence requirement, we suggest is the most obvious violation of the constitution before the Court, quite clearly New York?s statute operates on long time residence as well to violate their right to vote and participate in the political process.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.134" offset="2683904">This Court in the past decade has forged a rigorous standard which must be applied to state statutes which restrict the operation of the franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.333" offset="2728730">The test that?s most recently formulated by the Court in Dunn versus Blumstein is whether the state statute at issue advances a compelling state interest by the least drastic means.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.551" offset="2773556">New York State argues first that because this is a primary election we?re talking about instead of a general election, that some lesser weakened diluted constitutional standard should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.167" offset="2820054">However, this Court has recognized for 30 years that the right to vote can be entirely frustrated unless it also includes the right to participate in the nominating process.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.529" offset="2861537">Indeed, as the Chief Justice noted in Bullock versus Carter, often the outcome of a primary election is even more important than the outcome of the general election because quite often you have one party safe seats.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.789" offset="2910542">This is specially so in a state like New York where one party strongholds have existed since the civil war and there were numerous primary elections.</text>

            <text syncTime="734.409" offset="3041050">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.135" offset="3055888">When we adjourned for lunch, we had begun to discuss the argument made by New York state that because this is a primary election that we?re dealing with here instead of a general election that some more relaxed constitutional standard maybe utilized to judge state statutes restricting the interested parties from participating in such an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.882" offset="3166856">And I had invited the Court?s attention to a line of precedent which begun 30 years ago in this Court and culminated in the Chief Justice?s recent opinion in Bullock versus Carter in which he pointed out that the outcome of a primary election is often more important than the outcome of the general election itself and that for precisely those reasons, if the right to vote is to receive adequate protection, it must also include the right to participate in the process by which the candidates are chosen.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.995" offset="3299349">And indeed, that has been the law in New York State pursuant to New York State Law since 1911.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.299" offset="3332577">Thus, whatever the constitutional standard is that is to be utilized in judging the constitutionality of state statutes restrictive of the franchise, petitioners submit that the same standard must be utilized in judging statutes which restrict participation in primary elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.353" offset="3416795">The state argues, however, that even if one applies the compelling state interest test to the statutory scheme before the Court, New York is able to meet that test because the statutory scheme deters bad faith raiding of a political party by persons not in sympathy with the parties principles who will attempt to participate in that party's primary election to in some way injure the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.994" offset="3527346">However, even assuming that the state has a compelling interest in guarding against bad faith raidiing and I suggest to the Court that a very real question exists as to whether the state possess any compelling interest at all in prohibiting persons attempting to affiliate with a political party for the first time to affiliate with that party.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.519" offset="3609475">But even assuming that the state does possess some compelling interest in the prevention of fraudulent participation in the primary, it?s clear that at least five less drastic alternatives exist by which New York State could advance its commendable interest in this case without at the same time causing the broad disenfranchisement of thousands of New York voters each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.643" offset="3697977">First and most obviously, New York already has a very effective device to guard against bad faith raidiing.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.484" offset="3733295">Section 332 of New York?s Election Law provides that a person enrolling in a political party maybe summarily dis-enrolled at the instigation of a member of the party after a hearing before a party functionary upon a finding that the attempted enrollee was not in good faith in his attempt to join the political party.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.263" offset="3820440">The operation of Section 332 in New York State has been one of extreme effectiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.174" offset="3844054">Indeed, the history of Section 332 in New York State demonstrates beyond argument that it has been an effective tool to deal with precisely the evil which New York state contends Section 186 is designed to deal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1116.561" offset="4569631">It is in the codification of the election law in 1909 that has been continued forward to the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.577" offset="4601710">Chief Judge Mishler writing in the District Court noted the effectiveness of Section 332 as a device to guard against party raidiing and I note in passing that Chief Judge Mishler spoke with a great deal of experience before his elevation to the bench in 1961, he was the chairman of the Queens County Republican Party and had been its candidate for public office on a number of occasions, is familiar with the operation of the political process in New York and recognized Section 332 for what it is, a very effective device to guard against bad faith raidiing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.177" offset="4732113">A second less drastic alternative open to New York would be to apply these restrictive affiliation rules only to those political parties who want them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.307" offset="4772551">In other words, if a party thinks that it is some way being endangered, it could, I suppose New York could if it wished to setup a statutory scheme that allowed a party some option in protecting itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.711" offset="4822183">New York has not chosen to do this, has chosen instead to impose these restrictive rules on parties whether or not they wish them and indeed in this particular case, the Democratic Party went to Court to say precisely that it didn?t want them and nevertheless, was forced to live with them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1209.971" offset="4943287">I think the first answer is that, if that?s what is necessary to permit persons to vote, the fact that it would be administratively more difficult to operate would not be a sufficient justification for not utilizing it, but I do not believe that it wouldn't -- that it would create substantial administrative problems because it would be perfectly possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.249" offset="5024371">We only have -- we four parties in New York State, the Republican, the Democratic, Liberal and Conservative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.015" offset="5043388">It would be perfectly feasible if the legislature of the State of New York wished to permit those parties to opt for some form of differed enrollment process and simply have the registrars make the entries as to who is a party member at the point in time which the political party wished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.728" offset="5118307">In other words, those parties which did not opt would have the entries immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.167" offset="5136071">Those parties which did opt could if they wished, have the material in the enrollment box for a period of time, but the same number of entries would have to be made by the administrative officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.221" offset="5188211">It would simply be making them over a longer period of time, indeed, it might Your Honor, it might be administratively easier to do it this way because the way the system works now all party enrollments in a year must be entered by the officials in a very short period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.345" offset="5244740">As soon as the enrollment box is open in mid November, every enrollment that?s been made during a preceding year must be entered within a very short time, creating a very serious administrative backlog for the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.114" offset="5291865">Part of the option might have the effect of spreading it out over a longer period of time and making it administratively more workable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.739" offset="5314330">I do not suggest that I?m in favor of the party option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.954" offset="5323212">I merely pose it to the Court as a possible less drastic alternative which New York could have utilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.289" offset="5348498">A third less drastic alternative which we discussed earlier was the application of this particular statute to the class which even arguably the only class which even arguably posses a danger of raidiing and that?s those persons who have a preexisting party affiliation and who are seeking to alter that preexisting party affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.893" offset="5434911">Every single instance of raidiing which has been cited in the New York reports and which has been discussed by the Attorney General has involved persons of a preexisting party affiliation attempting to alter that affiliation to participate in the affairs of another party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.232" offset="5496351">Indeed, no other state except New York has found it necessary to apply these types of restrictions to persons seeking to newly affiliate with a political party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.852" offset="5542745">In City of Phoenix versus Kolodziejski, Mr. Justice White writing for this Court noted that it would not be permissible for a state to base electoral restrictions upon a hypothetical possibility not reasonably likely to occur and in that case, he pointed out that only 14 other states had similar restrictions upon the franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.726" offset="5618291">Well, this case is even dramatically more insubstantial, in that no other state has seen fit to impose this type of restriction upon persons attempting to affiliate with a political party for the first time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1410.571" offset="5745664">If Ohio, Illinois, California, Pennsylvania can get along without this type of restriction applied to newly enrolled persons seeking to merely to register their initial party affiliation, it?s inconceivable to know that New York requires this type of drastic, drastic restriction which has the effect of barring persons in the similarly situated from the petitioners from participating in the primary despite the fact that they tried to enroll in that primary over six months before it was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.803" offset="5874604">The fourth less drastic alternative would be a reliance upon the loyalty oath which New York State currently requires persons attempting to enroll in political party to sign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.955" offset="5919222">In order to enroll in a political party in New York, one must file a solemn declaration of adherence to party principle and a solemn declaration of intention to support the nominees of the party at the next general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.639" offset="5969899">That requirement forbids casual party affiliation in New York and it has the effect of making it virtually impossible for large casual party switches to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.360" offset="6036773">In other words, we must assume if there was to be an evil in New York State that persons will fraudulently execute this affiliation, these enrollment blanks and it is we believe inconceivable to think that large scale fraudulence switching will occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.844" offset="6114722">Finally, if large scale fraudulence switching does occur in violation of the party loyalty oaths, New York maintains a comprehensive system of criminal sanctions for fraudulent participation in the electoral process which is Mr. Justice Marshall pointed out in Dunn versus Blumstein can be used effectively to guard against fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.242" offset="6192358">So that really what New York has done here has not used the least drastic alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.640" offset="6209912">The only way to describe what they?ve done is they?ve used the most drastic possible alternative to deal with this problem and they therefore, and in so doing have unnecessarily disenfranchised thousands and thousands of New Yorkers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.686" offset="6262157">Even if this case did not involve voting rights, even if it did not involve a delusion of the franchise and the triggering of the compelling state interest test, it would never the less raise the most serious questions under the association freedoms protected by the first amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.857" offset="6334777">Because the effect of New York statutory scheme is to create a waiting period which forces persons attempting to join a political party to wait as long as 14 months before they?re accepted into that party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.199" offset="6380126">Now, the right to join, the right to associate with the political party for the advancement of common beliefs is the core association of freedom protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.108" offset="6411786">It is the most important association of freedom we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.286" offset="6424534">Now, before New York can impose this type of drastic and unique interference with the operation of that associational freedom, it must come forward and demonstrate some overwriting societal interest which can be advanced by no less drastic means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.396" offset="6480959">That is precisely the test that Mr. Justice Harland used in his concurring opinion in Williams versus Rhodes when he analyzed the impact of the Ohio Election Law and ruled that it had an impermissible constitutional effect upon persons attempting to associate for the advancement of common political goals in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.745" offset="6558386">We suggest that it is no coincidence that the test, the constitutional test which Mr. Justice Harland utilized in Williams versus Rhodes is very similar in operation and effect to the compelling state interest test which Mr. Justice Marshall utilized in Dunn versus Blumstein.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.460" offset="6633200">They worked very, very similarly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.293" offset="6640515">They come out just about the same and they do because they are both designed to protect the single most important values that we can possibly have in a democracy which is the right to participate in the political process by which our leaders are chosen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.962" offset="6695267">That is an ultimate First Amendment right as well as the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.601" offset="6709791">And we suggest therefore that even if as Mr. Justice Harland did in Williams versus Rhodes, even if one is to choose the crime where Evans versus Cornman done a line of authority and analyses this case solely as an association of freedom test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.073" offset="6767679">The interests which New State has advanced are far, far less compelling than most which this Court has rejected in association with freedom cases in the past.</text>

            <text syncTime="1714.283" offset="6960462">The statute in question, New York State Election Law Section 186, the enrollment box statute simply provides that enrollment blanks in party are placed in a box and are removed after the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.448" offset="7037158">What this means as has been pointed out is that for an enrollment to be effective of the primary next succeeding, it has to be done before the general election.</text>

            <text syncTime="1773.482" offset="7197341">However, the next Section of the law, special enrollments provides that persons who have reached voting age after the general election can get a special enrollment and immediately enrolling in a party up to 30 days before the primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.786" offset="7270484">There are number of other exceptions provided in Section 187.</text>

            <text syncTime="2435.298" offset="9844590">Well, it shows where their concern is at one particular primary in the personality of one particular candidate or perhaps one particular issue and I think the argument that the petition is made that a person has the right to join a party to advance the interest of a particular candidate or a particular issue strikes at the heart of our political party system which contemplates the people joining the political party because they generally attuned to the basic theories of government of the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.534" offset="9969560">Now, once again, I recognized that our political parties are fluid in the United States and I think that?s the beauty of the differed enrollment system, a person who joins the Democratic party in a national election year such as this year could effectively join say the Liberal party for a municipal election which is coming up next year and in the following year, join the Republican party for the state election if he feels the issues are different.</text>

            <text syncTime="2513.735" offset="10158268">And involved herein is the integrity of the close party primary in the State of New York which includes not just Democratic and Republican parties but rather the two other minor parties, the Conservative and Liberal parties which have very limited enrollments and especially when you get down to an assembly district basis primaries in two minor parties can be controlled by very few votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.917" offset="10267042">It?s very easy to take them over with members of other political parties or for that matter well organized Independents with interest and typical to the political party.</text>

            <text syncTime="2566.318" offset="10368606">Kentucky has a similar system as to people who have affiliated with the party, you cannot switch your party enrollment between the periods of the general election in the primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.609" offset="10421791">And also from my reading of the Kentucky statute would say that this would include anyone who registered to vote by failed to enroll in a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.723" offset="10450213">However, there is a provision as it said for new registrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.635" offset="10469961">I do think though that most dates or a goodly number of states are trying to accomplish the same thing as the State of New York is trying to accomplish here to reduce the possibility of party raidiing and the fact that Section 186 is an effective means of doing it as the Court of Appeals below pointed out does not mean that it is in an improper means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.507" offset="10561390">And I think this brings us to the issue of just what is the nature of primary?</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.307" offset="10592632">And a primary is not a general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.878" offset="10610918">It is setup to allow party members to select their candidates and as such it replaces caucus or a convention and the vote is properly limited to party members and if you don?t close your primary and some states don?t close them, you have the possibility, indeed, the probability of raids.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.194" offset="10708198">I think this is demonstrated, its always been the case in states such as Wisconsin, what happen to the spring is instructive and I would submit that state has the discretion to define the constituency of a political party so long as the definition does not permanently exclude anyone who may wish to be represented and that?s exactly what is done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.437" offset="10797119">The enrollment is taken but it is differed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.317" offset="10836616">Now, we have I think at this point, I have contended that I do not think that it is necessary to apply the compelling state interest test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.097" offset="10883741">I would contend that the traditional rational basis test is perfectly applicable to this type of control of the exercise of the franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.264" offset="10932433">This is not a disenfranchising statute and I think the fact that it applies to all vote is equally in primary voting is indicative that you can apply the rational basis test.</text>

            <text syncTime="2802.755" offset="11314343">However, if we have to meet the compelling state interest test, I think we have to go no further then look at the Court of Appeals opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.037" offset="11347571">I don?t think there?s too much dispute at this point that there is a compelling state interest in preserving party integrities and avoiding raids.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.174" offset="11384038">And as such, the statute achieve its ends by the least drastic means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.086" offset="11435760">I object to this test because theirs is a, the Chief Justice has said in very short past that this tests demands perfection and yet still 186 has met this test, it meets it because the suggested alternatives are not truly viable when you consider the dangers of large scale raidiing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.670" offset="11550072">The discussion of the party dis-enrollment statutes Section 332 demonstraids as in the decision of the court below that it is in ultimately time consuming and ineffective, it would be ineffective in space of large scale raidiing, the point being of course in the course of the cases that with 186, you don?t have too many 332 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.951" offset="11667205">The fact is the 332 is simply supplement to Section 186 and there is no doubt in my mind that if we had to rely solely in 332, we?d have a much more serious infringement to First Amendment rights with the Courts inquiring into voters political belief and the genuineness of those beliefs which is avoided with Section 186.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.162" offset="11775979">And as to this alleged infringement of First Amendment rights, it should be noted as the court said below, 186 is designed to minimally infringe on first amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.400" offset="11852988">A person has the right enroll in a party; these petitioners have the right to enroll in a party.</text>
