            <label>Mr. Henry G. Ullerich</label>
            <text syncTime="30.493" offset="225364">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.373" offset="236857">The constitutionality of the California candidate filing fee system is the subject of this direct appeal on the judgment of a three-judge Federal District Court, granting a preliminary injunction against the California Secretary of State and the various county clerks in the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.696" offset="310105">The injunction in affect mandated the California Secretary of State to accept declarations of candidacy in the last primary election without payment of the statutory candidate filing fee of 1% of the annual salary of the office sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.249" offset="388368">At least as to those members of the class of the plaintiff below who were willing to file an affidavit with the county clerk that they had insufficient money or property to personally pay the candidate filing fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.332" offset="448658">The issues presented by this appeal from the judgment granting a preliminary injunction is, does California Elections Code, Section 6552, which imposes the statutory filing fee violate the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.512" offset="525458">Subsidiary issue is what is the appropriate standard of review when this statute is challenged in the judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.416" offset="569031">An additional issue is whether this case is controlled by the decision last term in Bullock versus Carter, 405 U.S. 134 and the final issue is if a less stringent standard of review is applicable herein, other than the standard imposed in the Bullock case, does the California candidate filing fee have a rational basis which would be sustained under the traditional rational basis test under the Equal Protection Clause?</text>
            <text syncTime="148.738" offset="698284">Factually, California requires a party primary election in even numbered years preceding the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.664" offset="734020">For the name of a candidate to appear on the primary ballot in June of even numbered years, the candidate must obtain declaration of candidacy forms from the county clerk and at that time, he is required to pay a candidate filing fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.155" offset="799953">There is no method for a candidate’s name to appear on the primary ballot without paying the candidate filing fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.069" offset="831613">Basically for state or federal office, that fee is either 1% or 2% of the annual salary of the office.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="190.570" offset="865677">In that respect, why is it the percentage, why isn’t a flat fee?</text>
            <text syncTime="194.197" offset="880201">Isn’t it cost the state as much to process something for the dog catchers, it does for United State Senate?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="henry_g_ullerich" startTime="201.446" stopTime="269.502">
            <label>Mr. Henry G. Ullerich</label>
            <text syncTime="201.446" offset="909145">The answer to that I believe, Your Honor, is that the -- a particular flat fee over the years with the inflation that we have would tend to be perhaps minimal at one period of time and then become rather excessive in other periods of inflation or depression periods.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.766" offset="994408">I think the annual salary, I mean, the basis the annual salary is pegged in more to the actual benefits at the end of a rainbow, if you will, and as the salary changes, the fee also changes somewhat.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.741" offset="1050311">I think also, there is a consideration of rather than being pegged at a very minimal fee of say, as was suggested in one case of $10.00 or $15.00 to handle the actual cost of handling the papers would not achieve the state objective that these candidate filing fees are designed achieve, that is to avoid overcrowding of the ballots fragmentation of votes or discouraging frivolous candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.519" offset="1161488">The fee must be something more than a merely nominal fee to accomplish that purpose.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="269.502" stopTime="275.188">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="269.502" offset="1181341">But you are charging candidate A more than candidate B, if they are not running for the same office?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="henry_g_ullerich" startTime="275.188" stopTime="320.648">
            <label>Mr. Henry G. Ullerich</label>
            <text syncTime="275.188" offset="1204120">That is true, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.406" offset="1213001">As you’ll see from our statutes that are reported in our brief that these would vary from no fee at all, if there is really no compensation for the office to 1% or 2%, and the distinction for the 1% or 2% that seems to be apparent in the statute is that let's say statewide office, for instance the United State Senate or a Governor or Lieutenant Governor and so forth, there would be some activity on the part of 58 county clerks or county registrars or voters in regard to that particular candidate whereas if you’re running from a particular district such a member of Congress or State assembly or State Senator, there is usually only one particular county or a limited district that would be involved in processing those papers.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="320.648" stopTime="357.420">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="320.648" offset="1385932">But then also as I understand your argument, you first quote the language in Bullock, recognizing that the state has a legitimate interest in regulating the number of candidates on the ballot and preventing clogging of its election machinery by frivolous candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.371" offset="1452805">And your argument is that a $10.00 or $15.00 fee wouldn’t keep a candidate for Senator or Governor for a wholly frivolous, a non-serious one off the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.698" offset="1494183">You need a higher figure to accomplish the state purpose whereas a $10.00 or $15.00 fee probably would keep off frivolous candidate for dog catcher, isn’t right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="henry_g_ullerich" startTime="357.420" stopTime="440.492">
            <label>Mr. Henry G. Ullerich</label>
            <text syncTime="357.420" offset="1533053">That would be true, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.655" offset="1537964">I think we have -- we are not riding on our clean slate anymore following that language in Bullock.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.594" offset="1561788">As we pointed out in our brief down in New Mexico, a Federal District Court invalidated the 6% of the annual salary filing fee for candidates for the United State Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.754" offset="1614346">Following that Federal District Court ruling, there were 40 candidates who filed for the United State Senate and appeared on that ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.676" offset="1646111">Only four of which paid the candidate filing fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.246" offset="1660322">We haven't had a real experience in California because the decision below was rendered on March 9, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.135" offset="1691878">March 10th was the cutoff date for candidates to get their declarations of candidacy and their sponsor certificates into the county clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.886" offset="1726882">So with the limited publicity and the limited time, we haven't had the full experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.832" offset="1746735">But if we can extrapolate a little bit from New Mexico to take, say the city of Los Angeles, if one candidate for every 50,000 people would appear on the ballot, we would have like 50 candidates running for Mayor of the city of the Los Angeles, and certainly there has to be something, some gauge to make sure that candidates have a modicum of support and a sufficient backing to really be termed a serious candidate.</text>

            <text syncTime="453.175" offset="1916113">Well, I think the reasons we have to give for that is really by history of a candidate filing fee, Your Honor is that, the part of it, the -- these candidate filing fees came into avoid this overcrowding.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.750" offset="1986330">Really the theory was to give people a more rational choice by limiting their choice somewhat. If you have too many candidates, you really couldn’t understand all of the issues in the candidate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1343.194" offset="5476185">I question as to whether that is a sure fire alternative means to the problems that we express.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.971" offset="5515264">It may involve money to get a lengthy nominating petition either to go out and hire somebody to gather the signatures, we have this problem quite frequently in California with our statewide initiatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.130" offset="5567927">You may have to get someone to go out and stand in the shopping center to collect the signatures and they might want some nominal money to do that, assuming you have a lengthy nomination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.969" offset="5603244">There maybe some charge by the county clerks who will then have to check those signatures to see if they are qualified signatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.888" offset="5630934">For instance, registered voters to determine just who were signing these petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.387" offset="5652877">There is some case law for instance in New Mexico, the New Mexico Supreme Court pointed out that they have tried this and it really wasn’t very effective because people have an inclination to sign anything whether they really know the person and know whether is a bona fide candidate or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.699" offset="5738141">That also again, I think is an element of discrimination against the person who for instance is employed and doesn’t have the time to go out and gather the signatures that the unemployed or the indigent person might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.481" offset="5793311">And of course, it will again open up the argument that requiring a lengthy nominating petition of say 3,000 signatures might be a more onerous requirement than somebody who is more affluent would be able to simply right out a check.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.896" offset="5850990">So, I’m not sure that that’s a final solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.816" offset="5862588">I think its something certainly more legislatures including the State of California could seriously consider, but I don’t feel it’s a matter of constitutional mandate that every alternative has to be tried in cases such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.558" offset="5949628">We didn’t -- well, on this point, too much on the brief, but the Bullock case decided last term concluded in that case that because of the Texas candidate filing fee system which basically was a fee which prospective candidates couldn’t know in advance, it was a fee determined by the county political committee as an assessed cost of the total cost of the primary elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.585" offset="6097690">There was some suggestion in that case that the strict standard of review may not apply in those jurisdictions which have a more reasonable candidate filing fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.308" offset="6144606">I would merely like to point out at this time that I think this problem that we have about -- if a case involves an actual deprivation of voting, such as the durational residency of those cases where the state has the burden of justifying the statutes by a compelling public interest, as opposed to the old traditional rational basis test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.069" offset="6251604">It may not be an either or.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.550" offset="6257560">We really have a case here that perhaps because there is some association of voters involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.207" offset="6284204">There is obviously elections and some voting rights are tangently involved that perhaps, there’s really as a test somewhere in between where there is neither a presumption of constitutionality nor such an overwhelming burden on the state to justify the statutes and I think we’re saying here that either of these three tests, we think we have a sufficient quantum of state interest to justify these laws where we feel quite confident that this case really doesn’t fall in the same category as those cases which involve that actual deprivation of voting rights so that terribly stringent standard would be applicable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1723.721" offset="6998288">The essence of this case as we see it, is that the State of California bars a citizen from running for Congress or for almost every other elective public office unless he first pays to the State, a substantial sum of money described, perhaps euphemistically, as a filing fee and Chief Justice’s opinion for the Court last term in Bullock, footnote 29, he indicates that the term “filing fee” is perhaps a misnomer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.020" offset="7211447">Since the amount of the fee, there is no relation whatsoever to the cost of filing or processing the application.</text>

            <text syncTime="1871.637" offset="7589909">In Bullock perhaps, the case was even stronger in that fees were extraordinary large, particularly in relation to the local offices.</text>

            <text syncTime="1885.913" offset="7647065">County judge, county judge, the fee could be fixed as high as $8,900.00 and the two offices that were particularly involved in the Bullock case, County Commissioner fee was $1,400.00 and the county judge, another office and another county was $6,300.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.709" offset="7734209">Now, the Court as Your Honor points out, emphasized that the full burden of the costs of conducting that primary election in Texas were imposed on the candidates, and that had the necessary consequence of making the size of the fees very large and that was a factor, one of the factors that was stressed in the Bullock opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.935" offset="7851133">The Bullock opinion went beyond that and as we read it, the Bullock case stands for the proposition that where a filing fee is imposed by the state and where it has the effect of excluding candidates from access to the ballot and thereby necessarily disenfranchising their supporters if a candidate is not on the ballot, his supporters have no opportunity to vote for him and in the very real sense, their right to vote in relation to them is not a meaningful effective right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.442" offset="8069099">So that the court in Bullock was dealing, although the context factually was one of candidate filing fees, with an impairment of the right to vote and it applied to that classification based as it was upon wealth or the lack of it, influent, affluence, poverty, money, a classification which the court has held is highly suspect one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.021" offset="8203473">A classification which had as it necessary result, the impingement of the fundamental constitutional rights of voting and political association.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.024" offset="8259480">The court applied the compelling interest test, held that the state had not borne the heavy, if not impossible burden of justification that arises in such a case and held it unconstitutional.</text>
