            <label>Mr. Edward R. Korman</label>
            <text syncTime="38.141" offset="255979">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.088" offset="267682">The United States appeals from the judgment of the district court for the Eastern District of New York, striking down as unconstitutional, an act of Congress, which required the payment of a $50.00 filing fee as a condition to a grant of a discharge in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.336" offset="340720">The district court held that the statute and the orders in bankruptcy promulgated by this Court, which provide that the filing fee may be paid out over a period of nine months -- up to nine months in installments after the filing of the petition were unconstitutional as applied to an asset-less debtor who alleged that due to his poverty he was unable to promise to pay the filing fee, even in installments.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.232" offset="444270">Although the district court ordered that the discharge be granted, he indicated that he -- that the obligation to pay the $50.00 filing fee should survive the discharge and be paid when and if the petitioner of bankruptcy was able to afford it.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.716" offset="510203">The district court also held that the federal in forma pauperis statute, 28, United States Code 1915 (a) was inapplicable here since Congress plainly manifested its intent to abolish in forma pauperis proceedings of bankruptcy and substitute in its place a system of installment payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.809" offset="598601">The United States intervened in the district court to defend the constitutionality of the statute and the district court granted a stay of the order of discharge pending the resolution of this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.406" offset="648965">Briefs and the opinions below understandably dwell on what it is that this petitioner of bankruptcy has been deprived of as a result of his inability to pay the $50.00 filing fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.827" offset="698702">But I think it is important that the issues, and I think that the issues raised here can be seen in their proper perspective only by first examining what it is that Congress has given, an indigent asset-less petitioner of bankruptcy despite his inability to pay this $50.00 filing fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.812" offset="774666">Initially, it must be observed that it is no long as far as an indigent debtor is concerned, this is no longer a filing fee that we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.492" offset="817298">Under the statute the petitioner of bankruptcy may file his petition without paying any fee at all, provided that he indicates on how he proposes to pay that filing fee in installments for up to six months, and the period may be extended for yet an additional three months.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.682" offset="890128">Now, that filing of the bankruptcy petition carries significant legal consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.254" offset="912384">He is automatically adjudged to be a bankrupt, and as a result all of his earnings following the filing of the petition are exempt from his creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.998" offset="959404">And so what Congress has in effect said to an asset-less debtor, said, if you feel that you have earnings that you want to immunize from the reach of your creditors, you can file your petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.359" offset="1016769">You will have up to nine months to pay and as those earnings which you expect and anticipate come in, you will pay us out this $50.00 filing fee over a period of up to nine months, and I should point out that in actuality the filing fee as far as asset-less debtors go is really $40.00, $10.00 goes to the trustee, and since it is an asset-less debtor, there is no need for a trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.582" offset="1109661">On the other hand, if as this petitioner alleges, he does not anticipate any income, he does not anticipate sufficient income to pay off his $50.00 or $40.00 at a sum of about a dollar a week, then Congress may rightly inquire why it is that he needs this discharge to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.016" offset="1191476">That is, the discharge becomes meaningful only when the possibility of additional assets and income becomes a reality, and when those additional assets become a reality then the $50.00 filing fee does not present any impediment at all to such an asset-less debtor.</text>

            <text syncTime="340.651" offset="1465971">On the other hand, if he appears on January 1 and he says, I don't expect to have any income for the next six months, why is it that the Congress can may rightly ask, why it is that this gentleman needs a discharge to begin with?</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward R. Korman</label>
            <text syncTime="405.101" offset="1723747">It did operate up until I believe 1968, it operated at a substantial surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.226" offset="1744227">At the moment it's operating at a deficit and Congress is in fact considering now that it is operating on a deficit perhaps repealing, but this decision to abandon in forma pauperis petitions in bankruptcy, which was made in 1948, was based on a Congressional finding of what happened during the years when in forma pauperis applications were available.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.529" offset="1845478">What happened was in those years while you could file a -- get in forma pauperis treatment in bankruptcy, the referees were paid and received their salary only out of the fees that they actually collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.064" offset="1895633">The referees then would allow the petitioner to file his petition, but simply refused to grant them the discharge until they were paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.896" offset="1926980">And what Congress found is, is that, in almost every case, given a period of time in which to pay out the filing fees, they were almost invariably paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.234" offset="1964283">So Congress said, that seems to us to be a much better procedure for handling these in forma pauperis petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.591" offset="2001690">Let the petitioner of bankruptcy file his petition, we will give him up to nine months to pay, and then he can obtain his discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.584" offset="2037739">In essence, this was really a reasonable substitute for the in forma pauperis proceedings and in practice it does not operate harshly, in practice the only test of whether you get a discharge or not is need.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.940" offset="2095104">That is, if you need the discharge because you expect the income, you can file your petition without paying anything, and as that income which you anticipate comes in, you can pay out this filing fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.818" offset="2138676">On the other hand, if you as this petitioner do not expect to have any income to pay it -- pay this $50.00, then you really do not need the discharge, and in fact, Congress is really saying, our bankruptcy courts are overburdened as it is, when you need the discharge, we will give it to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.176" offset="2208057">Now, I think this legislative program is a perfectly reasonable effort on the part of Congress to compromise between on the one hand the indigent debtor and on the other hand its desire to see that those who benefit from a particular legislative program contribute to its costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.743" offset="2278379">I think clearly there is a rational basis for this classification and certainly no basis to strike it down on equal protection grounds as the district court apparently did.</text>

Due process required a court, a hearing in court, as Mr. Justice Harlan held for the Court, that it must have been because he decided that the dissolution of this fundamental human relationship was of liberty within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, and we have a liberty within the meaning of the Due Process Clause and the state saying that the only way you can get this essential liberty is to come into the courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1185.408" offset="4844962">And as a matter of fact, I think one of the major debts about which this petitioner complains is thousand dollar debt to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, which he claims they say he stole from them, and therefore they have an action converging against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.530" offset="4905462">Now, the New York Statute of Limitations for an action in conversion is three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.925" offset="4927091">According to the petition, the the conversion, act of conversion alleged, that took place in May of 1969, probably he has been discharged already by operation of the Statute of Limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.314" offset="4972648">So that unlike Boddie, and I think there were two essential distinctions here, both crucial points of Boddie.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.256" offset="5004413">In the first place the state has not monopolized the means of dissolving this debtor-creditor -- this particular relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.945" offset="5035133">It can be dissolved by the parties themselves, the debt can be compromised, and indeed it could be discharged simply by inaction of the creditor over a period of time until the statute of limitations runs out, and in the second place, as far as an asset-less debtor goes, certainly, the right that's involved here hardly approaches an importance and significance, the right of an individual to decide whether he is going to live with another person in the institution of marriage and indeed the right to remarry again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.472" offset="5157282">And so that on those two essential grounds we feel that Boddie is inapplicable here and indeed I would point out that the district court, although he cited Boddie a good deal, did not really rely on the language in Justice Harlan's opinion, but relied instead on the concurring opinions and on Justice Black’s dissent from the denial of certiorari on the Garland case, which was a case in which the First Circuit upheld the $50.00 filing fee, and this court denied cert almost immediately after the decision in Boddie.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.747" offset="5278386">And this opinion of Mr. Justice Black that the district court I believe cited in effect unequivocally stated that it rejected the reasoning of the majority opinion in Boddie.</text>

            <text syncTime="1848.332" offset="7496704">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.402" offset="7513004">It is ironic considering the broad purposes of the Bankruptcy Act that appellant would argue that Mr. Kras is just a little too poor to be entitled to a bankruptcy discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.516" offset="7561488">I would like to briefly focus, since appellant has not, Mr. Kras' financial plight and its relationship to the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.610" offset="7597850">Mr. Kras can be characterized as a man who is down on his luck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.577" offset="7613628">He was last steadily employed in 1969 for an insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.730" offset="7630242">Premiums that he had collected were stolen from his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.056" offset="7647587">Basically, he was discharged from his job and he was basically accused of stealing the premiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.702" offset="7666186">Each time he went to apply for employment, bad references of the insurance company followed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.560" offset="7685622">Meanwhile, his debts began to accumulate, he was harassed by creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.351" offset="7704743">He found himself on public assistance and his wife is home taking care of a handicapped child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.235" offset="7728358">This is a man who can be characterized as completely frustrated and a failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.973" offset="7747271">He sees no way other than a discharge in bankruptcy to extricate himself from his present plight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.659" offset="7777991">This man is a natural candidate for a bankruptcy discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.378" offset="7796903">Congress in enacting the Bankruptcy Act understood that one of the most fundamental liberties an individual has is his right to earn a livelihood, and they recognized that on some occasions a man becomes so overwhelmed by debt, so harassed by creditors that he becomes immobilized, that he has nowhere to turn, and Congress enacted the Bankruptcy Act, not in the narrow reading of what appellant says, not merely as economic relief, the interest of society at large was at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.065" offset="7919679">They wanted not only to relieve the man of his debts, free him from creditor harassment, they were interested in emancipating him from his debts and giving him an opportunity to start afresh.</text>

            <text syncTime="1973.551" offset="7997628">Well, as a practical manner perhaps, but I would like to point out at the outset that this individual would not have been allowed to file his petition, but for the district court declaring it unconstitutional, because there was no way for Mr. Kras to promise that he would be able to pay in six months, $40.00 or $50.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.363" offset="8068786">That petition would have been dismissed immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.273" offset="8076413">There would have been no stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.194" offset="8084146">The only reason there is a stay in this case is that the United States District Court declared the fee unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2038.533" offset="8257494">These are people who are, you know, have lived with debts and creditor harassment and they need something dramatic to give them a chance, and that dramatic gesture is what the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act is, to tell him that he is discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.145" offset="8303992">The man is -- personally, he has another chance, and the United States government makes a laughing matter of it, but he has a chance to somehow be personally vindicated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2061.163" offset="8347982">If, and as happened, the insurance company does not come into the bankruptcy court, that debt would be discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.565" offset="8373582">Personally he will feel vindicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.435" offset="8381106">Now, in fact, he may still receive bad references from Metropolitan, but that personal vindication will have huge psychological implications to that individual; his ability to earn a living, to become rehabilitated and perhaps a productive member of society, and the mere stay just doesn’t accomplish that result.</text>

            <text syncTime="2105.049" offset="8523525">The fact that it does not survive now gives him a sort of personal vindication.</text>

            <text syncTime="2136.906" offset="8651003">I would say no Your Honor, it's not because the majority of bankruptcies that we have today are individuals and that's the reason there is a huge financial deficit in the system, are individuals with income with less than $4,000.00 who are subjected to creditor harassment and creditors do go after them and to judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.601" offset="8713801">Some of them by the way are default judgments, that today the reason that the system is not any longer self-sufficient -- self-sufficient since 1969 is that, if not a majority, many petitioners are people with gross income of less than $4,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.529" offset="8773465">Consumers, the bankruptcy court is now become what was hopefully designed to be a court for consumers also, not only for business people, and these consumers have less than $4,000.00 in gross assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.495" offset="8817351">And they are harassed, there are judgments against them, even though the creditor should know that these people do not have huge sums of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.452" offset="8845145">In fact, I should also point out that Congress never intended, there is no evidence at all that Congress intended that an individual such as Mr. Kras should be denied a bankruptcy discharge, or that he was too poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.582" offset="8893733">What happened under the forma pauperis provisions basically, the referees were extorting money from the indigents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.202" offset="8924139">They were making these people pay because that went into their fees, where they got -- some couldn’t pay and they didn’t get the discharge of this pay, and Congress in order to eliminate this inconsistent and unjust result setup a system of installment payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.119" offset="8983803">But there is no legislative finding or Congressional finding that an individual who is too poor for a discharge is not entitled to a statutory right to a discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.565" offset="9017657">There is no such finding in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.187" offset="9028106">In fact, today, there are many people that we have to turn away, because they do not have the filing fee and legal aid does not have any funds for it, and they cannot promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.344" offset="9068753">And prior to this case, we turned away many people at our trial office before this suit was brought, because we just -- there is no funds available and there was no way that they could promise to pay within six months, and then you have to get another extension for three months, so it was not quite nine months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.596" offset="9129775">But this individual is caught in a vicious cycle, and because he is so overwhelmed and so harassed, he has no where to turn, it's difficult for him to even seek employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.512" offset="9165406">He is defeated and exactly what the bankruptcy law was designed to do was to say, forget the debts, forget the creditor harassment, now we’re giving you an opportunity to start over, to rehabilitate yourself, feel free, and maybe then, not only will the debts be forgiven, but they’ll be forgotten.</text>
