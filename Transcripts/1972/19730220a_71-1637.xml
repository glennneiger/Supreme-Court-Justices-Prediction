            <label>Mr. Richard L. Sieg, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="18.873" offset="178866">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.818" offset="186598">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.710" offset="206242">The subject of this case is an airport, a privately owned and operated airport in a thickly populated area and almost entirely within the City or Burbank.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.821" offset="262666">The problem with respect to this airport began in approximately 1965 when jet aircraft began using this airport on a regular basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.989" offset="315329">As jet traffic increased, the problem became more serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.186" offset="340093">The problem was first officially noted by the FAA Tower Chief of this in 1967 when he issued the first of a series of four runway abatement preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.112" offset="427865">He noted at the time that the problem in the vicinity of airports had become increasingly serious and that if the problem could not be resolved, it might be necessary to close runways and even entire airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.914" offset="515009">After this, he issued three other indifferent runway preference orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.773" offset="542490">None of these provided any substantial relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.801" offset="566627">The last of these orders was issued in September of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.218" offset="592227">Thereafter, the Council of the City of Burbank took the matter in hand and in March of 1970, adopted the ordinance which is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.491" offset="653354">The ordinance makes it unlawful for the operator of the Hollywood Burbank Airport to allow a pure jet aircraft to take off between the hours of 11 p.m. and 7 a.m., except in emergencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.951" offset="727228">The same prohibition is applied to the pilots of these aircrafts.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.344" offset="752724">As noted by the Court of Appeals in its decision, the expressed purpose of the ordinance was to abate the serious environmental problem caused by the taking off of jet aircraft during sleeping hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.598" offset="833808">As found by the Trial Court, the ordinance interfered with one Sunday night intrastate flight, and with flights of jet aircraft of at least three per week.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.362" offset="904861">Some of those who had filed their briefs in this case have mistakenly used a figure of 60 per month as a number of corporate jet flights interfered with by the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.221" offset="960240">This is the -- this number 60 is a total number of jet -- corporate jet aircraft flights during nighttime hours, as testified too by the President of Lockheed.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.929" offset="1019068">He was unable to state how many of these flights occurred during the proscribed hours.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="235.584" offset="1045713">Well, it’d be a little more difficult to predict the pattern of private aircraft, would it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_l_sieg_jr" startTime="242.584" stopTime="253.533">
            <label>Mr. Richard L. Sieg, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="242.584" offset="1073716">Yes, Your Honor, it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.847" offset="1082807">I assume it was irregular, but the plaintiffs in this case did not go into that in any detail.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="253.533" stopTime="256.991">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="253.533" offset="1117497">When you say nighttime, do you mean sunset to sunrise?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_l_sieg_jr" startTime="256.991" stopTime="773.569">
            <label>Mr. Richard L. Sieg, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="256.991" offset="1131290">Yes, the testimony as it found in the record refers to the fact that 60 aircrafts, corporate jet aircraft, took off during the nighttime hours, and that word was specifically used, and I followed that answer with a question as to how many of these occurred during the proscribed hours and the President of Lockheed was unable to state how many.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.798" offset="1238601">He first said maybe half and then he had to state that he couldn’t testify to that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.380" offset="1288861">May I continue, Your Honor?</text>
            <text syncTime="299.059" offset="1299623">The evidence in this case established that airports, whether publicly or privately owned, had not been brought into the orbit of federal control with one exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.383" offset="1364929">The exception is found in Section 612 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, which was adopted in 1970 and became effective after the trial of this case on May 27, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.326" offset="1448626">That section is very peculiarly worded.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.103" offset="1467747">It provides that any person who desires to serve air carriers, the word “desires” is used in the section, air carriers certificated by the Civil Aeronautics Board may apply for an airport operating certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.865" offset="1554787">The section further provides that the Federal Aviation Administrator must issue such a certificate if he finds that the person is able to conduct a safe operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.937" offset="1611107">That is all.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.167" offset="1619989">The administrator may attach conditions to these certificates that further this particular end, that is, a safe operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.966" offset="1667218">Section 611 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, which played a prominent part in this case, was added in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.451" offset="1729181">It confers on the Federal Aviation Administrator the power to issue such rules and regulations as he may find necessary to provide for the control and abatement of aircraft noise and sonic boom.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.381" offset="1812877">If this section conferred on the Administrator the power to regulate airports in terms of noise, he has specifically refrained from so doing and has repeatedly affirmed the freedom of airport proprietors to exclude aircraft from their airports on the basis of noise considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.898" offset="1923009">The District Court, in its decision, held the ordinance to be invalid on the ground of preemption, conflict, and the unreasonable burden which the ordinance would have if it were applied to all major airports throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.020" offset="2015483">The Court of Appeals, in its decision, did not reach the Commerce Clause issue and restricted its decision to the Supremacy Clause matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.050" offset="2071594">It held, the ordinance to be repugnant to the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution on the ground of preemption and also on the ground of conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.100" offset="2131780">The conflict issue, it cited, at last of the FAA Tower Chief’s noise abatement runway procedures and also the fact that the ordinance interfered with the Sunday night intrastate flight of PSA.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.953" offset="2215163">The Court of Appeals broadly held in its decision that the pervasiveness of the federal regulation in the field of air commerce, the national interest in such regulation, and the nature of air commerce itself precluded states and local governments from enacting this type of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.720" offset="2366255">The District Court in its decision, holding that the ordinance had to be viewed in the aspect as if it were applied to all major airports in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.937" offset="2427068">It was a holding along with the broad holding of the Court of Appeals which made it necessary that we apply to this Court for hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.854" offset="2482761">The ordinance comes before this Court with the presumption that it was reasonable and necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.108" offset="2511809">The evidence introduced by the plaintiffs in this case demonstrated the airport’s inadequacies.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.621" offset="2545873">The airport is simply not operable without being used of adjacent private property for its approach ways and its takeoffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.411" offset="2589027">Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals specifically noted the seriousness of the problem that the airport created to those that resided in its vicinity.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.590" offset="2637720">This problem was further underscored by the various statements made by the FAA Tower Chief in these various noise abatement runway procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.417" offset="2681083">He stated, for example, that the area within 5 miles of the airport was noise sensitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.698" offset="2706160">He made further reference to the numerous complaints, the possible result of requiring the closing down of runways and entire airports.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.886" offset="2766869">This brings me to the point that I would like to elaborate on.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.225" offset="2792260">It is against the background that I’ve just stated that we asserted in our brief that the Commerce Clause cannot shield those who invade Fifth Amendment Rights, and that legislation, such as the Burbank ordinance, must be sustained if that amendment is to have any real meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.632" offset="2889853">We pursue this especially in view of this Court’s recent decision in Roe versus Wade.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.665" offset="2922036">By that decision, it is now firmly established that a right of privacy exists notwithstanding the fact that there is no specific mention of this right in the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.879" offset="2990895">As we understand the Court’s opinion, this fundamental right is founded on the Fourteenth Amendment’s concept of personal liberty and restriction on state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.010" offset="3051395">If this be so, then the same right of privacy must exist under the Fifth Amendment as a restriction on the powers of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.415" offset="3109073">This decision along with Griswold versus Connecticut, in our view, gives form and substance to the belief of the signers of the Declaration of Independence that certain unalienable rights existed, including the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="773.569" offset="3197680">Mr. Sieg, that right of privacy, if it was mentioned in those cases, was a right against governmental action, weren’t they?</text>
            <text syncTime="785.278" offset="3244492">Where an airplane takes off owned by a private carrier, that’s not the government invading anybody’s right of privacy, is it?</text>

            <text syncTime="799.036" offset="3299558">If the decision of the Court of Appeals and the District Court in this case is correct in holding that the Federal Government has preempted the rights of states and local governments and the people from doing something about this invasion into their right of privacy, then we feel that this particular decision is most important and is applicable as against the Federal Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1159.265" offset="4740472">It is valid anyway on the grounds that we’ve argued in our brief that there is no federal preemption, no conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.567" offset="4773595">But, as we view the matter, there are able to-- the rights reserved to the people can be protected by any level of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.367" offset="4824795">It’s not in the exclusive power of the Federal Government to protect those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.284" offset="4844544">The people have many means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.961" offset="4851231">The Courts, of course, are the primary right, and the primary method, at least in this century, of indicating fundamental rights, especially civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.911" offset="4895013">We’re dealing in this case with human rights, and we need some rule that allows action by the people trough whatever governmental body will listen to them to protect these rights reasonably.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.256" offset="4972440">We do not contend in this case that the fundamental right of privacy involved here is absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.878" offset="5014862">We say that the right has to be viewed in terms of its effect, and there has to be a balancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.100" offset="5063764">That is, that the people is entitled to all reasonable and necessary protection, not absolute protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.118" offset="5107858">The balancing that we feel is proper is somewhat along the lines suggested in Southern Pacific versus Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.143" offset="5155924">The extent of the intrusion should be weighed against the effect on interstate commerce, and if the enactment, the ordinance, or the state law, or whatever it may be provides substantial and necessary relief, it should have a greater weight in the balancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.555" offset="5281625">I might add that the Court may recall, and again I’m striking at this Doctrine of Preemption and Conflict, but the first four-- the first two of the grievances that are set forth in the Declaration of Independence against the King of Great Britain were these two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.538" offset="5377546">He has refused his assent to loss the most wholesome and most necessary for the public good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.694" offset="5410147">He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance unless suspended on their operation ‘til his assent should be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.728" offset="5470333">The similarity between these grievances and the grievances that are set forth in the declarations of preemption contained in the more recent congressional enactments, especially the Noise Control Act of 1972, are worthy of note.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.818" offset="5586631">We submit, as a proposition worthy of this Court’s consideration, that a congressional declaration of preemption cannot be considered a rightful exercise of legislative authority where, in that effect, is to leave fundamental rights of the people unprotected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.920" offset="5691016">What we’re really saying is the application here of the dormant and unexercised power rule that is set forth in Head and Colorado Anti-Discrimination Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.349" offset="5764786">Even though there is expressed or implied congressional declaration of preemption, the country has to have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.715" offset="5818284">When you observe that for more than 10 years, some-7 odd million people of the United States has had to bear the burden of air commerce with the only remedy afforded, if you can call it a remedy, is a right to seek damages, if they own the property on which they reside, as against the airport proprietor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.030" offset="5947538">This, to us, is contrary to the fundamental rights guaranteed by the federal constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.606" offset="5997798">We equally feel that the time has come for the Courts to take a direct hand in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.153" offset="6052028">The Solicitor General affirms in his brief, and I assume he will argue accordingly, that states and local governments, whether they are proprietors or non-proprietors, can enact reasonable regulations to control the noise problem in connection with airports within their jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.395" offset="6144920">But, suppose the governmental entity, having jurisdiction, refuses or fails to give the residents in their vicinity appropriate and necessary relief, only the Courts are then available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.910" offset="6222973">It seems to us that the problem has escalated to such a point that the lower Federal Courts should take a hand in the matter and, if necessary, require from these airport proprietors the summation of plans which will eventually reduce the problem of noise to levels which the people can stand.</text>

            <text syncTime="1608.123" offset="6535816">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.379" offset="6548877">I’ll first discuss the applicability of the National Environmental Policy Act, the Environmental Quality Improvement Act, and the Noise Control Act, and then apply them to the facts of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.638" offset="6597883">Together, these establish a national policy of preservation of the environment in general and of the reduction of noise pollution in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.313" offset="6640619">And, this policy has been relegated by the appellees the obscurity of a footnote on page 67 of their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.212" offset="6672175">It deserves more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.441" offset="6681161">Their rationale is that given by the Ninth Circuit, that given the generality of a national policy, it must yield to the more specific activities of the Federal Regulatory Agency and the authorizing statute in the field of aviation, and that contention quite simply is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.086" offset="6767679">It was the purpose of Congress in enacting the National Environmental Policy Act to, rather than pour through the statutes the codes one by one and amend the authorizing bill for each specific single-purpose agency board or commission, to amend them all in one stroke, and it did that with the enactment of NEPA, the National Environmental Policy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.642" offset="6877915">And, in the words of Senator Jackson, the bill’s author on the Floor in explaining the bill, this constitutes the statutory enlargement of the responsibilities and concerns of all instrumentalities of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.776" offset="6938520">What portions then of the National Environmental Policy Act are applicable?</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.090" offset="6955760">Section 101 declares the policy, but Congress wasn’t content with a mere declaration of policy least it’d be considered merely hortatory and something not to be adhered to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.518" offset="7013439">It inserted three devices which Senator Jackson, on the Floor in explaining the bill, referred to as “action forcing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.705" offset="7046144">Now, of these three, the one with which people are most familiar of is of course, first, the environmental impact statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.699" offset="7082193">Secondly, the requirement that there’d be consultations with experts in comment and, third, is the one which Senator Jackson put first and which is the one which is most pertinent to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.676" offset="7146036">As he explained it on the Senate Floor, “to ensure that the policies and goals defined in this Act are infused into the ongoing programs and actions of the Federal Government.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.297" offset="7192534">The Act also establishes some important action forcing procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.147" offset="7211969">Section 102 authorizes and directs all federal agencies to the fullest extent possible to administer their existing laws and regulations in conformance with the policies set forth in this Act, and that essential wording then appears in Section 102 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.110" offset="7287829">Three months later, Congress passed the Environmental Quality Improvement Act, and in that Act it reiterated the national policy and, secondly, it said that the primary responsibility for implementing that national policy laid on-- rested with the state and local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.277" offset="7356479">And, finally, we get to the Noise Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.821" offset="7366614">There are four sections of that that I want to talk about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.158" offset="7379989">First, Section 2 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.331" offset="7388662">Congress declared there was a policy of preserving an environment for all Americans free from noise that jeopardizes their health or welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.116" offset="7435786">Next is Section 4 (a), and that says that every federal agency must adhere to the policy which I previously outlined in Section 2 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.631" offset="7481866">Now, the appellees in their argument, again in a footnote, say that this means only that the FAA must balance environmental considerations with the considerations of aviation which is, in a sense, a truism but it also reduces the Act to nothing because that was a preexisting obligation, at least since the enactment of NEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.427" offset="7573086">The third section I want to refer to is I think the most important one, Section 4 (b), which says the federal agencies must comply with state and local noise requirements for the control of noise to the same extent that any person is subject to that requirement and the appellees, this time in half of footnote, dismissed that by saying that the statement assumes the validity of a local ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.637" offset="7681964">Well, of course that’s true, but that misses the entire point of what Congress was trying to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.772" offset="7706415">Congress has made the local ordinance valid by enacting Section 4 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.596" offset="7729716">Until that time, any time the state or local government tried to regulate noise against a federal entity, somebody would come in and say “Supremacy Clause, you can’t do that” and Congress, by enacting 4 (b) has reversed that and has said “it is valid, you can do that unless the specific measures prescribed in Section 4 (b) for the President to exempt a particular activity are affirmatively undertaken by the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.297" offset="7856567">Right--</text>

            <text syncTime="1966.149" offset="7967953">In this particular case, were it not for a federal activity within the area, which -- activities such as the FAA purporting by its runway preference order to take action which would invalidate a local ordinance, if not for that the local ordinance would be valid and Congress is now stepping in and saying we’ve got to obey -- the Federal Government has to obey the local ordinance unless there’s affirmative action by the President.</text>

            <text syncTime="2033.056" offset="8235551">One perhaps to which I was addressing myself with more the conflict aspect and you’ve been addressing yourself more to the aspect of preemption, and it is my contention that preemption may no longer be envisioned as it has in the past solely as a question of taking one statutory scheme that preexisted the various environmental Acts and, looking at that alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.768" offset="8346415">It becomes a question of defining what you mean by the field alleged to be preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.252" offset="8368358">I suppose the aviation purists will say “Well, it’s the field of aviation”, and you look at all the Federal Government has done in this area in the unitary control and so on, and the environmental purists will say “Well, it’s a field of noise.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.011" offset="8431365">This is a state and local matter, and you’ve got to have one authority, a unitary control all over that because if you control some noise sources but not other noise sources, you haven’t gotten anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.650" offset="8473997">Well, both of those really miss the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.233" offset="8484342">The point of this case is that neither a pure aviation case nor a pure noise case, but it’s a case which involves the interrelationship of the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.923" offset="8523107">And, here, I think it’s important to get into just what has happened in the field of the regulation of aircraft noise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.147" offset="8567933">Is there, to use the California Supreme Court’s words in Loma Portal, what is described as a lacuna in the federal regulatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.010" offset="8607431">Let’s look at the possibilities for regulation of aircraft and airport noise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.282" offset="8632508">You look at land use, sighting, compatible zoning around an airport, Federal Governments do nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.569" offset="8661661">You look at single-event noise limit such as we’ve heard the port authority of New York and New Jersey has been applying since the 1950s.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.386" offset="8692903">Federal Government has done nothing though, of course, New York has.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.357" offset="8708786">You look at the cumulative mechanism for watching the whole -- overall exposure to noise and reducing that, the system which we are now experimenting with in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.478" offset="8757269">Section 7 (a) 3 of the Noise Control Act says that that’s one of the matters that EPA has to study and to report back to Congress, and I know that they are watching the California experiment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.870" offset="8810872">You look at time limitations such as Burbank imposed, Santa Monica imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.136" offset="8831875">Again, the Federal Government has done nothing except at Washington National which it owns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.645" offset="8853922">You look at mandating the use of quieter airplanes, something Los Angeles has proposed on which the Federal Government has done nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.269" offset="8892479">You look at runway preference orders, there’s an area where the Federal Government has taken some steps, though we’ve learned from Port Authority against Eastern Airlines that that’s ultimately the responsibility of the proprietor rather than Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.013" offset="8951411">And noise-- finally, noise limitation on individual aircraft types, the so-called type certification of a new aircraft and, here, the Federal Government has done a little but not very much such that the legislative history of the Noise Control Act shows a letter from Senator Tunney to Senator Muskie to the effect that by 1975, 18.6%of the aircraft will have been controlled in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.321" offset="9068648">In other words, in the field of the regulation of aircraft and airport noise, taking both these fields together and meshing them, the Federal Government has just barely stepped onto the edge of that field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.848" offset="9122774">It’s in light of that that I think this matter must be viewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.403" offset="9145031">So, what statutes then are the statutes where-- which are applicable to this field?</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.774" offset="9170422">It’s not, as would’ve been the case five years ago, just the Federal Aviation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.365" offset="9192782">It is, instead, the Federal Aviation Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Environmental Quality Improvement Act, and the Noise Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.618" offset="9233847">It’s no longer enough just to view single-purpose regulatory statutes by themselves without reference to the more recent congressional enactments which are sort of reduced to congressional dicta by appellees’ views, sort of words in the form of statute but without the command of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.877" offset="9318902">So, we have these action forcing devices, that there is a national policy, that all branches shall enforce that national policy, that Congress has placed primary responsibility for that national policy upon state and local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.127" offset="9391835">With respect to noise in particular, Congress has said that absent a specific affirmative presidential exemption, federal agencies are bound by the state and local requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.131" offset="9435930">And, the City of Burbank has implemented that state -- that national policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.970" offset="9459231">So, what do we have?</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.066" offset="9463620">A national environmental policy which, of the three branches of government, the Legislative Branch is originated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.496" offset="9493400">The Executive Branch will, in a few moments, appear in support of as a friend of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.217" offset="9516283">We ask that the third branch of government, this Court, lend its support to the national environmental policy and make it whole.</text>

            <text syncTime="2623.040" offset="10595558">In both of the lower Courts in this case, a brief was filed on behalf of the Federal Aviation Administration taking the position that this ordinance was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.440" offset="10645086">The argument we made was that there was preemption of the subject of noise by the Federal Government, and this ordinance constituted an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.919" offset="10695032">The brief’s discussion of the Commerce Clause-- sorry, of the preemption point had almost no analysis of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.702" offset="10726170">It was discussed one or two places very briefly, a couple of quotations and references to committee reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.879" offset="10754905">Now, when this Court noted probable jurisdiction of this appeal, the Federal Government undertook a lengthy and detailed analysis of this case and of the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.518" offset="10801403">The Department of Transportation, in which the Federal Aviation Administration is a constituent agency, studied the case very carefully, and the Department of Justice itself both in the Civil Division and the Solicitor General’s Office studied the legislative history in depth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.934" offset="10875068">We went into the thing in great detail, and the unanimous conclusion of all of these people after this study was that the prior position we had taken on behalf of the Federal Aviation Administration in this case with respect to the preemption and Commerce Clause issues was erroneous and, accordingly, the United States has now filed a brief in this case and I am arguing here today, taking the position that the Burbank ordinance is valid.</text>

            <text syncTime="3431.047" offset="13827532">And if I may just refer to one other thing, Mr. Yost spoke about the Noise Control Act of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.454" offset="13865148">In addition to the general provisions dealing with noise, there’s a specific provision of that statute relating to aircraft noise, and one of the things that this statute did was to direct the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to make a study and report to commerce within nine months on a variety of topic relating to aircraft noise, one of which was additional measures available to airport operators and local governments to control airport noise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.582" offset="14021674">Such a study is now being made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.334" offset="14028675">Now, it seems to us, this very clearly indicates that the Congress that passed this law wanted to see what could be done by both the local operators and by the local governmental authorities to deal with aircraft noise, and it seems it would be rather anomalous, we think, for Congress on the one hand to have been requesting this additional information to see how we could implement the power in the local government agencies and, at the same time, in effect to be saying “but we’ve taken away from the local government authorities any power to deal with this.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.809" offset="14178617">We think the basic thrust of all of this legislative history is that there’s nothing in this Act to indicate that Congress ever intended at least until there’d been further action by the Federal Government, either the Congress or the FAA, to bar the local governmental authorities from dealing with this serious and difficult problem of noise, and that’s the way it stands and we think, on that basis, the Burbank ordinance has not been preempted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3612.409" offset="14553004">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.874" offset="14574843">The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 is the corner stone of the statutory scheme here involved, and I think we’ve come to the point in the argument where it would be worthwhile to stop for a minute and consider the high points of that Act, and the legislative history of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.653" offset="14653942">Enacting the 1958 Act, Congress responded to two fundamental and closely related defects in the prior statutory history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.428" offset="14693125">First, as the senate committee said about the 1958 Act, there had previously been a diffusion among many committees and boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.641" offset="14733981">Second, as the senate committee said, there was a lack of any clear authority in the statute for centralized airspace management.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.252" offset="14768358">By 1958, it’d become crucially necessary for Congress to do something about this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.745" offset="14790301">There’d been a vast increase in air traffic and, even by that early date, Congress recognized that the nation’s airspace was a diminishing and vital natural resource.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.833" offset="14842755">Now, to correct this splintering of authority, Congress vested the 1958 Act on questionable authority for all aspects of airspace management in the FAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.658" offset="14889984">Indeed, Congress went so far investing this plenary authority to say explicitly the administrator of the FAA should not be required to submit his decisions regarding airspace to any other organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.020" offset="14947453">In addition in this 1958 Act, Congress, and it’s important to recognize this, authorized the administrator to issue regulations for the efficient utilization of airspace, as well as for the safety of aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.970" offset="15003251">This dual purpose runs all through the statute, all through the actions of the administrator the purpose of achieving safety and the purpose of achieving safety and the purpose of having an efficient use of a navigable airspace.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.683" offset="15058108">Now, in the 1958 Act, Congress also gave the FAA authority to issue regulations for the protection of persons and property on the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.103" offset="15099800">The amicus brief for the United States vastly understates the importance of this provision asserting that the provision was only designed to provide protection from insecticides sprayed during crop dusting and saying that it was wholly unrelated to congressional consideration of the aircraft noise problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.884" offset="15178898">This is a demonstratively faulty reading of the legislative history and, unfortunately, this faulty premise infects the entire government’s argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.008" offset="15223411">The government has failed, in its characterization of this section, to note the statements in the 1962 hearings by Congressman Oren Harris, the long-time Chairman of the Commerce Committee and an architect of the 1958 Act who explicitly said that that provision of the 1958 Act was addressed to the problem of aircraft noise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.272" offset="15316511">He said that the problem of crop dusting was not to so reason for Congress’ enactment of that particular section but, rather, the section was in order to give broad rule making authority to the FAA in the field of aircraft noise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3819.546" offset="15381608">The government is also wrong as a matter of history in saying that the authority conferred by this section of the 1958 Act was used only at a few noise sensitive airports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.860" offset="15422777">The fact is, as CAV Chairman Boyd testified noise abatement runway patterns were established under this section at every major airport in the United States as early as 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.538" offset="15477530">By this 1958 Act, which is I say the corner stone and it has to be our beginning point here, Congress vested in the FAA plenary authority for airspace management and the regulation of aircraft operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.860" offset="15534791">Under this statutory authority of the administrator of the FAA has issued regulations which have been described as being a formidable proportions, impressive detail, and manifest sophistication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3871.160" offset="15587976">Now, to understand the scope of the breath of the federal control, I’d like to ask you to consider with me, as one of the witnesses did at the trial, the impact of federal regulation on a typical flight from Hollywood Burbank Airport to San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.656" offset="15661955">In the example I’m using here, I’ve chosen a flight from Hollywood Burbank to San Francisco because that’s the most frequent destination, but the scope of control would be the same if the flight had gone to Phoenix or on the Burbank-Seattle route or any other commercial flight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3907.037" offset="15731545">Perhaps I should begin the description of this imaginary flight by saying that each commercial aircraft on this route has an airworthiness certificate and it has a type certificate not-- covering not only the airframe and the engines, but every appliance on the aircraft, and each aircraft is flow in accordance with operation specifications which authorize its operation into and out of each airport that it serves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.015" offset="15843453">Furthermore, each pilot must have a pilot certificate and each flight engineer must be certificated by the FAA.</text>

            <text syncTime="3960.659" offset="15945958">The fundamental difference between that case and this, Your Honor, is that in that case the federal regulation was directed solely at safety on the seas and the waterways.</text>

            <text syncTime="3977.563" offset="16013667">Yes, Your Honor, but the FAA, under both the 1958 Act and the 1968 Act, is explicitly required to balance not only those interests, environmental interests as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.063" offset="16063613">As the Court of Appeals pointed out, the FAA has to take into account the multiple national interest involved: national defense, aviation, and environmental considerations, and that is a fundamental and basic distinction between this case and the Huron case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.805" offset="16126621">If I can continue on the imaginary flight to San Francisco, I think it’s important to know that long before this flight takes place, perhaps so much as 30 days, a flight plan would’ve been filed with the FAA or Traffic Control Center for Southern California, the center that’s responsible for managing all the airspace of Southern California which stores these flight plans in a computer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4028.597" offset="16217736">30 minutes before the flight takes place, the FAA Center electronically informs the FAA tower at Hollywood Burbank Airport of the anticipated flight so the tower can be ready to give the necessary clearances to the pilot, whether the pilot gets his clearance will depend upon conditions of the navigable airspace.</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.631" offset="16297880">These conditions are frequently abnormal or subnormal depending on matters such as weather, congestion, terminal repairs, and accidents or a combination of those factors, and when this happens, the FAA Control Center for Southern California may tell the FAA Tower at Hollywood Burbank to hold that aircraft on the ground or to modify the departure in some respect.</text>

            <text syncTime="4107.872" offset="16534862">The runway which is assigned will be the result of a number of factors including federal noise abatement procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="4115.488" offset="16565373">After taxing to the designated runway, the pilot must get a further clearance for takeoff from the FAA tower.</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.852" offset="16594735">I think it’s important for our purposes to notice that before a plane can take off into the navigable airspace, it has to be cleared by the FAA tower.</text>
            <text syncTime="4132.438" offset="16633083">The FAA tower acts as a control valve regulating access to the navigable airspace.</text>
            <text syncTime="4138.828" offset="16658683">After takeoff, the airplane is monitored, directed, supervised very closely by the Hollywood Burbank Tower as long as it’s within the tower’s airspace and it’s transferred to the Center for Southern California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4153.774" offset="16718451">About halfway to San Francisco, it’s passed off to the Oakland Center which, indeed, then monitors it with great care and precision, until it’s in the vicinity of the San Francisco Airport and then the FAA tower at San Francisco guides it down into landing and, once again, into the taxiing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.318" offset="16796609">It’s by no means a high privilege to say that every aspect of this flight, from the planning for it as much as 30 days ahead, the entry into navigable airspace and everyday detail of the execution of the flight is supervised by the Federal Airspace manager, the FAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.194" offset="16864110">Now, it’s our basic position which I’ll be reiterating here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4195.500" offset="16885321">If there are to be restrictions imposed on the entry into the navigable airspace, they should come from the federal agency which has been authorized by the Congress to weight the national interest involved and determine whether or not those restrictions should be imposed.</text>

            <text syncTime="4239.445" offset="17061177">That power, being based upon ancient property concepts, would no doubt depend somewhat on the law of each state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4248.122" offset="17095868">But, beyond that, I would want to say that although the question is not here, there would be important barriers at several levels to that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4256.586" offset="17129723">First, there might be constitutional barriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4258.914" offset="17139022">Such a curfew might well involve an abridgment of rights under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4265.416" offset="17165040">Second, such a proposal might well be in conflict with federal law in some respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4270.775" offset="17186461">And, finally, I think that it’s worthwhile saying that there may be contractual provisions that would prevent the establishment of such a curfew by the proprietor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4280.035" offset="17223555">That question is not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4281.680" offset="17230137">Unquestionably, the proprietor has been saved from the full scope of the preemption under the 1968 Act of what the scope of the proprietor’s rights are as not yet determined.</text>

            <text syncTime="4318.151" offset="17376005">Well, the private airport would be in substantially the same situation as other public airports, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4326.179" offset="17408084">If they had established service and if the ending of that service would involve a violation of Commerce Clause, I can see the possibility of insistence on the continuation of that service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4340.864" offset="17466807">There’s no question, but once a private airport undertakes to begin to serve the public, it has obligations it may continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4349.928" offset="17503065">That would be particularly true if that private airport had received federal funds for control tower and other navigational equipment, but not for its runways.</text>
            <text syncTime="4363.025" offset="17555519">As I move forward in this preemption argument, I think it’s very significant to me that the United States concedes in its brief that airspace management is an exclusively federal responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="4378.492" offset="17617377">In our view, and we believe in the view of Congress, airspace management is a comprehensive and invisible concept which includes all regulation of the use of navigable airspace.</text>
            <text syncTime="4390.346" offset="17664711">Any entity we say which regulates the hours that air traffic may flow into the navigable airspace is inevitably involved in airspace management.</text>
            <text syncTime="4400.248" offset="17704312">To allow local entities to regulate this flow would, we say, fractionalize airspace management and direct our position to the congressional purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4409.788" offset="17742555">A curfew acts as a blockade on traffic in a manner which we think is sharply inconsistent with the efficient operation of the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4419.218" offset="17780276">We all know that the congestion with its attendant threats to safety and efficiency is one of the principle problems of our transportation system, yet curfew not only increase congestion but they aggravate it in the hours on the shoulders of the curfews where the congestion is already the worst.</text>
            <text syncTime="4435.945" offset="17847150">Those are particularly the hours between 6 and 10 in the evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="4440.431" offset="17865122">The adverse effects of a curfew are greatly aggravated, greatly multiplied in a country as broad as ours where the impact is spread over six time zones unless magnified because of the effect of the time zones on scheduling.</text>
            <text syncTime="4457.410" offset="17933040">Once again, to come back to the central point, restrictions so severe and debilitating to the system as a curfew and, as we believe a curfew to be, should be imposed, if at all, only by the agency entrusted by Congress with overall airspace management.</text>

            <text syncTime="4879.440" offset="19621177">Now, at page 67 of that grey brief, I think it’s quite significant to look at the sentence in the middle of the page where, once again, the Department of Transportation was telling Congress, this time the other House of Congress, as a practical matter and as ATA concedes in its testimony that only regulatory authority left to local communities or airport operators is the authority of the airport operator in the exercise of its proprietary function to limit on noise grounds the kind of aircraft which may use its facility.</text>

            <text syncTime="5067.252" offset="20372355">Because the airport proprietor must bear the liability, Congress created this narrow exemption from federal preemption so that the proprietor could protect himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="5290.669" offset="21266056">Now, the briefs of our adversaries have a difficult time with this legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="5297.223" offset="21292283">The brief reflecting the views the Department of Transportation advised to discount on the ground that Congress did not focus on the distinction, which seems to me to be a very strange position for an agency which advanced the distinction and persuaded Congress to accept it to be taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="5313.540" offset="21357484">United States also argues that it would be bizarre to have the federal preemption apply only to a few private airports, but the fact is that the federal preemption operates with respect to all airports, both public and private, and it prevents the exercise of local police power to control aircraft operations at those airports whether they’re publicly owned or privately owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5338.819" offset="21458631">As I said to Mr. Justice Stewart, the situation very frequently exists that an airport owner must face the fact that he is in the jurisdiction of more than one entity and he may be in a jurisdiction of quite a different entity then his public body, the public body of which he is a member, and this situation exists all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="5368.332" offset="21576704">With respect to the Hollywood Burbank Airport, to pick up on a question from Mr. Justice Rehnquist, even that airport is subject to two jurisdictions: the City of Los Angeles and the City of Burbank, and they might well enact conflicting or inconsistent regulations which would have a very great potential for interference with the National Air Transportation System.</text>

            <text syncTime="5401.392" offset="21708988">It was an issue on which the Court of Appeals found itself unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="5408.004" offset="21735424">Now, the conflict arises here because, prior to the enactment of the Burbank ordinance, the FAA had focused on the subject of nighttime takeoffs and issued a noise abatement order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5419.724" offset="21782235">By this order, they established a certain runway as the noise abatement runway which was to be used between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.</text>
            <text syncTime="5428.782" offset="21818493">The Court of Appeals held that this order represented a considered determination by the FAA that the Burbank order is below the lowest practical minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="5441.141" offset="21867917">The Tower Chief had announced that the noise abatement procedures contained in this order were designed to reduce noise exposure to the lowest practical minimum and then the Court of Appeals followed that up by saying that the order represented a considered determination that the Burbank order was beneath the lowest practical minimum and then the Court of Appeals held that because this was so, the Burbank order interfered with the balance set by the FAA in accordance with the power vested in it by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5472.115" offset="21991842">Now, the United States attempts to attack this conflict holding by saying that the FAA order simply did not represent any consideration of a locally administered curfew.</text>
            <text syncTime="5482.679" offset="22034056">The government doesn’t offer any citation of authority for this simply did not consider statement and there is none.</text>
            <text syncTime="5489.562" offset="22061641">On the contrary, the district judge who heard the testimony of the Tower Chief and the other witnesses found that, in issuing the order, the FAA had taken in hand the subject of nighttime takeoffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5503.068" offset="22115662">We don’t need to guess about the views of the FAA with respect to this order, and their amicus briefs in the lower Court, the FAA cited, appended, and relied on this order which the Court of Appeals then found to be in conflict.</text>

            <text syncTime="5668.894" offset="22778964">What we are saying is that this is a question of power, not a question of whether there should be curfews but who has power to impose them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5676.691" offset="22810102">Now, our basic argument is that if curfews are to be imposed, they represent such a severe and debilitating affect on the National Air Transportation System that they should be imposed only by a centralized agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="5689.911" offset="22862973">Now, the City of Burbank attacks the conflict on one other ground I need to note.</text>
            <text syncTime="5695.055" offset="22883558">Burbank claims that the procedures set forth in this FAA order are non-mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="5700.841" offset="22906755">The record, however, is to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5702.821" offset="22914696">The record shows the procedures became mandatory through incorporation into the aircraft’s clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5710.853" offset="22946774">Thus, the district judge explicitly found that the preferential runway assignment is incorporated to the aircraft’s clearance as an instruction to the pilot.</text>
            <text syncTime="5719.934" offset="22983137">If the pilot violates this instruction, he becomes subject to a civil penalty and he may become subject to revocation of his license.</text>
            <text syncTime="5728.620" offset="23017827">Testimony in Trial Court showed that this runway procedure which was embodied in the FAA order was followed except on a few occasions when the tower itself permitted a deviation because of weather or other operating conditions affecting safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="5744.834" offset="23082715">So the net of the matter, as we see it, is the FAA order is a considered determination regarding nighttime takeoffs by the agency empowered to do so and, therefore, is in conflict with the Burbank ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5763.234" offset="23156276">The remaining time, I at least, as far as my portion of the argument go, I’d like to discuss the commerce issues which seem to me to have been perhaps not adequately attended to up to this point, certainly not by me.</text>
            <text syncTime="5778.793" offset="23218552">The Commerce Clause has two separate and independent aspects, and I think they both deserve a great deal of consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="5785.446" offset="23245197">The first aspect relates to the holding of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5788.740" offset="23258363">The Burbank ordinance operates in an area where regulation must be prescribed by a single authority and, therefore, the Commerce Clause standing alone invalidates the ordinance under the rule laid down in Southern Pacific versus Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="5806.490" offset="23329311">The test under this phase of the Commerce Clause is not whether regulations at each airport must be precisely the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="5814.468" offset="23361285">We recognize, as I was saying a minute ago, that different airports would require different treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5820.362" offset="23384795">The test is whether regulation should come, in this instance, from a single authority, and we say that it must because of the volume of air commerce, the speed in which it’s conducted, and the technical complexity of airline scheduling and aircraft maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5836.877" offset="23450833">Only through the uniform application of a national policy, through centralized control by a federal agency can we properly cope with issue in the form of transportation.</text>

            <text syncTime="5850.027" offset="23503496">Your argument basically relies on the inevitable interrelationship of the airports around the country because of speed and time and you suddenly can’t takeoff from the west coast then it can’t takeoff from somewhere else during the daytime, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5868.268" offset="23576430">Is that it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Warren Christopher</label>
            <text syncTime="5871.336" offset="23588760">Basic interrelationship, and we say that that is a reason independent of burden-- independent of a burden analysis for holding here that the Commerce Clause requires that these restrictions be imposed, if at all, by a centralized authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5886.552" offset="23649573">Now, the national character of the system which Justice Stewart was just referring to is demonstrated very clearly by the FAA’s flow control system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5895.849" offset="23686771">Flow control involves the metering of aircrafts so as to cope with congestion or weather or other impediments to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5905.052" offset="23723551">Now, this flow control, as I illustrated in my imaginary trip, may involve holding aircraft on the ground at various airports.</text>
            <text syncTime="5913.965" offset="23759182">It may involve establishing a special separation between them in a navigable airspace.</text>
            <text syncTime="5920.041" offset="23783528">The flow control was initiated by the FAA in 1969 and, at that time, they made it the responsibility of the FAA Center in each one of the regions of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="5931.104" offset="23827832">However, only a few months after flow control was put in by the FAA, the FAA found it essential to establish a centralized flow control center in Washington D.C. to provide coordination of these flow control decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5945.420" offset="23885093">The FAA found that none of the regional centers had enough information to make wise decisions for the system as a whole, and I would say and emphasize that if national coordination is necessary for the flow control, it is vastly more necessary for such a lasting restriction of airports as would be a night curfew.</text>
            <text syncTime="5967.414" offset="23973073">I find it very interesting that in 1971 the Department of Transportation took almost precisely the same position with respect to the commerce issue, as I’ve been asserting here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5978.120" offset="24015809">This position was taken on a brief filed in the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts and, with your permission, I’ll read just one or two sentences from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5985.694" offset="24046111">Air transportation said to DOT, perhaps more than any other form of commerce requires regulation by a single authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5993.135" offset="24075891">Even before 600-mile per hour flights became the custom, Congress recognized this need by the establishment of the Federal Aviation Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="6002.295" offset="24112567">And to continue this sentence from the DOT’s brief, it would indeed be a harmful and regressive step to admit a compromise of the FAA’s authority to permitting the enforcement of local laws or regulations regarding the use of navigable airspace.</text>
            <text syncTime="6018.390" offset="24176933">This brief filed by the DOT in the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts is quoted in full in the answering brief of the Port of New York Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="6028.971" offset="24219251">Now, I certainly don’t challenge the right of the government to change its position in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6035.615" offset="24245791">I have no criticism of it, but I hope it won’t be improper for me to say it seems to me they were right the first time.</text>

            <text syncTime="6068.743" offset="24378389">Now, the net of this first argument under the Commerce Clause is our view that independent of other aspects of the discussion today, independent of preemption, independent of conflict, independent of the burden aspect of the Commerce Clause that, under Southern Pacific versus Arizona, the Court should find that air commerce, because of its speed and complexity, requires centralized management.</text>
            <text syncTime="6100.714" offset="24506180">The other aspect of the commerce argument involves the holding of the District Court that local ordinances would constitute and unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="6109.319" offset="24540662">This is the burden issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="6112.505" offset="24553409">The decisions of this Court teach us that an ordinance such as Burbanks cannot be considered as an isolated phenomenon, but must be weighed and tested as if imposed on a national basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6124.873" offset="24602833">This rule has been uniformly applied, I believe, in decisions of this Court and it’s especially appropriate, as this Court has said, where the restriction might interfere with the efficient use of the channels of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="6137.023" offset="24651421">For instance, in the Southern Pacific case, the Court said that it had to consider the consequences if all 50 states had sought to regulate train lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="6146.768" offset="24690395">Similarly, in Hood &amp; Sons versus Du Mond, this Court considered the effect on commerce if other states were to have adopted regulations comparable to those of the State of New York in the Milk Industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="6161.531" offset="24749537">In this particular case, the importance of considering local curfews on a national basis is emphasized by the finding of the District Court that, if upheld here, curfews will proliferate and be adopted by virtually all cities surrounding airports.</text>
            <text syncTime="6177.704" offset="24814216">It’s a very, very contagious business.</text>
            <text syncTime="6180.088" offset="24823724">Several witnesses have testified to this contagious character of the curfews and there seems little doubt that many cities, as reported in the press, are watching the outcome of this litigation and will enact curfews if they are upheld here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6194.857" offset="24882761">Now, the government takes a rather unusual position that the nationwide effects of a restriction on commerce might be appropriate in some cases, but is not appropriate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6207.617" offset="24933857">I think this an assertion on their part that some support it and I find no support for it in the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6214.826" offset="24962696">Moreover, the government even reveals some doubt about its own theory when it says in a footnote that it would be appropriate to consider a curfew in relation to existing curfews when weighing it under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="6230.197" offset="25024136">I think you’ll soon see that this is an extraordinary theory which produced very extraordinary results.</text>
            <text syncTime="6235.985" offset="25047333">Presumably, the footnote means that, at some point, a proliferation of curfews could result in a violation of the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="6243.513" offset="25077426">Does that mean if there are10 curfews creating a violation of all 10 are invalid, or does it mean the 10th one is invalid and the first ones are valid, thus, creating a race to the City Council to see who can get there first or does it mean, on the other hand, that the 10th one makes the 1st one invalid but the 10th one continues to be valid itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6267.276" offset="25172511">Well, I think you can see that the irrationality of the results from such a test confirms the wisdom of this Court’s longstanding rule that restrictions on commerce should be judged as if applied nationally.</text>

            <text syncTime="6329.978" offset="25423287">Because over 48% of the airmail moves at night, a curfew would delay not millions but billions of pieces of mail at least one day, a delay which is certainly in sure of conflict with our postal policy which says overnight transportation of letter mail is the primary goal of postal operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6348.930" offset="25499042">The effect of a night curfew on air cargo service would be equally drastic.</text>
            <text syncTime="6355.631" offset="25525896">42% of air cargo moves at night and, indeed the whole industry exists depending upon its ability to move cargo on an overnight basis from one part of the country to the other, and I think we can see that the imposition of curfews on a nationwide basis would have a severe hobbling effect if it wouldn’t completely destroy this growing air cargo industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="6446.731" offset="25890252">Now, I’d like to briefly recur to one or two of the points made earlier in the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="6456.710" offset="25930167">With respect to the National Environmental Policy Act, it seems to me that this Act is not at all consistent with the result below.</text>
            <text syncTime="6466.332" offset="25968724">That Act requires federal agencies to consider environmental matters in their decision making process, but it also explicitly provides Congress shall not exclude other essential considerations of national policy in determining what policy shall be imposed finally by the federal agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="6488.936" offset="26059107">It’s important to note that the National Environmental Policy Act, in a sense, duplicates the 1968 amendment with respect to aircraft noise.</text>
            <text syncTime="6497.053" offset="26091604">Under both NEPA and the 1968 amendment, the FAA must and does take into account environmental factors in its decision making, but neither this statute nor the other statute cited was intended to make environmental factors controlling over all other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="6516.089" offset="26167777">Similarly, I think it can be said that the Environmental Quality Improvement Act is not inconsistent with the result below nor is it a statement that stated state and local government shall have primary responsibility for implementing national environmental policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6531.846" offset="26230784">These general expressions of congressional intent can hardly overcome the special responsibilities which have been imposed upon federal agencies, in particular the FAA, by Congress in the 1958 Act, the 1962 Act, and again in the 1972 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6550.619" offset="26305808">There’s been a reference here also to the 1972 Noise Control Act, and I think I should briefly mention that the 1972 Act does nothing to alter the power relationships as they were-- existed prior to that Act and as they were imposed by the 1958 and 1968 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6570.376" offset="26384906">In the 1972 Act, Congress reaffirmed its intention to the look-- to the FAA for rulemaking in the noise abatement field.</text>
            <text syncTime="6578.525" offset="26417507">The EPA, under that new Act, is called upon to use its expertise to recommend regulations, but authority to issue the regulations is retained in the FAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="6589.596" offset="26461706">And in deciding what regulations to issue, that 1972 Act again directs the FAA to balance the multiple national interests involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6600.501" offset="26505383">Both the House and Senate report on the 1972 Act stressed that it was not intended to change the law with respect to the respective authorities of the local and state governments, the Federal Government, and the airport proprietors as they existed before.</text>
            <text syncTime="6616.491" offset="26569331">I confess to being somewhat puzzled by the assertion that this case is controlled by Roe versus Wade.</text>
            <text syncTime="6623.200" offset="26596185">Looking again at the slip opinion of that case, seems to me that, and the Court of course will be much more familiar with its holding than I am, there, a state statute had invaded a personal zone of privacy and was, therefore, struck down as unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="6640.708" offset="26666193">The Court held that the right to personal privacy includes the abortion decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6645.694" offset="26686151">It’s rather baffled to me as to how this can vindicate the ordinance before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6651.208" offset="26708198">Now, this case does not deal with any claim of invasion of personal rights as it deals with the validity of a local municipal ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6659.358" offset="26740799">If there’d been a Fifth Amendment taking or some other sort of a taking, the property owners might have brought an action, but that case has not been-- not here and has not been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="6668.540" offset="26777579">So, I could only express at least some puzzlement as to the effect of that particular argument on the issues before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6682.315" offset="26832645">There has been some discussion here also stressing that neither the statute nor the regulations involved specifically deal with curfews that they neither prevent them nor imposed them and, therefore, the locally imposed curfews must be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6700.365" offset="26904848">I think if we look back at the decisions of this Court, we’ll find that that argument is not borne out.</text>
            <text syncTime="6706.022" offset="26927417">The leading case on this point is Napier versus Atlantic Coastline, 272 US 605, where the Court held that it was without legal significance, I believe that was Mr. Justice Brandeis who held it was without legal significance that there was no explicit federal provision inconsistent with the local legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6723.170" offset="26996067">The Napier case itself, as the Court will remember, the Court struck down a state statute on automatic fire boxed doors for locomotives even though the ICC had not dealt with that subject.</text>

            <text syncTime="6745.450" offset="27085197">In every instance, you go back to what was the intention of Congress, did Congress intend to preempt the field and, were it hesitant to preempt the field, the fact that the administrative agency has not issued an explicit regulation on the subject involved does not prevent the subject involved from being held to be within the preempted area.</text>

            <text syncTime="6774.909" offset="27202957">Your Honor, I think if-- there was reliance in those cases, but it was reliance in order to try to eliminate the intention of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="6783.447" offset="27237125">The failure of Congress to touch a subject, of course, is the touchstone here and it’s what we’re-- what the whole discretion is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="6792.138" offset="27271920">I’d mentioned in passing also that the Napier case, followed by the Bethlehem Steel case in 330 US 767, once again the Court held that the failure of federal regulations to cover a particular subject matter did not mean that that subject matter was not within the preempted field.</text>
            <text syncTime="6811.019" offset="27347466">Coming to the conclusion of the argument here today, Your Honor, I would like to once again return to the question of airspace management which I think is central to this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6821.377" offset="27388844">It’s common ground at least between the appellees and the United States that airspace management is exclusively a federal responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="6829.477" offset="27421236">We say that any entity which controls the hours that aircraft can enter the navigable airspace is inevitably involved in airspace management.</text>
            <text syncTime="6837.527" offset="27453524">As we have seen, curfews have dramatically have adverse effect on the congestion problem on scheduling and on maintenance on the system as a whole, and we urge that restrictions which has a severe and adverse effects on transportation, air transportation particularly, should come from a centralized agency which have been entrusted by Congress with all aspects of airspace management</text>

            <text syncTime="6884.902" offset="27642964">I have five points I would like to make in those five minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6888.660" offset="27658010">The critical distinction, we think, that appears in this legislation in terms of what Congress was attempting to do here was between the regulation of flying, all aspects of flying which we think has been preempted by the federal legislation and the regulation of airports which is not the comprehensive regulation as a regulation of the airspace, a regulation of safety, a regulation of the flight of aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="6915.205" offset="27764172">But, we think it is not a regulation of the airport itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6919.102" offset="27779741">Now, of course, things that happen on the airport are related to flight.</text>
            <text syncTime="6923.446" offset="27797191">Obviously, if the airport refuses to build an additional runway that is necessary, it’s going to make it more difficult for flight to take place, but it is not the kind of thing we think that Congress was referring to when it keeps speaking in these terms, and I’d like to refer specifically to the letter from the Secretary at the appendix to the appellant’s brief which Mr. Christopher referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="6946.460" offset="27889246">What the Court’s letter said was the Courts have held that the fed--</text>

            <text syncTime="6951.858" offset="27910771">This is the first unnumbered page of the appendix after the green-blue slip at the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="6957.985" offset="27935326">The Courts have held that the Federal Government presently preempts the field of noise regulation insofar as it involved controlling the flight of aircraft, and then the next sentence they cite a case called the Town of Hempstead which was just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6972.831" offset="27994676">The Village of Hempstead attempted to control the flight of aircraft in and out of Kennedy Airport by saying that a plane could not fly over the Village of Hempstead if it emitted noise beyond a certain level.</text>
            <text syncTime="6985.636" offset="28045876">That’s what they were talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="6986.934" offset="28051101">We think it’s repeated again at the end of that paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="6989.406" offset="28061027">State and local governments will remain unable to use their police powers to control aircraft noise by regulating the flight of aircrafts and, of course, that’s precisely what the preferential runway regulation that’s involved in this case attempts to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="7004.068" offset="28119646">That controls the flight of aircraft.</text>

            <text syncTime="7032.751" offset="28234376">That-- But that, Mr. Chief Justice, is with reference to an ordinance that attempted to control the flight of aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="7040.223" offset="28264260">What Hampstead was attempting to do was to control the way in which planes landed and took off and approached the Kennedy Airport by saying planes which make more than a certain amount of noise cannot fly over our city and that’s, we think, what Congress had reference to when it spoke of controlling the flight of aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="7061.212" offset="28348270">And, we think the whole policy that’s reflected in this congressional debate and the FAA’s consideration of it is the recognition that when you’re dealing with such things as whether a plane should or shouldn’t be permitted to takeoff from an airport, that’s a matter of fundamental local policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="7076.839" offset="28410755">There are conflicting interests involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="7079.308" offset="28420577">On the one hand, the interests of the traveling public and the industry in the area of getting the best possible air service obtainable.</text>
            <text syncTime="7088.063" offset="28455581">On the other hand, there’s an equally strong, perhaps a greater, interest of the people, the interest of the people in these areas of being able to get a good night’s sleep.</text>
            <text syncTime="7096.594" offset="28489749">And, this is the kind of balancing of conveniences that traditionally is left to the local government bodies to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="7104.528" offset="28521514">The Town Council of Burbank made the judgment that whatever may be the effects of this on air service, and it seems quite clear it’s minimal here, that nevertheless that adverse effect was more than outweighed of a-- by the benefits to the people in this surrounding area of having freedom from the noise when they’re trying to sleep.</text>
            <text syncTime="7126.940" offset="28611166">Now, the runway preference order, I might add one other thing about it, that there is no authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="7132.024" offset="28631437">The FAA informs us and an air tower controller to impose a curfew.</text>
            <text syncTime="7136.928" offset="28651081">The only thing he can do is these preference runways.</text>
            <text syncTime="7139.641" offset="28661948">The preference runways are not mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="7144.186" offset="28680129">Page 444 of the record which contains the text of the pro-- the order, the second full sentence in that paragraph is saying the procedures are not mandatory on the part of the pilots. However, traffic controllers must be noise abate and conscious and emphasize noise abatement to obtain the highest degree of voluntary cooperation from pilots.</text>

            <text syncTime="7244.010" offset="29079385">That is, if I may restate it, as far as the federal regulatory scheme is concerned, the federal regulatory scheme does not operate to prevent an aircraft-- to prevent an airport from being told it cannot take-- permit certain noisy things at the airport as distinguished from the actual commencement of the flight.</text>

            <text syncTime="7285.740" offset="29246360">Under its broad power of interstate commerce, commerce could do it, either itself directly or Congress could do it acting through the FAA and maybe someday it will do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="7295.819" offset="29286693">Maybe a year from now, the FAA will conclude either that there should be a ban on curfews or decide to put in curfews.</text>
