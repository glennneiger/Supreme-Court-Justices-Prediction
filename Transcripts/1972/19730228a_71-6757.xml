            <label>Mr. Steven M. Umin</label>
            <text syncTime="66.466" offset="369246">I’ll do my best, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.402" offset="376978">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.043" offset="387532">This case here on writ of certiorari challenges the validity of a guilty plea, federal armed bank robbery, entered by the petitioner David X. Fontaine in Federal Court in November of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.996" offset="443329">The issues that the case raises were each presented pro se by Mr. Fontaine in his motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. 2255 and with the Court’s permission, I'll indulge in some oversimplification initially and define those issues as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.645" offset="517935">First, whether 2255 entitled the petitioner to an evidentiary hearing upon his concrete allegations which he had threw -- which show that his guilty plea was coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.321" offset="564642">And second and even more important, I would suggest, the threshold issue of whether petitioner’s guilty plea is void on the face of the existing record, without further evidentiary hearing, for want of a valid Sixth Amendment waiver of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.701" offset="630157">The procedural history of this case is the history of inattention to to detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.016" offset="647398">In the face of the petitioner’s concrete allegations, the police’s physical and mental abuse, United States Attorney declined even to answer those specific allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.118" offset="687835">The District Court nonetheless denied the petitioner’s claims summarily without a hearing, his waiver of counsel points on the ground that the petitioner had participated in a Rule 11 proceeding at guilty plea and his voluntariness claim on the same ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.606" offset="765785">The Court of Appeals typical of the inattention paid to this case, affirmed the summary denial below in one sentence and that sentence contained an error, an error dealing with the ground of decision by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.957" offset="823150">This Court granted certiorari and appointed counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.378" offset="836838">I mentioned the appointment only to highlight that the absence of counsel at all prior stages of this case and most particularly at the guilty plea itself is the critical fact at hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.553" offset="881560">From arrest through custody, through plea and sentencing, the absence of counsel raises the federal issue whether this record, the existing record made at the guilty plea, discloses a waiver of counsel compatible with the Sixth Amendment standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.505" offset="957419">The issue must be framed precisely.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.196" offset="968182">This is not a question of whether at a guilty plea proceeding there was an offer of counsel and a rejection of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.010" offset="995453">We can argue about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.331" offset="1000678">I do believe that the record shows something resembling an offer and something resembling a rejection.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.957" offset="1023248">But the question is whether even if there was a meaningful offer of counsel and an offer of reject -- and a rejection of counsel, the circumstances of that offer and rejection disclose an understanding and intelligent waiver under the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.008" offset="1091375">To quote from Carnley against Cochran, “In the absence of an understanding of an intelligent waiver anything less is not waiver.”</text>
            <text syncTime="256.190" offset="1128155">Let me say one word if I may about the position of that issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.302" offset="1144560">It stands as point number four in the petitioner’s brief on Page 47.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.477" offset="1165249">In my judgment and I would respectfully submit it to the Court, it’s point number one in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.295" offset="1184580">So, I’m something in the position of a college debater that I once heard who perhaps over-tied to the structure of his own argument, had to begin by announcing to his audience that I have four points to make, let me make the fourth one first.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.067" offset="1243617">The waiver of counsel point is indeed number four in the brief, but it’s number one the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.259" offset="1260440">Let me turn to the facts that surround the waiver of counsel point, making two things clear at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.216" offset="1288234">Absolutely nothing about that point depends upon the truth or falsity of the petitioner’s allegations pertaining to police abuse or coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.371" offset="1328880">Likewise, absolutely nothing about the waiver of counsel claim depends upon the Trial Court’s alleged compliance with the Rule 11 at the guilty plea proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.749" offset="1378408">The waiver of counsel point depends entirely upon the record made at that proceeding for it’s the record which must disclose whether there was not merely an offer and rejection of counsel but an understanding, an intelligent one.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.259" offset="1424384">It is the record to which Johnson against Zerbst, Carnley against Cochran and Boykin against Alabama refers.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.109" offset="1455835">That record shows that the petitioner was arrested on October 21, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.953" offset="1479137">That with the exception of a hospitalization he was in continuous custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.989" offset="1495333">It is un-denied on the record that he was never arraigned at which time he might have been informed of his right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.781" offset="1522500">Even those facts are strictly speaking irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.630" offset="1537860">The first fact which is critical is that during his custody, he signed two pieces of paper, alleged waivers of grand jury indictment and counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.116" offset="1587806">And on November 13, he came to Court in the company of United States Attorney without a lawyer and the plea proceeding took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.396" offset="1636916">I could read all of that proceeding to this Court in approximately four minutes at a reasonable pace.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.893" offset="1662934">Doubling the time, let’s assume that plea proceeding took eight minutes in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.178" offset="1688116">There is of course no time requirement on a guilty plea proceeding but I would submit that it is some index, the brevity of this proceeding is some index of the care and attention that was paid to the plea proceeding as a whole and to the question of the waiver of counsel, and I would read for you only that part of the proceeding which deals with the waiver of counsel, the very beginning of it and I’ll be very brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.364" offset="1788844">The United States Attorney on page 3 of the appendix, Mr. Chief Justice, the Assistant United States Attorney, Mr. Zanglin (ph) begins, “Your Honor, this is an arraignment on an information charging the defendant with armed bank robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.319" offset="1840671">He’s been given a copy of the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.690" offset="1850180">He acknowledges that he understands it and knows what the maximum penalty is.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.781" offset="1866480">I have explained to him his right to an indictment by a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.849" offset="1878810">He has waived that right and signed a waiver of rights form.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.164" offset="1892080">He understands that he has a right for an attorney at this time and informs me that he wants to waive that right and has signed the waiver of that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.815" offset="1922591">Knowing all of these rights, he informs me he intends to plead guilty of the information.”</text>
            <text syncTime="458.805" offset="1938578">The Court, “You are Mr. David Fontaine?”</text>
            <text syncTime="461.940" offset="1951117">Defendant Fontaine, “Yes sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="464.367" offset="1960835">The Court, “Did you ever receive the copy of the information here, the charge against you for armed bank robbery, is that right?”</text>
            <text syncTime="471.779" offset="1990510">Defendant Fontaine, “Right.”</text>
            <text syncTime="474.232" offset="2000332">The Court, “The first thing of consequence is that you have signed also a waiver of grand jury indictment which means you are entitled to have this matter first submitted to a grand jury and a determination made by that body and an indictment returned first.”</text>
            <text syncTime="488.663" offset="2058010">If the Court please, may I pause there to indicate that the trial court in accepting a plea first emphasizes the waiver of grand jury indictment out of court and then to the extent that it defines waiver at all defines it exactly erroneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.721" offset="2122271">A waiver of a grand jury indictment does not mean that you are entitled to have this matter first submitted to as grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.116" offset="2143796">It means exactly the opposite of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.751" offset="2154350">The Court then continues, “Do you understand that the rights you have there under?</text>
            <text syncTime="516.943" offset="2171173">Anyway, that’s what you will get if you wanted it to go to the grand jury.”</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="520.424" stopTime="525.949">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="520.424" offset="2185070">Don’t you think that cleared up whatever ambiguity troubled you about the first fact?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_m_umin" startTime="525.949" stopTime="797.136">
            <label>Mr. Steven M. Umin</label>
            <text syncTime="525.949" offset="2207117">I think not, Your Honor because all the Court does is ask the defendant, do you understand that and the rights you have there under?</text>
            <text syncTime="532.221" offset="2232299">If he understood that, that definition of waiver, he would be understanding precisely the opposite of what waiver was.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.024" offset="2259466">Anyway, the Court says, “That’s what you will get if you wanted it to go to the grand jury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="543.088" offset="2275767">Defendant Fontaine, “Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="545.302" offset="2284544">The Court, “You have signed a waiver of that right, am I right?”</text>
            <text syncTime="548.785" offset="2298546">Defendant Fontaine, “Yes, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="550.793" offset="2306591">There’s no indication by the Court at that time that the defendant was free at that point to reconsider his waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.517" offset="2329475">So, the whole issue of waiver introduced by the Trial Court without any suggestion that prior waivers made out of Court and in custody can be reconsidered and then the Court addresses the critical counsel point.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.031" offset="2379525">The Court, “In addition, you are entitled to be represented by an attorney And if you are without funds with which to employ an attorney, the Court will appoint one for you.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.538" offset="2417560">The Court has here before it a waiver of an assignment of an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.045" offset="2431561">Is it your wish to proceed here without an attorney?”</text>
            <text syncTime="584.760" offset="2442428">Defendant Fontaine, “I guess so.”</text>
            <text syncTime="587.818" offset="2454653">The Court, “You have got to know so.”</text>
            <text syncTime="590.603" offset="2465834">Defendant Fontaine, “Yes sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="594.704" offset="2482239">I would submit to this Court that that part of the plea proceeding which is all there is, on the question of the waiver of counsel is deficient in multiple respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.678" offset="2526124">First, there is no explanation at all in that part of the proceeding or anywhere else, as to what a guilty plea is, what rights it waives, and what right exists to plead not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.507" offset="2577429">Under Boykin against Alabama, a State case, but decided under federal constitutional standards, that alone is sufficient to condemn the plea and force vacation of this conviction, but there’s more.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.165" offset="2628002">The Court gave no explanation that a guilty plea does not entail the waiver of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.124" offset="2647855">Indeed the opposite impression is left by the Court’s indication that you have got to know that you want to waive counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.121" offset="2675858">I don’t suggest that’s the only implication to come out of that sentence, but it’s a fairly likely one.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.142" offset="2699891">And a layman is all too likely to consider a guilty plea as the equivalent of an abandonment of the lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.929" offset="2727058">The lawyer is useful for the fight for the time of trial, but if you’re going to plead guilty, you certainly don’t need a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.161" offset="2752031">And I suggest, in order to correct that impression, to make sure that an understanding and intelligent waiver of counsel takes place is the obligation of the Court accepting a guilty plea to indicate when a waiver of counsel is possible, is tendered that a guilty plea does not entail a waiver, nor of course is there any explanation of the role of counsel to guilty plea, of his critical role in plea bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.395" offset="2864985">This case does not indicate that any plea bargaining took place, indeed the sentence of 20 years with a maximum 25 suggest it didn’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.647" offset="2901974">And there were also lesser included offenses to federal law in bank robbery, which were never mentioned by the Court and which could be very vital indeed in plea bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.955" offset="2947218">The absence of any mention of lesser included offenses is, in my judgment, sufficient to condemn this plea under McCarthy against the United States where this Court did not quite hold that lesser included offenses had to be mentioned as part of the explanation to the defendant of the nature of the charge that was involved, but it strongly suggests in footnote 20 that where lesser included offenses are involved, the defendant cannot understand the nature of the charge without being told about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.967" offset="3063202">Boykin and McCarthy thus far condemn the plea, but there’s still more.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.780" offset="3086503">There is no statement by this Court that the Court thinks that counsel would be desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.869" offset="3106879">That a waiver of counsel is ordinarily not preferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.112" offset="3123806">Indeed as this Court has put it on many, many occasions, every presumption is indulged against waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.271" offset="3144495">The system really has no interest in an un-counseled guilty plea although it has an interest guilty pleas generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.047" offset="3175528">Nor when the petitioner indicated that he had guessed he did not want to proceed with a lawyer, did the Court take any concern or pains to clarify that ambiguous rejection to indicate at that point that he was offering a lawyer for this plea, to do anything at all to suggest to the defendant that this was not the time to guess about whether he wanted a lawyer or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.210" offset="3276257">If you’re in any doubt at all, the Court advices you to have one, instead --</text>

            <text syncTime="812.277" offset="3352430">I mean if he said, “You got to know so” that might mean to a defendant, in order to plead guilty, you got to know that you don’t want a lawyer which indeed would be the common sense interpretation that a layman might draw.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.389" offset="3396942">After all, I don’t need a lawyer to fight, I’m giving up, so I don’t need a lawyer. Or alternatively, it might have meant, I don’t want you to guess.</text>

            <text syncTime="878.195" offset="3616162">I suggest that when solemn occasion of a guilty plea is in front of the Court, there’s no room for ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.808" offset="3646568">I suggest that we hark back to the language of Mr. Justice Black in Johnson against Zerbst when he said that an attendant of un-counseled guilty plea presents to the Court an occasion for the protection of the Court, presents to the Court an occasion at which the Court has to take the greatest care that an un-counseled guilty plea is really the intelligent desire of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.355" offset="3736743">And a Court that would let the kind of colloquy that I’ve read, that is reflected on the circuit go by with the kind of ambiguities that ere in it, I suggest to you is not the sort of Court that has taken the kind of protection to see to it that the defendant understands what it means to have lawyer at a guilty plea and has then made a voluntary rejection of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.379" offset="3828903">The Government’s answers to these arguments consist of four.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.303" offset="3852622">That there was an offer and a rejection something that the petitioner does not challenge, although one could say that the offer wasn’t all that clear in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.843" offset="3894732">That the Court was offering a lawyer for his guilty plea proceeding and indeed that the rejection wasn’t all that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.306" offset="3924616">The Government says that the ambiguity may have been ambiguity in the rejection, I guess so, may have been cured by matters of tone of voice at the pleading and I don’t doubt that either.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.411" offset="3972995">But the question is not whether there was simply an offer and an equivocal rejection, although I suggest that this Court should require absolutely unequivocal waivers of a lawyer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1471.087" offset="5987767">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.846" offset="5990797">But no indication that that hospitalization in any way broke the custody or the chain of coercion which he alleges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.175" offset="6016084">It’s to that chain of coercion that I would now turn for the second point in the case which was featured in the petition for certiorari and may have been the reason for this Court’s grant of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.090" offset="6067702">That is petitioner’s contention that 2255, Title 28 of United States Code guarantees him an evidentiary hearing upon concrete allegations of coercion which he proved would show that his guilty plea was coerced unless, the files and records of the case conclusively show that he’s not entitled to such a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.917" offset="6162996">On this wing of the argument, let me make clear if I can what is not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.267" offset="6188492">It is not in dispute here that petitioner’s allegations are sufficient to show coercion to be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.359" offset="6208763">It is not in dispute that such allegations were traditionally heard in federal habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.414" offset="6229034">It is not in dispute that 2255 and its conclusively language was enacted against the background of the habeas corpus cases and carries forward the understanding of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.752" offset="6278353">The cases of Waley against Johnston and Walker against Johnson are conspicuously absent from the Government’s brief and that is because they stand for the proposition, later embodied in the conclusively language that a trial court on a 2255 motion save in cases of inherent incredibility, it has no credibility function to perform until it holds an evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.141" offset="6371976">Likewise, it is not in dispute that subsequent to the enactment of 2255, in Machibroda against the United States, in Sanders against the United States, this Court confirmed that save for cases of inherent incredibility, an evidentiary hearing must be held upon allegations which are sufficient to grant relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.551" offset="6445537">Nor is it in dispute that in Kaufman against United States, this Court applied Townsend in the same criteria to the question of when an evidentiary hearing should be held and indicated that those criteria were fully applicable under 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.202" offset="6508231">The Government’s arguments instead to justify the denial of the hearing in this case are two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.001" offset="6531427">First that by participating in the guilty plea proceeding, in alleged conformity with Rule 11 and I submit, Rule 11 was not complied with, the petitioner in effect forfeited his right to an evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.934" offset="6595062">That argument has two principal characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.234" offset="6604257">It’s an old one and it’s a bad one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.719" offset="6614288">It’s an old argument because it wasn’t advanced in substance in Waley against Johnston.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.106" offset="6635813">Waley who was represented against -- represented by counsel had a guilty plea, later alleged that he had been coerced to plead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.052" offset="6671548">But the Court of Appeals held that his participation of the plea proceeding with counsel, in effect, waived his right later to attack that plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.379" offset="6704880">The Solicitor General at that point confessed error and this Court held that if the coercion was sufficient to obtain the plea, it surely is sufficient to negate any suggestion that at a plea proceeding, the petitioner waived his right later to attack it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.946" offset="6767156">So, the first forfeiture argument is an old argument that this Court has already rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.552" offset="6789622">The second argument, it is likewise a poor argument I would suggest for a couple of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.398" offset="6816998">First, it ignores that petitioner in this case, although he did participate in a Rule 11 proceeding in which time he indicated that his plea was voluntary, has alleged that in fact, he was coerced to plea and the argument of the Government ignores that the coercion alleged applies not only to the guilty plead itself but the statements made thereafter, including the statement that the plea was voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.623" offset="6921906">The Government suggests that in certain circumstances, it maybe reasonable to suppose that a defendant would not raise the issue of coercion at a plea, but in such as where he has been told by a prosecutor not to reveal his promises to judge or his own lawyers such as Machibroda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.155" offset="6995989">But in the ordinary case, when a defendant participates in a plea, he should not later be allowed to attack the plea as involuntary if he didn’t object to voluntariness at the time of the plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.199" offset="7040188">First of all, this petitioner does tender the allegation that the police coercion extended not only to the plea itself but to the plea proceedings and so he has suggested a special reason for not having mentioned the voluntariness in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.249" offset="7108420">Moreover, however, the Government’s suggestion that participation of plea proceeding breaks the chain of coercion in effect and thus ensures that a statement of voluntariness at a plea proceeding is a valid one which cannot later be attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.315" offset="7176652">The Government’s suggestion that the chain of coercion has been broken by that kind of participation in the plea proceeding assumes the very question that an evidentiary hearing is designed to test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.378" offset="7224926">Whether in fact, there was any break in the chain of alleged coercion if coercion did in fact take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.689" offset="7250108">Whether the plea proceeding was effective in enabling the defendant to come forward and say, “No, Your Honor, I was coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.639" offset="7277902">It’s not voluntary.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.323" offset="7284694">And indeed, certain kinds of plea proceedings might be ones which this Court could trust when defendants made expressions of voluntariness therein as being the kind of plea proceeding which would later bar him from attacking the plea in collaborating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.108" offset="7351777">Such as a plea proceeding in which the defendant is represented by counsel or a plea proceeding in which the Rule 11 procedure is not engaged in the form of ritual as it was here, but is a genuine inquiry by the Trial Court into the nature of the charge, the defendants understanding of it and his voluntary participation in the plea proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1876.422" offset="7609031">I think it frequently is. Finally the Government argues that the files and records of this case conclusively show in effect that the petitioner was a liar and they alleged that it took them 18 months to file a petition under 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.399" offset="7664933">He also filed a brief of law in conjunction with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.301" offset="7676531">He was 26 years old at the time and it might take someone 18 months to file the kind of brief he did in fact filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.565" offset="7701608">The Government alleges that in exaggerating his illnesses and his hospital appearances, the petitioner confused one hospital record with another as if to say no evidentiary hearing is necessary because the hospital records refute the petitioner’s claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.624" offset="7769840">The hospital records, this Court will --I submit to this Court, should be investigated quite carefully and none of them were written at the time of the events they purport to describe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.837" offset="7814771">The first one three days after the petitioner left the hospital, the second one three months after the petitioner left the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.566" offset="7837654">So that for example, it is no indication of the petitioner’s incredibility whatsoever that his first hospital record does not show as he alleged that he’d bled from a gun wound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.836" offset="7882689">It does show that he had a gun wound, a gun wound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.644" offset="7893974">It does not indicate that he arrived at the hospital bleeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.658" offset="7905991">But the record itself does not show that the person who wrote it, three days after, not after the petitioner arrived at the hospital but three days after he left the hospital was even the doctor who examined him first and therefore would’ve been in the position to check a matter like whether his wound was bleeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.858" offset="7978820">Thirdly, the Government suggests that the petitioner admitted guilt at sentencing and indeed he did so but he alleges that not merely as plea of guilty but his admissions at the plea were coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.295" offset="8028557">And finally, the Government says that his allegation that he didn’t understand the jargon at the plea proceeding is absurd because the government -- because the Court used only simple terms like banks, guns, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.575" offset="8077667">The Court also used some not simple terms like waiver, a term that the Government fails to include in its list of simple terms and to the extent indeed that it explained waiver, it explained it wrongfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.832" offset="8122702">And indeed, the Government's argument on the jargon gets us back to what I do believe is in fact the main issue in this case, that there was no valid guilty plea under Boykin against Alabama, that there was no valid guilty plea under McCarthy against the United States and that there was -- and that this record does not disclose an understanding intelligent waiver of counsel as this Court’s cases from Johnson against Zerbst to Carnley required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.662" offset="8230013">Accordingly, this Court should remand to the District Court with directions to vacate the guilty plea without further evidentiary hearing or in the alternative for an evidentiary hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2056.407" offset="8328965">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.610" offset="8345788">The Government’s position is that the files and the records in this case conclusively show within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. 2255 that petitioner was competent at the time he pleaded guilty to armed bank robbery, that his plea was voluntary and that he validly waived counsel before entering the plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.666" offset="8434082">The District Court was therefore warranted in denying petitioner’s collateral attack on his plea without a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.349" offset="8464802">Now in contrast to Mr. Umin, I would like to discuss the voluntariness issue first and then come to the waiver issue and I’d like to point out what we think are the pertinent facts as far as the voluntariness issue is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.108" offset="8531780">Petitioner alleged in his motion that he was arrested on October 21 and the hospital discharge summary attached to his motion shows that on the night or at least on the 21st, he was admitted to the hospital for a five-day stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.105" offset="8595832">All of the alleged acts of intimidation and coercion referred to in petitioner’s motion took place either immediately after his arrest or during that initial period of hospitalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.714" offset="8646196">On November 13th, or 18 days after his discharge from the hospital, petitioner pleaded guilty to armed bank robbery before Judge Kayes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2393.624" offset="9677824">We suggest and it’s our basic position that where this is substantial period of time between the alleged acts of coercion and the guilty plea that then unless there are some very specific objective, allegations of objective facts as to why those acts of coercion taint the plea that in that situation it’s reasonable to expect the defendant to answer truthfully to the Court’s questions at the guilty plea hearing as to whether there were any threats or promises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.549" offset="9817527">Now, I’d like to address myself to Rule 11 and the hearing which was held here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.893" offset="9842918">Now, Rule 11 requires that the judge personally address the defendant on three matters; on the voluntariness of the plea, on petitioner’s understanding of the nature of the charge, and on his understanding of the consequence of the plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.078" offset="9903731">Now, we suggest that was complied with, if you look at the reading of the record, it shows that was complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.620" offset="9929853">Rule 11 also requires that the judge satisfy himself that there is a factual basis for the plea and we suggest that that also was complied with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.578" offset="9969664">With respect to the point about whether the bank was insured by the FDIC, the judge had before him the information and the information is not in the record, but it was attached to the Government’s brief in the Court of Appeals and the information does state that the bank was insured by the FDIC, so we believe that Judge Kayes would’ve been perfectly satisfied that the federal element of the offense was present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.952" offset="10091186">Now, we acknowledge that there are situations and we spell them out in some detail in our brief where a defendant’s answers at a guilty plea hearing that his plea is voluntary should not be binding upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.853" offset="10154820">Now, one obvious situation would be where he later alleged that he was mentally incompetent at the time of the plea and another situation would be where a prosecutor expressly warns him not to disclose the terms of a promise of leniency to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.577" offset="10225664">In this situation and there are a number of Court of Appeals, cases involving this type of situation and indeed the Machibroda case was this type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.719" offset="10266206">In this type of situation the defendant obviously cannot be expected to answer truthfully, having been advised by the prosecutor to do – to answer falsely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.792" offset="10322526">But apart from those situations, we suggest that the defendant can be expected to answer these questions that he -- the petitioner -- the only connection that petitioner draws in his motion between the acts of coercion and the guilty plea is the statement that the police had conditioned his mind for the guilty plea hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.867" offset="10426807">Now, this is a purely subjective allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.561" offset="10437569">There are no allegations that the police continued to coerce him while he was awaiting arraignment or that the police expressly warned him not to disclose their threats to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.698" offset="10498173">Now, this Court has recognized that coercive conduct maybe sufficiently separated from a later guilty plea so as not to affect the voluntariness of the plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.538" offset="10537566">In Parker against North Carolina, one of the claims made that alleged police conduct in procuring a confession in itself tainted a guilty plea, although it was over a month later, one of the claims was that the act in, coercing the confession tainted the plea a month later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.613" offset="10613844">This Court rejected that claim and it said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.115" offset="10627845">“The connection if any between Parker’s confession and his plea of guilty had become so attenuated, to dissipate the taint.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.494" offset="10657311">Now, there is a basic difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.311" offset="10668596">The Court pointed out that in the interim, Parker had been represented by a counsel and had had an opportunity to discuss the facts surrounding the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.619" offset="10705899">But the Court also said that after the allegedly coercive interrogation, there were no threats, misrepresentations, promises or other improper acts by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.030" offset="10759502">Now, petitioner in this case has not alleged that there were any threats, misrepresentations, promises or other improper acts for the almost three-week period before his plea.</text>

            <text syncTime="2720.583" offset="10985723">Now, in our view, there is sound basis in this Court’s decisions for the general proposition that a defendant should be bound by his responses at a guilty plea hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.244" offset="11024384">As this Court noted in McCarthy against the United States at 394 US, there are two basic purposes for the Rule 11 requirement that a judge personally address the defendant before accepting a guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.881" offset="11082898">First, the rule is designed to assist the judge in making a determination on the voluntariness of the plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.933" offset="11107140">Second, the rule is intended to produce, and I quote from the Court’s opinion, “A complete record at the time the plea is entered of the factors relevant to this voluntariness determination to enable more expeditious disposition of post-conviction attacks on the constitutional validity of guilty pleas.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.773" offset="11194493">Later in the opinion, the Court observed that Rule 11 is designed to eliminate any need to resort to any later fact finding proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.793" offset="11230542">Now, we do not contend that compliance with Rule 11 eliminates the necessity for further fact finding proceedings in every case and I have referred to some of the situations where it would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.817" offset="11282683">But we do contend that in this case and as a general rule, that the record the defendant makes should bind him against further proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="3171.429" offset="12789112">That our first argument is that as a matter of law, that if he is given the opportunity, I mean if he is asked in compliance to Rule 11, “Were there any threats?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.781" offset="12834461">And he says, “No, there weren’t and there are none of the special circumstances present which we concede would relieve him from the binding effect of that answer, then as a matter of law, he is not entitled later on to contradict that record which he himself made and that that is what is conclusively shows that he is entitled to no relief, but we don’t rely exclusively on that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.290" offset="12924531">We also say that if you look at as Mr. Stewart pointed out that if you look at all of the records that there is enough here to show that he was entitled to no relief in any event and I would just refer briefly to those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.328" offset="12996733">We think that the fact that a central part of his allegations are that he was innocent, that he did not rob any bank, that the police convinced him that he was a bona fide bank robber and told them that he had robbed this bank at a certain time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.237" offset="13072280">Well, we think that the record as a whole refutes this allegation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3271.585" offset="13189726">The other factors, very important in his allegations are the allegations of brutality when he was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.960" offset="13219192">He alleged he was clubbed into an unconscious state of mind at his home, that he was struck several times with fists and open hands at the police station.</text>

            <text syncTime="3292.563" offset="13273631">He also asserted he was beaten for asking to see an attorney and then the brief of law attached to his motion, he claimed he had been brutally assaulted, beaten with the clubs and blackjacks and kicked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.577" offset="13325667">Now, yet the hospital records pertaining to his period of hospitalization beginning on the night of the arrest makes no references to any bruises or recent bleeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.314" offset="13372583">And surely that would have been an evidence had petitioner suffered the type of mistreatment that he claims he had suffered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.547" offset="13405602">Now, the -- we also would say that the 21-month delay between the guilty plea hearing and the time that he filed his motion is also indicative of the lack of substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.220" offset="13480208">It’s certainly not a controlling point that we think it does when added together with all the other factors does show that this is not a -- that the motion is not well founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.127" offset="13543842">Now, the question as to whether the petitioner was mentally competent at the time is covered in our brief and I won't go into that now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.624" offset="13589817">On the waiver of counsel issue, I’d like to just make a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.437" offset="13613119">First of all, petitioner was 26 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.297" offset="13628583">He had a seventh grade education and by his own admission, he had a long criminal record and had been proceeded against in numerous criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.131" offset="13675917">In his petition at Page 11, he admits that he misspoke when he informed the Court that he didn’t have a record at the guilty plea hearing and admitted that he had a long record and also indicated the F -- he referred to FBI records which would indicate that there had been federal charges as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.039" offset="13755538">It’s thus highly unlikely that he was confused when the judge advised him of his right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.075" offset="13811649">Now, we would also point out that in the light of this, in the light of the fact that the US Attorney had given him the waiver form, he had signed the waiver form, the waiver of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.684" offset="13878105">The US Attorney had given him the information and said that he had acknowledged that he understood it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.831" offset="13898689">The information claim contained the elements of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.781" offset="13922513">So that, we say that when you look at this record as a whole, it shows that there was an intelligent and knowing waiver of counsel and that therefore, at that point, that there was a valid waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.596" offset="14009762">Well, in conclusion, it's argued that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</text>
