            <text syncTime="352.534" offset="1513514">Now, that’s the Act before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.090" offset="1523754">That’s the Act that effectively restored all of the lands on the old Klamath River Reservation to homestead settlement and provide for individual trust allotments to the Indians with respect to those lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.484" offset="1577357">Now, the Solicitor General in its AC brief has made the contention that this is merely one of many examples of legislative action in which Congress attempted to utilize the old General Allotment Act for the purpose of training over trust allotments to the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.041" offset="1643499">The General Allotment Act basically provided that with respect to a large reservation area, any lands which are not being used by the Indians and which are surplus to their needs can be sold to homesteaders who want to receive the lands and that the proceeds from the sale can then go back into the reservation’s operating funds, so as to augment the operating capital of reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.092" offset="1727718">And this Court has held on many occasions that it was not the intent or the purpose of the General Allotment Act determining an Indian reservation, and we have no quarrel with that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.250" offset="1764394">But the Government’s argument in trying to tie this case and with the purpose and spirit of the General Allotment Act really ignores the very unique historical context surrounding the Klamath River Reservation which is before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.868" offset="1822804">The Government’s argument raises -- ignores the unusual historical circumstances that led Congress in 1892 that passed the Act in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.410" offset="1856972">Now, I’d like to refer specifically what I consider to be the two main historical factors considered by Congress in passing the 1892 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.058" offset="1895633">First, this is I think foremost the Indians by the time the 1892 Act was passed have largely abandoned the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.976" offset="1931264">They were no longer there for all practical purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.821" offset="1946624">If you refer to decision in United States versus Forty-eight Pounds of Rising Star Tea cited by both parties in this case, you’ll see that when the reservation was originally created in 1855, there were 2,500 Indians on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.408" offset="2005034">But by the time the case was decided in 1888, there were only 200 Indians left.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.485" offset="2025305">And then if you look at the congressional reports which are cited at length in my opening brief, you’ll find that Congress estimated that the number of Indians left on the reservation at that time was 40 to 60.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.788" offset="2070549">I have also located an 1892 census conducted by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs in which he found that they where only 30 --</text>

            <label>Mr. Roderick Eugene Walston</label>
            <text syncTime="523.316" offset="2196668">Yes, the 40 to 60 figure, and that’s contained in the statements of the Bills, authors or the bill’s author or I should say Spokesman in the Senate at 23 Congressional Record 3918.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.411" offset="2257063">He specifically said that they where 40 to 60 Indians left on the old reservation at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.583" offset="2281723">An 1892 census conducted by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs apparently only located 30 Indians remaining on the old Klamath River Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.156" offset="2315995">And this is reported -- this back I piece together from two different sources of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.187" offset="2336162">First, the census actually found 505 Indians total on both the Klamath River Reservation and the area 20 miles upstream from the Klamath River Reservation which everybody refers to as the connecting strip, and that fact is reported in Annual Report of Commissioner of Indian Affairs to Secretary of Interior year 1892, page 784.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.422" offset="2433024">Then, according to the trial commissioner’s findings in the Short case which had been heavily relied upon by both the Commissioner and the United States in this case at page 55, it was stated the 475 of this Indians were located on the upstream area, and thus out of the Klamath River Reservation that leaves only 30 Indians left on the old reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.045" offset="2511600">So that means from a practical purposes that more than 95% of the Indians on the Klamath River Reservation lift the reservation between the time that it was originally created in 1855, and the time that the 1892 Act was before Congress, and that is the first historical fact that I think has some significance in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.693" offset="2590177">Secondly, after the Indians move out of the area, the homesteaders moved into the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.132" offset="2615881">And according to the congressional debates which as I say had been quoted at length in my opening brief, most of the lands in the old reservation area where then taken over by the homesteaders, and they occupy this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.606" offset="2661752">They lived on the -- they took over the arable lands that were located along rivers banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.116" offset="2683800">So, we have the Indians basically leaving the area and the white settlers moving into the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.228" offset="2708250">And many Bills were offered in the Congress through the 1818’s for the purpose of perfecting the title of these homesteaders to the lands which they occupied.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.139" offset="2739911">The 1892 Act was a direct outgrowth of all these congressional efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.453" offset="2757151">This is the historical context that I am referring to and that I think distinguishes this case from the Seymour case and that also distinguishes this case from the typical type of case in which Congress utilize the General Allotment Act for the purpose of distributing surplus lands to homesteaders for the Indian’s benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.703" offset="2830190">Now, Congress was very greatly persuaded and influenced by these historical circumstances to which I’ve alluded is very unique historical circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.287" offset="2868537">In fact, if you look at the House Report connected with HR 38 which is the Bill that eventually became the Act, you find the following statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.740" offset="2902288">This reservation, the Klamath River Reservation, and this is Congress speaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.096" offset="2919737">This reservation became abandoned in law as it has been in fact since the winter of 1861-1862.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.624" offset="2949831">And the Bill went on into Congress and the Bill was reported on the floor of the Congress by Representative Gary.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.097" offset="2975744">And during the course of his discussion and his oral presentation to Congress, he said as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.692" offset="2998105">In 1861, the reservation was abandoned and has never been since used for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.498" offset="3021406">Since 1868, it has been occupied by settlers.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.967" offset="3035199">Then after the Bill passed the House, it went into the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.905" offset="3047006">There the bill was amended to provide for trust allotments to the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.944" offset="3063097">The petitioner Raymond Mattz claimed that this trust allotment amendment somehow very basically altered the nature of the Bill, and yet, the bill spokesman in the Senate said the same thing and virtually the same language that was said in the House Report and by the bill spokesman in the House, and let’s hear the Senator who spoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.625" offset="3133837">He said, the Klamath River Reservation has never been used as an Indian reservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="793.183" offset="3276152">Yes, I believe it’s the green block on the map.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.507" offset="3297364">The number of Indians located on this land is various -- on the reservation is very is variously estimated up from 40 to 60 Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.689" offset="3330173">Quoting again, “There are great many settlers upon this land.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.130" offset="3343862">It is not practically an Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.615" offset="3361834">It never has been used for that purpose.”</text>
            <text syncTime="818.013" offset="3375417">So, that’s Congress speaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.173" offset="3380015">That’s what Congress had in mind and it’s quite clear from his language, this congressional language that Congress did not regard this as a fact a reservation in 1892.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.922" offset="3415019">It did not consider that this area was actually operating for the purposes for which reservations normally operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.625" offset="3437902">It clearly indicated that after the 1892 Act was passed that the reservation was not intended to survive the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.445" offset="3465174">That’s the clear and only meaning that can be attributed to this congressional language.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.162" offset="3483982">These assurances by the bill spokesman where apparently very important in securing the passage of the Bill, and it must have been the Congress that the spokesman assumed and the Congress assumed that they where not going to open a large reservation for homestead entry and settlement if they wanted the area to continue to function as an Indian reservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="871.717" offset="3590248">Well, at this point Your Honor, I am referring more to the congressional intent behind the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.013" offset="3611460">The language of the Act itself merely provides for entry and settlement to homesteaders and it also provides for trust allotments to the Indians, and then in the first sentence -- I believe, it’s the first sentence of the Act, the 1892 Act specifically refers in the past tense, rather than the present tense to the Klamath River Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.092" offset="3695783">It says I believe, it refers I believe to both lands and what was the Klamath River Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.740" offset="3722324">Now, the petitioner has pointed out that that language, the use of that past tense is subject to many conflicting inferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.139" offset="3747924">And if they where no congressional history before this Court, I would strongly agree with there could be conflicting inferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.709" offset="3770180">But with the congressional and statements that were -- that are made on the floor of Congress, it’s quite apparent that this reference in the past tense is quite consistent with the statements which were made by the bill spokesman in both the House and the Senate, and thus indicates that Congress simply did not intent for the area to continue as a reservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1389.197" offset="5660191">Incidentally, I made an error in my opening brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1395.639" offset="5685896">Actually, it was enacted in 1951 and it was re-codified in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.392" offset="5704913">That means that for 22 years, nearly a quarter of a century, California has been regulating Yurok fishing activity in the Klamath River, and nobody has objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.068" offset="5743679">The BIA has not objected.</text>

            <text syncTime="1474.833" offset="6002709">In other words, they can simply take as many fish as they want from the river each day, except for three very critical types of fish, the sturgeon, the salmon and the trout.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.286" offset="6036564">But the white man who fishes in that river is subject to daily bag limits with respect to every type of fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.045" offset="6059551">So, California has recognized for nearly a quarter of a century that the Indians, that the Yurok Indians fishing in that area has special problems and that they have a special dependency on this fishery, unless that they should be given some type of special consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.267" offset="6112423">But at the same time, I think we are highly cognizant in California that needs of the fishery itself, it needs to be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.920" offset="6139068">It can’t sustain an unending yield forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.235" offset="6152338">The Fish and Game Officials in California feel very strongly that if the Yuroks are allowed to fish without restriction in this area, the fishery might and probably very will be irreparably damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.888" offset="6190895">So, in California, we try to reconcile these two competing needs, the needs of the Indians, the needs of the fishery itself and we’ve come up with Section 7155 which has worked for nearly a quarter of a century and we -- I respectfully ask this Court to uphold the decision of the California Court of Appeals and allow California to go on trying to work -- working this question out on an ad hoc basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1590.188" offset="6464136">One of those, although it doesn’t appear anywhere in the record is the Hoopa Indian Reservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1712.659" offset="6953984">You remember that the extension is an extension of the Hoopa Valley Reservation set aside for Indian purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1845.424" offset="7485106">In Donnelly, the court stated that it assume that the river was none navigable and then said that whether or not the river was navigable in fact, its bed was deemed as included within the extension of the Hoopa Valley Reservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1878.031" offset="7615509">I asked to the number of Indians living on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.239" offset="7628361">The record -- I think does not support what has been said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.010" offset="7651453">40% of this land was allotted to the Indians of this reservation and in addition, the Indians were given villages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.411" offset="7672978">We do not know how many Indians lived in those villages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.121" offset="7687816">The worst statements made on the floor of Congress saying that there were only 40 to 60 Indians there, but I think those were -- the remarks rather over eager promoters of the settlers interests and not the views of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.329" offset="7740688">The references to an abandoned reservation in the House where repudiated in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.835" offset="7766706">They in addition were clearly referring to the Klamath River Reservation if you read the House Report in its entirety, you see that the words “abandoned reservation” to refer reservation abandoned at the 1860’s and they talked about the decision if Forty-eight Pounds of Rising Star Tea which is the decision which said that the Klamath River Reservation could not continue to exist because it violated the 1864 for Reservations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.294" offset="7872554">They where not talking about the Hoopa Extension as is clear by the fact that during the debates, there is no mention of the Hoopa Extension and in fact, the -- at two points, the Congress indicated they didn’t even think there was a reservation legally in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.973" offset="7939218">Finally, I would like to say that the phrase “what was the Klamath River Reservation in this Act” is not subject to conflicting interest of interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.691" offset="7974118">I have never suggested that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.944" offset="7979133">I think it’s only subject to one inference, and that is that the Klamath River Reservation was dead at the time that this 1892 Act was passed that Congress knew it was shown in House Act and have been held so, and that that phrase was used merely to describe a particular portion of land, not to have any tarnations effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.433" offset="8053112">I would contrast that with the Act passed two weeks later relating to the north half of Colville which said that this reservation is here by vacated and restored on public domain.</text>

            <text syncTime="2019.055" offset="8179545">Counsel said that approximately 40% of the old Klamath River Reservation was taken over by the Indians after the 1892 Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.035" offset="8219564">I would refer the Court to the Annual Reports of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to the Secretary of Interior for the years 1895 through 1900.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.519" offset="8253419">For example, the 1895 report at page 582, and that shows that the total acreage cultivated by Indians on both the Klamath River Reservation and the upstream 20 miles area together was only 400 acres, and that figure reappears in each Annual Report of the Commissioner from 1895 to 1900.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.809" offset="8350595">And that shows that the Klamath River Reservation -- that the Indians on old Klamath River Reservation were actually cultivating less than 400 acres on the old reservation, which of course is less than one square mile.</text>
