            <text syncTime="30.629" offset="225886">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.375" offset="236857">The issue in this case concerns the application of the Fourth Amendment to interior searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.988" offset="259323">More specifically the petitioner contends that the nature and extent of this search permitted by immigration regulation is in conflict with the Fourth Amendment, the Carroll decision and the litany of precedent, following that decision, basically can the government authorize a regulation that permits a search of an automobile on a highway without a warrant and more specifically without probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.321" offset="372694">That is the issue.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <text syncTime="75.959" offset="407176">I think that this Court under its general mandate, if it could construe the statute so as to find the constitution would do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.816" offset="442598">However, I think the regulation would fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.801" offset="454614">The question is, what is reasonable distance and I think the Court would have to make it eminently clear what reasonable distance is to adjudicate this particular issue.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="97.565" stopTime="112.439">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="97.565" offset="493589">But would we fix that Mr. Cleary in terms of 37 Â½ miles or would we say a reasonable distance in the context of the geographical area in which it occurred, which way would we (Voice Overlap).</text>

          <turn speaker="john_j_cleary" startTime="112.439" stopTime="231.826">
            <label>Mr. John J. Cleary</label>
            <text syncTime="112.439" offset="553148">You Honor, it is really faced with a tough decision in that area and I would suggest that in reviewing the Glazu (ph) decision where it was a peer search.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.794" offset="586585">Judge Browning in his dissent in this case called it a substantial equivalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.350" offset="600795">I would, if the Court would permit, suggest a decision that has a judicial import and not a legislative one so as to try to quantify.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.664" offset="634023">That decision after reading the decisions in this case and many others, I would suggest would be that distance necessary for the customs to make the first practical contact with the entrant after crossing the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.755" offset="698389">Now, with that definition, you can apply it so as to take care of the situation where the man flies from Acapulco to Chicago or the man is in the immediate proximity of the area and he outruns the border inspector, but at the other end of this scale which I would contend that this continuous surveillance technique, and as modified in the Alexander case called a substantial continuous surveillance because you can have some interruption, my suggested rule would be a one shot rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.780" offset="818448">Meaning that if the law enforcement officers allow the person to pass through customs and he clears it, then any search thereafter must be based upon probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.995" offset="867349">If the government having reliable informants and having say corroboration under Draper or the other decisions of this Court would then contend that they can arrest the person once into the interior if further information has been corroborated, would have probable cause and would need this subterfuge of a border search.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.432" offset="941119">So I would suggest to the Court that a definition of border search is possible to quantify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.310" offset="964629">I think is next to impossible because I could be searched right now under the existing regulation if I got into an automobile and were to drive to national airport on the grounds that I might be from a country, say a virulent or some other basis and they were looking for other Irish people in the vehicle.</text>

            <text syncTime="236.064" offset="1047594">There were some question there, Your Honor in that one Mr. Justice Rehnquist because the first statement was on being inquired and he said, I picked up the car in Calexico which is in the interior of the United States whereas another statement of the customs man when he stopped and said, I came from Mexicali, would have meant he was born in Mexicali and of course as his immigration card was marked, indicated that he did have some residence in Mexicali, but there was no evidence, I would contend in this record of a border entry and again the point is, we have to look ab initio at the stop on the highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.342" offset="1188760">That officer did not know whether the man had cleared the border and they had to stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.827" offset="1210702">This was just a random sampling, using his own rule of thumb whatever discretion whim caprice had in stopping an automobile.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.341" offset="1244766">But your statement of the rule I thought had as a part of the rule that when a man had cleared customs then there would be a certain limits, probable cause limits.</text>

            <text syncTime="297.234" offset="1292309">And I was wondering how that rule would apply to this particular case?</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Cleary</label>
            <text syncTime="300.477" offset="1305266">In this case, since there was no border entry observed, the only way that vehicle could be stopped on the highway consistent with the Carroll decision is upon probable cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="309.601" offset="1341733">You say, the burden of proof then is on the government to show that he had not come through customs rather than the burden of proof on him to show that he did?</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Cleary</label>
            <text syncTime="320.507" offset="1385409">I think the burden of proof would be on the government, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, if they were seeking (1) an exemption of the warrant requirement and (2) an exemption of the probable cause requirement, I think that would be eminently fair.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="330.709" offset="1426160">But if he didn't come through customs, then would not his strong position be that he is just a local fellow who is out for a ride and he had never been to Mexico in his life?</text>

            <text syncTime="344.774" offset="1482480">Your Honor, that would possibly be his contention, but the more important issue is the stopping of the vehicle to make this type of search.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.019" offset="1511424">What is not before the Court right now is an interstitial area known as the founded suspicion, a situation where a vehicle might be briefly detained on is the highway so that the officer could make some initial questions or check of the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.283" offset="1568475">That's not an issue here and if I could point out two other serious aspects of this case; the government and its total candor which is always been the position, has cited to you not only the Rule that permits up to a hundred air miles but 287.1 sub B points out that the customs, I mean excuse me, the immigration director can go beyond the 100-mile limit if he so desires.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.315" offset="1656665">So that the 100-mile is not a estop and the second point --</text>

            <text syncTime="401.857" offset="1710791">In the sense of not permitting the search though of this random search as they would now interpret it.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="406.642" offset="1729912">But B has all sorts of seeming safeguards in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.472" offset="1753213">The district director has to forward a completely report with respect to the matter to the commission and justify anything within a 100-mile (Inaudible).</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Cleary</label>
            <text syncTime="420.442" offset="1785187">I can have point out another serious constitutional defect in a regulation, is that this Court in Coolidge versus New Hampshire struck down an Attorney General acting with its another hat as Justice of the Peace issuing out his own search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.912" offset="1835029">Does it not seem anomalous to this Court that here we have the Attorney General defining what is reasonable distance or what is the exempted area of the Fourth Amendment?</text>
            <text syncTime="444.261" offset="1880377">And so for the executive to take that type of role in cutting down a Fourth Amendment application and as I point out to the Court, the Fourth Amendment does not have first of all, an exception in it for the border, but this Court in the Carroll case held that the Fourth Amendment will be interpreted at the time of its adaption and certainly border searches are proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.399" offset="1968985">But if I were council for the establishment in 1776 in this country and were thinking of ways in which to draft legislation or rules authorizing a writ of assistance, I couldn't do a better job than what we have right here in this regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.378" offset="2032933">And I would suggest to the Court that it is not the authority of the executive to so limit, define, contract the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.558" offset="2065638">It applies throughout the United States and I think it is the function of this Court to uphold it.</text>

            <text syncTime="503.386" offset="2116942">It applies to, it can search any vehicle, meaning it could be anyone's vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.394" offset="2136900">Your Honor's vehicle could be down the highway and technically under this regulation, you could be stopped and not only are you questioned, but your vehicle is searched and the trunk opened up and in the case we have in point to show you how far they are gone under the seat and there is even Ninth Circuit cases where they looked in paper bags for aliens and the Court held that, of course, that was not a proper place to look for aliens or in (Inaudible) crevices and in other places, but it shows the potential for abuse in such searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.530" offset="2253511">I would further point out and I would like to cite to the Court an additional authority in Ninth Circuit opinion written by Judge Hufstedler, it's U.S. versus Mallides, it's slip opinion only, 72-1898 and it was decided on the 22nd of January and there, six of Mexican appearing individuals driving down a highway in a Chrysler automobile steered straight ahead as a patrol car passed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.951" offset="2363225">They were stopped and they were interrogated and the court there reviewed that this was of course an improper stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.468" offset="2393213">The reason I raise this is that such a regulation or its implementation can be clearly discriminatory in its application, that is to say even the governmentâs brief at page 24, in the footnote in the last line points out the these stops on a random sampling are made on apparent nationalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.879" offset="2474924">Well, I do not know how one can physically observe oneâs nationality other than to use certain racial or color characteristics and I think that --</text>

            <text syncTime="615.157" offset="2563950">I think that the stop for aliens and that is the reasonable alternative in this case is to apply the protective and preventative measures at the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.170" offset="2608044">If you look at our border, there are just holes in the fence all the way along.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.335" offset="2624763">The government contends there is 2,000 miles of border, there is 4,000 on Canada and they got 1,400 out of their 1,700 border patrol officers down on the Mexican border.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.069" offset="2667604">The question is and I think appropriately is they are stopped at the border and if we don't have so to speak a preventative policing of the border, then we should not allow the highest pragmatism with the government to lay back and claim inherent exceptions to the Fourth Amendment to stop all vehicles.</text>

            <text syncTime="711.158" offset="2948054">I further would point out that one of the other problems with these type of searches is, we are not dealing with the minor intrusion, we're not dealing with the licensing requirement. We're dealing with a serious look for evidence, evidence of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.028" offset="2999463">The government has cited the See, Camara, Colonnade and Biswell decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="765.600" offset="3165811">In this case, there was not a momentary detention and the possibility for a subterfuge or something other than just an alien check as in this case is just paramount.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.576" offset="3213667">I would point out that in dealing with the Camara and See cases, we had situations where a warrant was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.181" offset="3240103">It was held not only was manâs residence protected to a certain degree even though the probable cause requirement could be dropped but also a business.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.534" offset="3273540">In the Colonnade, Biswell cases, I would tender to the Court four basic distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.923" offset="3295065">First, the group involved in that area is a self-defined target group, that is to say, men who have chosen their particular occupation, firearms or the liquor business.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.484" offset="3333308">Two, that in this business venture, there is not a justifiable expectation of privacy one would expect in an automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.503" offset="3361416">And when the statute and regulation here says vehicle that would include also van, it would include camper which is kind of like a quasi home and a mobile home which might be a personâs only home on the highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.932" offset="3411048">Second of all, I would indicate that the searches in Colonnade and Biswell were of business establishment during day light hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.367" offset="3436857">This case, it was in shortly after midnight, stopped on a highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.280" offset="3452531">It's a very personal in nature when you start to go through a manâs vehicle which this Court with Justice Jackson in Brinegar has defined as one of the effects, the automobile itself that he was driving on a highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.986" offset="3491297">I would dare say that there are reasonable alternatives to the rule that is proposed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.695" offset="3510105">The first one is, greater registration requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.264" offset="3520449">There is now a requirement that aliens register in January.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.931" offset="3531107">I would suggest that one on employers; if registration was required by employers, it would be a great way to alleviate the burden of the illegal aliens in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.939" offset="3567156">Sometime, we do not consider the cause and effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.501" offset="3577396">Why are these aliens here?</text>
            <text syncTime="870.932" offset="3587114">And a little application of common sense logic would indicate that we had some type of registration or kind of control in that area, we might alleviate some of the problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.677" offset="3626088">Second one, on welfare and third; I would suggest even license in activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.450" offset="3645210">One of the best detectives for aliens in our area, happens to be the California Department of Motor Vehicles because people come in and do not have this evidence and they determine that they are here illegally.</text>

            <text syncTime="921.811" offset="3790660">Yes, Your Honor and I am not trying to indicate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.932" offset="3803094">I am saying that given the balancing of the interest here that at the border when operation intercept was in operation and custom backed up things along ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.311" offset="3836635">I might add to the Court that they have been substantially improved at the Tijuana Border.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.304" offset="3856593">They have a very expeditious way of processing.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.802" offset="3866624">However, I think the answer lies in applying the border search at the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.724" offset="3886268">And further, on the doctrine of pragmatism, I would suggest to the Court its own opinion in United States where U.S. District Court, in that case, this Court where the government contended a very strong issue, national security, this Court not only of course required the probable cause for wire tapping but even went further and said, we're not going to allow you to use that pragmatic approach to excuse even the warrant requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.540" offset="3977488">And all we're asking for here is once a vehicle is in the interior, it's on the highways, should not the government be required to have at least probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.189" offset="4016149">Some of the other reasons why this Court should be concerned with this particular rule, because of the dichotomy that exists as between contraband and aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.574" offset="4053661">On one hand, the introduction of this noxious controlled substance, be it marijuana, heroine or any of the other narcotics is a national interest, a super concern in fact in my humble opinion far more important than the question of a man from another country seeking a better way of life in our country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.521" offset="4133491">And that under the application of the law as it now stands, there must be probable cause once the vehicle clears the border area or the immediate border area and that Judge Browning in his dissent points out the strange dichotomy and I might point out to the Court that the statute used here is not as liberal as the customs statutes which are 19-482 and 19-1581.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.898" offset="4230980">They are far more liberal, yet the circuit and other circuits have held to allow those statute to operate without probable cause would fly in the face of the Fourth Amendment, but for aliens, we make an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.433" offset="4273089">I feel that, that is not a fair balancing of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.207" offset="4284165">Second, I would point out that we can sometimes in our federal system learn from the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.292" offset="4308511">Chief Justice Roger Traynor, California Supreme Court, a well-known national jurist, familiar with criminal law wrote well on this decision when dealing with sheriffs to try to justify a border search for a vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.966" offset="4359189">In fact, they might have had something that might have almost amounted to founded suspicion when a man had a dented fender and in People versus Giles, cited to you in the governmentâs brief, the court held that such a search would be intolerable and took the Carroll decision of this Court to find why state officers couldn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.574" offset="4433690">So on one hand, we have state officers who can't conduct such searches, but on the other hand, we have federal law officers with this unlimited power.</text>

            <text syncTime="1109.289" offset="4540479">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.930" offset="4543091">I only contend that a border search requires a border entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.087" offset="4559705">And in this case, a border entry was not established and also the type of search conducted here on the highways would apply anywhere in the United States when they almost covered the majority of the existing population in the United states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.573" offset="4609651">And although the government does point out that it would not exercise that power to conduct searches, say in Times Square in New York City, the Fourth Amendment does not rely upon the goodwill of the executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.921" offset="4655104">It is an absolute bar in that if there was some type of nexus shown with the border prior to the stop, a different situation might exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.724" offset="4686242">And I might also point out to the Court, we are not dealing with the founded suspicion situation, we are not dealing with the Terry versus Ohio situation or Adams versus William situation where there was a stop and a protect of, first for the officer involved which is certainly an anomaly reasonable type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.840" offset="4754683">With the Court permission, I would like to reserve time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1174.836" offset="4802748">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.168" offset="4816018">The case before the Court presents some very important Fourth Amendment issues as counsel for the petitioners just brought out, but as some of the questions from the bench indicate, there are important practical issues at stake here too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.361" offset="4876831">And I think it is important for the Court to keep both sets, theoretical and practical, of these issues are carefully in mind in tending to the arguments and in resolving the disputes between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.034" offset="4939525">First of all, it's important I think to give a little background on what the facts of this particular case are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.678" offset="4970036">The case, the search and seizure issue arose originally on stipulated facts on a motion to suppress and it was stipulated that two border patrol agents, members of the uniformed service of the Immigration and Naturalization Service with the responsibility for controlling illegal entry of aliens into the United States, were conducting a roving patrol on a state highway, Highway 78 in the South Eastern part of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.837" offset="5090722">In order to clarify the stipulated facts and to give the Court some further sense of the topography, we have included in our brief a map of the area involved to indicate the interrelationship of the points involved and if I may respectfully direct the Courtâs attention to the map which we had the army map service prepare, rather quickly I confess, so that it would be compact and yet would focus on the important areas in question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1296.154" offset="5287999">The stipulation was that Highway 78 on which they stopped, at a place, just South of Glamis, California is about the only north-south highway in Southern California leading away from the Mexican border that does not have an established checkpoint on it and for that reason, it is frequently patrolled by the border patrol.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.646" offset="5373994">Highway 78 of course is an even numbered highway generally runs east and west and we have included this map to show that the portion of the highway involved here where it runs near the Mexican border although it never touches the border, runs generally north easterly.</text>

            <text syncTime="1344.259" offset="5480364">In any event, down in the lower left-hand corner of the case begins, according to the stipulated facts, that's the border crossing point, at Calexico, California, the sister city of Mexicali, Mexico, the point from which petitioner can see that he at least began his journey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.684" offset="5554134">He said that he picked up the automobile that was stopped and searched across the border in Calexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.862" offset="5578794">He said he was driving up to Blythe, California which is in the extreme top right-hand corner of the map, the little yellow area is the town of Blythe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.657" offset="5626023">The only road that leads through this approximately 120 mile drive across mountains and generally dessert, is Highway 78 and as the Court can see, Glamis is circled almost on the center of the map.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.897" offset="5694986">Although it is shown as a town, the Atlas that I, and this is not in the record but I believe also, it might be a subject of official notice the official Atlas' list, the population of Glamis is somewhere between 10 and 100 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.518" offset="5749426">But the point that I am trying to suggest is this was a desolate area.</text>

            <text syncTime="1801.391" offset="7308936">But the agents as is customary in inspecting vehicles for aliens, looked first in the trunk of the automobile which would of course be the natural place where aliens are discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.593" offset="7361703">Officer Shaw of the border patrol testified at the trial that when he looked in the trunk, he did not see any aliens or any other items but saw that the plate over the back springs of a car which of course was visible from the trunk area, the dividing material between the rear seat and the trunk was unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.898" offset="7455013">It was the standard kind of backing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.466" offset="7465253">He said it looked to him like cardboard or some other kind of light board and he thought that, that might indicate that this rear seat had actually been altered and relying, he testified on the intelligence bulletins from the border patrol, he entered the cabin of the automobile, removed the rear seat cushion and discovered marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.151" offset="7555950">The petitioner was then placed under arrest and a further search of the car turned up 73 kilo bricks of marijuana, 161 lbs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.820" offset="7602657">The government's position in this case on the legal questions is that under settled decisions of this Court, searches can be conducted as reasonable within the meaning of a Fourth Amendment even though there may not be probable cause to suspect that the object of the search is involved in illegal activity and even if there is no warrant specifically approving that search in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.427" offset="7717073">We have relied on several interrelated series of decisions in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.662" offset="7742046">We start with the proposition that the basic test under the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, that generally under the warrant clause this implies the two qualifications must be met in order for search to be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.338" offset="7800769">That is, that there must be probable cause for the search and that probable cause must be adjudicated in advance by a magistrate issuing a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.198" offset="7836191">This Court has held in numbers of cases but neither of those requirements is absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.349" offset="7864717">We rely primarily on the administrative inspection line of decisions, Camara versus the San Francisco Municipal Court and See versus the City of Seattle in which this Court specifically upheld the reasonableness of an area inspection program requiring access to private homes as well as to private businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.573" offset="7957713">Even without any reason to suspect, much less any probable cause to believe that a violation was taking place within the particular home or business.</text>

            <text syncTime="3333.613" offset="13437785">Is there a constitutional barrier do you think for Congress to set up a sanitare zone as it were and say that the border is going to be three miles or five miles wide from the identifiable international boundary, three miles, five miles back, this is boundary borders as far as the United States Immigration and Custom Services are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.664" offset="13550007">Would that have constitutional problems?</text>

            <text syncTime="3365.152" offset="13564008">I think it would have constitutional problems, however, it'd be in a much better posture than what we have here, specifically I think what Your Honor might be touching upon which has troubled me greatly about this particular case, is unlike Colonnade and Biswell where there was detailed statutory scheme set up where Congress outlined the procedure here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.745" offset="13642376">The statutes has reasonable distance and in the executive through the INS takes over with regulations and they set up the sanitized zone, I would say serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.293" offset="13680515">Now there might be a court case where Congress could create this sanitized area with certain limitations as to the nature of the intrusion that would be conducted limiting also the operation of these various checkpoints.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.611" offset="13741850">The ironic thing about this case is that the checkpoints are little borders so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.252" offset="13764420">If you are stopped on Interstate 5 going towards L.A., at the border what we call as the first stop is just initial check and if you look funny, you are suspicious or anything out of the ordinary, you are kicked over to what they call secondary and there they could literally take your car apart and you have little to say at the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.841" offset="13826696">The question, the ironic thing is when you are stopped at the checkpoints, the INS uses the same term over the secondary with the same limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.322" offset="13856684">They have created the second border exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.692" offset="13866088">Now, my only reaction is that, it kind of strikes at what the Fourth Amendment has designed to do for the executive do that, but I think the Congress as a lawmaker could sit down and work out certain things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.837" offset="13906735">I think also metropolitan areas would be in a different posture.</text>

            <text syncTime="3456.392" offset="13928991">I suppose, at least one of the considerations that moved the Congress to give rule-making power in a sense to the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.474" offset="13969220">It was that they wanted to have flexibility for the boundary near San Antonio, Texas or any other densely populated area and broader rule for this big open space that we have got on this map.</text>

            <text syncTime="3487.210" offset="14052185">Well, I think that's a possibly giving the counsel too much credit because the analysis, the legislative history is very sparse on this particular statute and further, I think this was a response to an exhortation of the government to include this amendment about reasonable distance and I feel that the matter was not properly dealt with by Congress in present posture of this case and that given the areas though, even open or desolate areas as they might be called, the person in those areas is no less of a person under our system of government than say, someone else so that the camper in that area who is a transient or the resident in that area, really because he is so fortuitously located near the border, so not subject him to some type of police surveillance to which, it's our contention of Fourth Amendment would prohibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.965" offset="14251238">In the posture of this case, I would also suggest that like the Carroll decision where they were looking for alcohol and not an administrative regulation just eliminating alcohol, here they're looking for aliens and the alien himself, one alien, no matter how big or how small is in violation of the statute, is present in the country, in violation of 1325 as counsel has pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.459" offset="14341204">The person carrying him is in violation of 1324, a felony dealing with either transporting or the bringing in unlawfully of aliens and further, that a man who comes back the second time after having been deported is not just a person we're going to slap on the wrist but who is subject to a felony prosecution under 8 U.S.C. 1326.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.259" offset="14412361">This is criminal business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.995" offset="14419362">Further, the other difficulty is in this particular matter is the scope with the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.586" offset="14437752">Now, counsel has said that there are few cases litigated about how far the immigration service go.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.438" offset="14461158">I think there is quite a few and not only that, but at the district court level, we had a case where the agent with his unique olfactory senses discovered what he thought was marijuana by sniffing hard in the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.600" offset="14509746">He sniffed so hard that he opened up the suitcase and there it was, narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.738" offset="14530330">He went to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.597" offset="14533778">The only trouble was when the motion to suppress was granted, it was cocaine in the suitcase rather than marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.764" offset="14558438">Another situation turned up on how far they go in locating aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.893" offset="14570977">There were two suitcases together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.544" offset="14577560">Neither one of which would hold an alien and they searched both trunks and the Court said, well that is not a very good thing, they had it go all the way to the Ninth Circuit, you should have pushed the cases apart before you started to look for an alien because it although was physical possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.990" offset="14639313">And I think that there is a certain amount of gymnastics that go on to allow legitimate law enforcement inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.291" offset="14668570">But I think in this area, if there is a reasonable bar as to contraband, a far more serious, a more harmful thing to our national interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.284" offset="14700544">Then that bar should stand also as to aliens.</text>

            <text syncTime="3652.391" offset="14712978">Would you think if Congress had the power to create some kind of a sanitare zone or cordon, they could require everyone in that area, day or night, 24 hours a day to have a pass?</text>

            <text syncTime="3669.561" offset="14781628">Well, Your Honor, I cannot speak as to the law but speaking as American citizen, I think that smacks of something that just so grows with our way of life that I can never understand Congress doing something.</text>

            <text syncTime="3685.819" offset="14846621">But that is at the border and that is if I leave this country but here in this country, if I carried something like that, I would have to start checking out my arm for some type of tattoo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.204" offset="14884237">It smacks of a form of government and so (Inaudible) that I doubt if there were something like that dealt by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="3716.424" offset="14969083">But would you think there is a Fourth Amendment problem there if people are required to carry and show their pass that this would be unreasonable?</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Cleary</label>
            <text syncTime="3725.595" offset="15005759">I think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.989" offset="15007326">I think also a Fifth Amendment going back to Shapiro versus Thompson and all the other ones on the freedom of movement concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.983" offset="15035329">There is clearly law and I fully agree with the right of aliens, carrying identification cards, the I-151, that is I think is legitimate, clearly legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.669" offset="15066049">But for American citizen to carry identification in that type of area, it might be also be an equal protection argument that a person is inside and not on the sanitized zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.765" offset="15106382">Why would he not have to carry such an application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.900" offset="15118921">It's fraught with problems of course.</text>

            <text syncTime="3757.790" offset="15134490">I think there is much ingenuity that could be worked out by Congress that was not handled in this particular case and I think that is one of the troublesome aspects.</text>
