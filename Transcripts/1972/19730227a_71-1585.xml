            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">We’ll hear arguments next in 71-1585, United States against Russell.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.192" offset="241121">Mr. Lacovara you may proceed whenever you’re ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip A. Lacovara</label>
            <text syncTime="37.660" offset="255018">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.261" offset="269437">This case, United States against Russell involves a very important issue in the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.920" offset="300053">Basically, whether a new defense to criminal liability is to be created that will focus exclusively on the nature of the conduct of an investigative agent in uncovering and detecting the criminal enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.637" offset="370897">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from which this case comes has held that such a defense should be created.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.557" offset="402662">The facts are basically simple and they are very few and probably no relevant controversies about the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.299" offset="441637">On December 7, 1969, an undercover agent for the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs accompanied by an informant, went to the home of the respondent, Richard Russell and there met with Mr. Russell and two other co-defendants in this case, John Connolly and Patrick Connolly.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.046" offset="532543">The agent in his testimony, set forth on page 4 of the appendix, explained what happened when he went to Mr. Russell’s home.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.811" offset="579668">I told Richard Russell and the two Connollys that I represented an organization interested in controlling the manufacture of methamphetamine, that is the dangerous drug involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.312" offset="625643">And then I represented the organization in the northwest area and I wanted to meet with the people who were manufacturing the methamphetamine and I wanted to obtain methamphetamine from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.796" offset="675589">The agent later explained that the terms of this business proposition to these people whom he said he understood to be manufacturing methamphetamine was that he would supply one of the chemical ingredients in the manufacture of the drug, phenyl-2-propanone in return for half of the output and he would like to buy the rest of the output for cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.559" offset="770675">Without any attempt to disabuse him of his understanding that they were currently manufacturing methamphetamine or to express any reluctance whatsoever to the business proposition the undercover agent put, Patrick Connolly said, “we’ve been manufacturing methamphetamine since at least May of 1969 and have manufactured about three pounds of it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="192.899" offset="876001">I might say for purposes of illustration that I've been told by the Bureau of Narcotics that the average medically recommended dose of methamphetamine is five milligrams according to the U.S. Pharmacopeia.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.016" offset="932425">The average illicit dose on the street is 10 milligrams which means that each gram of methamphetamine will produce approximately 100 illicit doses.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="221.263" stopTime="223.063">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="221.263" offset="989477">How many grams in a pound?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_a_lacovara" startTime="223.063" stopTime="241.438">
            <label>Mr. Philip A. Lacovara</label>
            <text syncTime="223.063" offset="996686">453 grams in a pound.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.882" offset="1019883">As we will see Mr. Justice Stewart, the amount of methamphetamine involved in this case would be enough for approximately 3,500 illicit doses and perhaps 7,000 illicit doses.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="241.438" stopTime="244.244">
            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="241.438" offset="1070143">Is this the drug that is commonly known as “Speed”?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_a_lacovara" startTime="244.244" stopTime="526.416">
            <label>Mr. Philip A. Lacovara</label>
            <text syncTime="244.244" offset="1081323">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.074" offset="1084667">Methamphetamine is Speed.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.008" offset="1092399">It’s a stimulant drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.367" offset="1101908">The prosecution in this case arises under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.897" offset="1119984">That Act is now been superseded by the 1970 Comprehensive Drug Abuse and Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.052" offset="1144644">Speed remains a control of drug under the new statute as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.023" offset="1164497">The agent however insisted that he would not provide any of this important ingredient unless and until the three-man partnership whom he confronted provided him with both the sample of the methamphetamine they had already manufactured, and also showed him the laboratory.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.159" offset="1253000">Patrick Connolly then with the agent left Mr. Russell’s house, brought the agent to his own home where he showed him some items of laboratory equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.354" offset="1289780">Before they left Russell’s house, John Connolly gave the agent a sample which he said “Had come from the last batch that had been manufactured.”</text>
            <text syncTime="306.644" offset="1330949">I emphasize that at no time did Richard Russell in whose presence that’s all occurred attempt to dissociate himself from the enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.527" offset="1366476">Pursuant to the arrangement, the agent return to Russell’s house the next, December 8th, but was told by Russell that Russell and Patrick Connolly had been unable to get the other chemicals necessary to manufacture the methamphetamine because they had arrived too late at the chemical supply store on the afternoon of the 8th.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.047" offset="1456546">Now, the respondent’s brief indicates that the record shows that Russell and Patrick Connolly had tried to get phenyl-2-propanone and had it had been refused to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.231" offset="1501372">I believe the record on pages 17 and 18 shows that they were going to get the other chemicals and simply arrived too late to get them.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.397" offset="1533973">In any event, they said they would get the chemicals the following day, December 9th, and when the agent return to Mr. Russell’s home, the home of the respondent on the afternoon of December 9th waited for Mr. Russell and Mr. Connolly.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.402" offset="1598025">The group then set out for Patrick Connolly’s home with the laboratory was located and after Patrick Connolly and Richard Russell began the chemical process by adding a variety of other chemicals to a flask, the agent then upon their request provided them with a bottle of 100 grams of phenyl-2-propanone.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.906" offset="1687991">The reaction process took about two hours according to the agent’s testimony from about 7:30 until 9:30.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.011" offset="1720487">After that began the separate phase, the drying and crystallization phase which was done on a hot plate with the ladies home hair dryer.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.394" offset="1761970">At about 12:40, 1/4 of the methamphetamine had been dried; that is after the beaker or flask had been chemically treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.893" offset="1812020">Mr. Connolly poured the liquid into four separate flasks and each flask was then dried on a Pyrex baking dish separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.860" offset="1851831">So at 12:40, the first transfer actually took place and that was approximately 10 grams or enough for about a thousand doses, illicit doses.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.471" offset="1894254">Agent Shapiro, the undercover agent left the Connolly home, left Mr. Connolly and Russell there and unbeknown to them secured the methamphetamine that it been given in his office in Seattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.086" offset="1952768">He returned the next morning at about 8 o’clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.726" offset="1967292">The respondent and Pat Connolly where still there drying the rest of the Speed.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.275" offset="1989548">After Russell succeeded in scraping off the remainder or the crystalline form of the drug into three more bags of methamphetamine, Patrick Connolly said to the agent, “You may have the rest of the batch” and Russell according to the testimony interjected after I get my half.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.546" offset="2074603">So, the agent was given one of the remaining three bags.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.209" offset="2089232">Richard Russell, the respondent took the other two bags.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.335" offset="2101770">The agent offered to buy the two bags for cash and Russell said, “That he already made arrangements to sell one of those bags for cash.”</text>
            <text syncTime="508.838" offset="2139700">In the course of the drive back to the respondent's home, Russell agreed to sell the remaining bag, the fourth bag to the undercover agent for cash and at his home, the agent paid him $60.00 and purchased approximately 9 1/2 grams of methamphetamine.</text>

            <text syncTime="530.552" offset="2226636">Only one agent involved in the actual transaction, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.284" offset="2241578">About three weeks later, Agent Shapiro contacted Patrick Connolly again at Connolly’s home which was where the laboratory was located, asked him if he was still interested in the business arrangement and Connolly replied that he was still interested, but in the interim, he had obtained two more bottles of phenyl-2-propanone which was the commodity of the agent was willing to supply and that he wouldn’t be finished with those for a few days.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.820" offset="2343664">A few days later along with the search warrant and an arrest warrant, Agent Shapiro and other Federal Agents raided Mr. Connolly’s home laboratory and seized over a 100 items that were admitted at the trial, included were chemical supply company catalogs, a variety of chemicals, laboratory equipment, and three bottles of phenyl-2-propanone.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.421" offset="2450035">One was the 100-gram bottle the agent had supplied and which he was able identify.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.194" offset="2473127">His second empty bottle was 500-gram bottle labeled to P2P which chemical analysis showed had actually contain the drug and the third bottle, a 100-gram bottle of P2P was still half full.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.242" offset="2533313">Mr. Connelly was indicted on five counts involving violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.862" offset="2563824">Mr. Russell was charged with three violations; manufacturing, processing and compounding as one count, delivering the controlled the drug at the time the first transfer had taken place, and the third count, selling a control of drug at the time that the agent purchased the final bag from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.193" offset="2657134">Now, the defense at the trial was entrapment, that was the only defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.582" offset="2670717">Respondent, however, did not testify of Patrick Connelly did.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.414" offset="2690048">The jury found him guilty, however, on all counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.379" offset="2701960">Mr. Connelly in his testimony admitted having told the agent that they have manufactured at least three pounds of it before the agent appeared on the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.365" offset="2741875">He also acknowledged that he had told the agent that he, Patrick, handled the chemical reaction phase of the business that his brother John normally did the drying and crystallization phase and that Richard Russell, the respondent here took care of the sales in return from 50% of the profits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1148.058" offset="4696670">First of all, his focus is generally on the some of the statements made in the separate opinions of the minority in the Sorrells and Sherman cases which are of course the two leading entrapment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.524" offset="4746512">In those opinions, Justices Roberts and Frankfurter said that the entrapment offense really ought to focus not on the subjective guilt or innocence of the defendant or on his predisposition to commit the crime, but rather ought to focus only on the nature of the officer’s conduct and if that conduct is intolerable, then there ought to be a bar to the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.182" offset="4841075">We’ll show in a few moments that that rationale is not applicable to this kind of case anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.919" offset="4864063">But the Ninth Circuit said under one of two theories of the defendant is entitled as a matter of law to dismissal of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.295" offset="4901575">First, they said, it is intolerable Government conduct to supply contraband to a defendant and then prosecute him for possession of the contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.847" offset="4947759">Now, the Court said by some process of extension that even though the phenyl-2-propanone was not contraband is not and was not a regulated to the chemical, nevertheless, without the delivery of that contraband could’ve been made and therefore what happened here was intolerable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.795" offset="5019544">That the Court said was a kind of extension of the traditional entrapment doctrine. Alternatively, the Ninth Circuit, Judge Elli’s opinion said, there is a separate kind of Due Process defense that ought to be recognized where the Government engages in too much of the continuing criminal enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.498" offset="5098433">When the Government becomes enmeshed in the enterprise for a reason similar to the reasons that support the entrapment defense, the Government ought to be precluded from prosecuting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.547" offset="5142632">Here, the Court said, because the undercover agent had supplied one of the ingredients and had been present during the manufacture, that precluded the Government from prosecuting.</text>

            <text syncTime="1316.147" offset="5368957">Chief Justice Hughes’ opinion in Sorrells and Chief Justice Warren’s opinion in Sherman say basically what we’re talking about is a defense to criminal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.603" offset="5406783">And the basic issue in terms of normal criminal law standards of culpability is, did the intent with which the defendant did the physical acts that in apparent violation of the statute arise on his own or was that criminal design manufactured by the Government?</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.721" offset="5491315">In analogy to standard insanity or duress from the state concept, the man is just not criminally liable or culpable if the Government manufactured the criminal intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.968" offset="5540216">And the Court in both to those cases said, this is consistent with what we would understand the Congressional intent to be, and both Chief Justices said Congress didn’t want its criminal statutes enforced against people who did not intend to violate them until the Government came along.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.442" offset="5614195">The separate opinions of Justice Roberts and Justice Frankfurter put a wholly different cast on it and said, the focus ought to be on whether the conduct of the investigators is tolerable or not irrespective of normal guilt or innocence under criminal law principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.919" offset="5684099">But even those separate opinions and this is basic, state what is to called the objective test rather than the subjective test and it is not the kind of this rule or subjective test that the Court of Appeals applied here terming the conduct intolerable or repugnant or excessive for overzealous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.572" offset="5762675">The standard stated by Justice Frankfurter and we quote the language on page 19 of our main brief is this, this test he says, shifts attention from the record and predisposition of the particular defendant to the conduct of the police and the likelihood objectively considered that it would entrap only those ready and willing to commit the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.002" offset="5864448">It is as -- this has been proposed in the Model Penal Code and the proposed Federal Code and the introduction Senate One in the 93rd Congress which is the official senate bill, Mclellans, Senator Mclellans bill for revamping the whole criminal -- Federal Criminal Code, the test would be an objective one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.588" offset="5946786">Is it likely that the conduct that the agent engaged in might seduce an innocent person into committing a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.742" offset="5979387">If it’s that kind of conduct, we don’t care under this test whether the defendant actually had a criminal design.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.990" offset="6004360">We just won’t allow the Government to engage in that kind of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.013" offset="6020451">If however, it's conduct that would not likely ensnared the innocent as well as the guilty looking only at the agent’s conduct, then there is to be no defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.007" offset="6068412">That’s the objective standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.754" offset="6075413">Now, in this case of course applying that standard, there can be no question, but that objectively considered and offered to someone to supply an ingredient in the manufacture of an illegal drug is not likely to tempt or to seduce the ordinary law abiding citizen about whom Justice Frankfurter was speaking as well into committing the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.644" offset="6166946">These statements by Justice Roberts and Justice Frankfurter came up in the context of cases where it might be thought that a normally law abiding citizen might have fallen from grace because of the over bearing of the Government agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.339" offset="6225774">In Sorrells, it was a request to get some liquor during prohibition for an old army buddy and it might have been thought that normal social behavior might ultimately cause a person, a normally law abiding person to yield and supply a kind of liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.982" offset="6296304">In Sherman of course, the undercover informant attempted another former narcotics addict who was undergoing treatment with him to get him heroine for his personal use saying that he couldn’t suffer the pain of withdrawal and finally, the perspective defendant yielded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.830" offset="6379687">Those are holes apart from the kind of conduct here, which presents no risk in the Frankfurter formulation or the formulation of Model Penal Code, the Federal, Proposed Federal Code or S-1, creates no risk that the Government conduct will ensnare the otherwise innocent or tempt the normally law abiding citizen as in the Federal -- Proposed Federal Code.</text>

            <text syncTime="1704.290" offset="6921571">We have raised in our brief the question whether the creation of this new kind of defense is even an appropriate exercise of judicial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.196" offset="6953232">To the best of our knowledge, neither under the Due Process Clause nor under what is called the Court’s supervisory power over the administration of criminal justice has the Court ever asserted or exercise the power to create a new defense to criminal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.309" offset="7017597">Now, Chief Justice Hughes in the Sorrells’ opinion specifically rejects this proposition, saying the courts have no power once a valid statute applicable according to its construction is involved and the executive chooses to prosecute, the courts have no power to create a new defense to exonerate the defendant which would be the effect of the holding in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.709" offset="7123237">We’ve argued at some length in our brief that whether you regard this as an extension of the entrapment case or as a proposal to establish a new Due Process defense, there’s no basis for doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.912" offset="7176004">Now first of all, the technique here given one of the ingredients to be used in the manufacture of the drug fits within the traditional law enforcement technique which has been reaffirmed by this Court as recently as in Osborn against the United States in 385 U.S. and that is, it is not unlawful entrapment to provide the opportunity or facility for commission of a crime, if the criminal intent which is the underlying premise of criminal prosecution inheres in the defendant before the agent appears on the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.334" offset="7325738">Similarly, there’s no inherent, unfairness here in this kind of activity we believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.276" offset="7349457">I think we’ve shown in our brief that there are countervailing reasons from law enforcement purposes for infiltrating criminal groups, not only drug groups, but organized crime, smuggling and espionage groups, but nothing that was done here violated any specific provision of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.365" offset="7425839">The Court in Hoffa, Osborn and Lewis has specifically rejected Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendment challenges to undercover operations and in Hoffa specifically rejected the notion that this violates the Fifth Amendment Due Process as inherently unfair.</text>

            <text syncTime="1947.600" offset="7894789">But to illustrate Mr. Justice if I may, the -- what I would to call our basic theory is that if the Government provides a fungible commodity, there is no entrapment as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.277" offset="7953512">That would be phenyl-2-propanone here because it could be obtained from other sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.385" offset="7969917">It was difficult to obtain, it would even apply to heroine or the counterfeit bills because if the agent isn’t there infiltrating the scheme, monitoring it by his presence in participation, it’s very probable under the realities of the criminal world that the heroine or the counterfeit bills or the P2P in this case or the gun in your case will come from someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.940" offset="8060197">And that is a legitimate law enforcement objective to stay right close to the transaction, including cooperating with the scheme to the extent necessary in order to track it all the way to the conclusion, to find out all of the participants and then nip it before it goes any further.</text>

            <text syncTime="2661.762" offset="10751436">The second of which is to state that under Sorrells and Sherman, the activities of the Government arise to create of activity and manufacturing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.322" offset="10785708">And the third ground is that under the supervisory prior to this Court to adopt the separate opinion in Sherman and Sorrells, but I do believe that there is a great of question as to the sufficiency of the evidence to carry the issue of entrapment to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.015" offset="10896468">The important facts that I think this Court must pay attention to are for: one, I believe -- first of all is that the proposal to a supply the propanone came from Shapiro.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.025" offset="10976507">Now, Shapiro was the only agent that testified, but there were four or five surveiling agents outside the house at all time; this was wasn’t a one man operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.256" offset="11013392">They knew where they -- that same day determine where the laboratory was, but I think it’s important that the offer to supply came from a Government agent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2756.048" offset="11128539">The second aspect that I think is important in the factual record in this matter is the critical aspect to the chemical involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.795" offset="11155602">This was a catalyst, the propanone and it was impossible to produce Speed without it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.372" offset="11181934">You could have all the laboratory, all the flasks, all the spoons, all the bottles as everything else and without phenyl-2-propanone, you get nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.997" offset="11220386">As a record reflects here and you can have everything else and if you don’t have the propanone, you could not manufacture methamphetamines, answer is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.548" offset="11258629">Without the phenyl-2-propanone, you could not get the reaction to get methamphetamine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.220" offset="11281304">Absent of propanone, you put everything else in there described by Mr. Shapiro, what would you get?</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.758" offset="11311397">And this was a chemist testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.156" offset="11321010">Not a great deal of any kind of products you see because the product depends upon the reaction of phenyl-2-propanone, that is the whole idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.131" offset="11352879">The other things that are in there are simply for solvents or for the generation of hydrogen for condensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.245" offset="11385375">So, this is not as the Government would attempt to characterize, this is just an isolated drug which they just happened to provide.</text>
