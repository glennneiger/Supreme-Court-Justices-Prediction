            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll hear arguments next in 71-839, Erlenbaugh against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.174" offset="316061">Mr. Grubb, you may proceed whenever you are ready now.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles W. Grubb</label>
            <text syncTime="56.934" offset="331107">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.323" offset="348662">I am here under rather ominous position today, faithfully speaking in that when the Travel Act, Section 1952 of Title 18 of United States Code was passed in 1961, I was a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation assigned to Lake County, Indiana, and I had prepared that time the first summary report to be used for the prosecution of people like I am representing today.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.071" offset="475617">This Act is the Travel Act, Section 1952 of Title 18 of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.790" offset="510516">Now the question before this Court today is whether the Seventh Circuit erred in not following the case of U.S. versus Arnold, which was cited in the briefs, treated in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.910" offset="562970">In that case they had treated also Section 1953, which was a companion Section of Section 1952, which is the Travel Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.186" offset="600168">The Court of Appeals, Seventh Court of Appeals, stated and rejected Arnold on the ground that there was lack of precedent and also that there was a lack of reasoning in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.709" offset="650219">Well, this was actually a case of first impression for all practical purposes and, thus, there was a lack of precedent for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.273" offset="692433">But I believe that the study of the legislating history, study of the Acts themselves, and the study of the cases cited by the government and the cases which I shall cite, support Arnold and give reasoning, Arnold was first.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.107" offset="755754">There is no doubt about it, it was the first opinion, but nevertheless I think that we have a proper reason that can be found in these cases and also in the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.932" offset="799117">Now petitioners were convicted under Section 1952, the Travel Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.410" offset="821060">They were horse race bookies and they use what is known as the Illinois Sports News, I don’t believe if we got this in the record pointed out, but this was the Illinois Sports News.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.756" offset="862438">It’s a newspaper published in Chicago, Illinois and is used by bookies, because it contains horse race betting information and predictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.889" offset="910921">This paper was sent to the petitioners who all reside in Lake County, Indiana and so that -- some of them were my informers when I was in the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.693" offset="962121">These persons used this, this paper was sent from Chicago, Illinois to Hammond, Indiana and it was consigned to what was known as the Hammond News Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.665" offset="1010082">These petitioners according to the record went to the Railroad Station and picked up the copies of it dropping, leaving their money there and took the copies and they did use it in their horse racing operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.954" offset="1063163">The Illinois Sport News has been held to be a newspaper and exempt under Section 1953 of Title 18, which is the companion section, and it was so held by the Seventh Circuit which treated this case previously and that was in Kelly versus Illinois Bell Telephone Company, that's a 1963 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.289" offset="1148531">I am giving the citation because there were two Kelly cases that I have in the briefs, 325 F. 2nd. 148 and it was held in a general way by the Seventh Circuit, to be a newspaper and exempt from the operation of Section 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.269" offset="1228466">Now, Congress had a right -- had a reason to exempt newspapers from Section 1953 and that's to protect the right for free press.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.063" offset="1267649">But in passing 1953, it permitted the interstate transportation of a paper carrying with it information, carrying with it gambling information, betting information.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.675" offset="1318118">This information could be used for only one purpose, none but or so a nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.498" offset="1337344">It's worth for anything for anything else except gambling, it’s a betting paper, but Congress permitted this to be passed and they knew it couldn’t be passed and in doing so they knew it, it would be transported for one purpose and that is to use for gambling purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.881" offset="1414875">This is not going to be used to paper walls, it's not going to be use line bureau drawers.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.056" offset="1435564">It's strictly a gambling paper and government made that quite plain in the various trials that we had.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.333" offset="1464717">Now, the cases cited by the government in opposition can be distinguished from the cases before the Court, and also from Arnold, in fact, I think they help to explain Arnold. U.S. versus Miller which is cited in the brief, that's a 1967 case out of Seventh Circuit, once all this began.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.928" offset="1555101">The defendants there subscribed to Western Union Service, the defendants had a ticker, they paid for it, they have it in their gambling joint wherever it was in Lake County, Indiana and they used the information from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.693" offset="1618108">They caused, they did not cause the interstate commerce or cause the use of an interstate facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.416" offset="1640991">They used it, they actually used it, and the case before the Court that these petitioners did not subscribe to any paper, they did not order any paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.889" offset="1682892">They did not cause any direct use of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.826" offset="1698670">The next case is U.S. versus Azar, which is a 1964 case, it’s a District Court case in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.370" offset="1724897">There we had another paper much like the Illinois Sport News, it’s called the Green Sheet and the Green Sheet was published in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.911" offset="1763035">The two defendants in Azar traveled from Detroit, Michigan to Ohio where the paper is published, and there they gave information, which was used in the paper, actually used in the paper, and then the paper was sent across states lines back into Michigan and there the defendants as consignees picked up the paper, they -- the paper was sent to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.304" offset="1872541">They used interstate commerce, they caused its use by being consignees and they also traveled across the state line to add, to give information for publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.029" offset="1919457">It was direct travel in interstate commerce, we did not have it in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.187" offset="1944116">The next case was U.S. versus Ross, a 1967 case and it was in the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.535" offset="1973478">The defendant was a subscriber to what is known as the Angel-Kaplan Sports Publications.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.446" offset="2001168">Now this is similar to the Illinois Sport News I assume.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.561" offset="2017573">Now this was shipped in interstate commerce to the defendant in Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.769" offset="2046412">The defendant admitted in this case that he was a subscriber, he was a subscriber to this paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.198" offset="2068146">It was sent to him directly and he in effect caused the use of interstate commerce which was not true of the defendants -- petitioners in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.149" offset="2107956">And the last case with the government cited was US versus Mendonez (ph) a 1968 case out of the Circuit Court of -- out of Fifth Circuit Court of the Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.433" offset="2153096">The defendants in Florida used the telephone to New York to get the total liabilities of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks and the 12 – the total was to be used that as the winning number in their lottery game here again.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.445" offset="2225194">They used a directly interstate commerce, an interstate facility which is not true of our defendants -- of our petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.225" offset="2268244">Now the Seventh Circuit, back to the Seventh Circuit in United States v. McCormick, a 1971 case 442 F2nd 316.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.028" offset="2311502">The Court spoke differently on the use of interstate facility then in the cases before this Court, spoke entirely differently and I want to bring these cases these two cases to the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.380" offset="2360926">The Court there -- the defendant McCormick, the man in Indianapolis, he advertised in the daily newspaper – in a weekly newspaper for salesmen to be used in his gambling scheme, in his lottery scheme and these salesman, this paper went across the states lines or sent through mails not only through mails but it was sent Indiana interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.048" offset="2443577">And the government urge that this was a sufficient use of interstate -- of an interstate facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.650" offset="2470013">The Seventh Circuit reverse this and said and I would like to read this, just the part of this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.124" offset="2491852">The U.S. versus McCormick and they start out.</text>

            <text syncTime="614.934" offset="2563114">I was about to read from U.S. versus McCormick, that is a case of in all the Seventh Circuit Court and I am reading here from McCormick.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.369" offset="2612851">In Rewis versus US 401 U.S and I will give the correct citation, they did not have it here, it is 28 LED 2nd 493, the Supreme Court reverse the conviction of a gambler whose lottery operation was frequented by our state letters.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.009" offset="2695398">Construing this same Section, the Court emphasized the intent of Congress to strike at the truly interstate operations of organized crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.198" offset="2732178">The Court refused to give broad ranging application to the statute, particularly since Congress gave no indication that it wished to alter the sensitive Federal state relationships, over extend limited Federal police resources or produce situations in which the geographic origins of customers a matters of happen stats would transform relatively minor state offenses into Federal felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.698" offset="2834160">Similarly and I still reading from McCormick, similarly in U.S. versus Altobella, 442 F 2nd 310 also in the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.916" offset="2878986">This Court struck down the conviction of two extortioners under the section 1952 where Jurisdiction was claimed on the basis that the victims' check was cleared by mail between Chicago and Philadelphia stated, “When both use of the interstate facility and the subsequent act is as minimal and incidental as in this case, we do not believe a Federal crime has been committed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="720.244" offset="2984312">The Court then reversed and added in McCormick, “defendant neither used nor caused to be used and the interstate facility as an instrumental part of his illegal operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.523" offset="3037497">We must therefore conclude that no Federal prime was committed and that the state of Indiana is the only appropriate authority to punish the defendant for maintaining this local lottery.</text>

            <text syncTime="910.711" offset="3746252">It is a 401, it is -- this is what was stated in Rewis, “legislative history of the act was limited but does review that 1952 was aimed primarily and organized crime and more specifically at persons who reside in one state while operating or managing illegal activities located in another.</text>

            <text syncTime="956.774" offset="3930467">In conclusion I like to state that here there was no organized crime ever met, no evidence of any organized crime.</text>

            <label>Mr. Allan A. Tuttle</label>
            <text syncTime="1095.419" offset="4485099">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.256" offset="4504430">The 11 petitioners here were convicted on five separate indictments after five separate Jury trials of using and causing the use of and interstate facility, in this case the Chicago South Shore and South Bend Railroad to promote and facilitate the operation of an illegal gambling operation in Hammond, Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.629" offset="4601919">I had thought that the question which this Court had addressed itself to when it granted certiorari was the question of whether since Section 1953 contains a specific exclusion for newspapers, are we to assume that Congress intended to exclude from the scope of the Act an individual who had scratch sheets sent to him through the facilities of interstate commerce and thereafter use the scratch sheets to promote his unlawful activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.822" offset="4734621">As Mr. Grubb has argued the case he seems to me to I have argued a difference case and one on which this Court did not grant certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.434" offset="4753115">One on which jury resolved against these defendants and one which the Court Appeals resolved against these defendants and one which no petition for certiorari was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.062" offset="4807659">Mr. Grub contains -- maintains excuse me that these petitioners did not cause the use of an interstate facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.987" offset="4847365">The Jury was instructed on this question and the Jury returned a verdict finding that these petitioners had in fact caused the use of this railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.566" offset="4881638">The Court of Appeals made the same finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.413" offset="4893027">Indeed it seems to me that Mr. Grubb has conceded the main question in this case, when he says the case is like Ross and Azar are to be distinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.070" offset="4931688">Ross was distinguished by Mr. Grubb just now on the ground that Ross had subscribed to a paper in Chicago and thereby had in fact caused the interstate shipment, but if the question is whether the shipment of these papers through the channels of commerce is a subject of the Travel Act, then in conceding that Ross was properly decided, in my view that concedes the main question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.580" offset="5033671">I might say the same as true of Azar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.551" offset="5045582">In Azar for instance, again, it was an interstate shipment of scratch sheets of the kind that we have in this case, and in Azar, in fact one of the two defendants didn't travel in interstate commerce, one did, the other remained in Detroit and picked up the packages when they reached their destination consigned to a Mr. Williams in Detroit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.018" offset="5139414">Now I will address myself to what I consider to be the question which this Court -- upon which this Court granted certiorari which is the question of the scope of the Travel Act and whether the transportation or causing the transportation of the sheets through the facilities of Interstate Commerce could violate the Travel Act and in the course of stating the facts of the case, I may shed some line on the question which Mr. Grubb has raised, but which I can see or which I contend is not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.930" offset="5259055">The petitioners were owners and operators five separate horse race betting parlors in Hammond, Indiana, each of which was and was conceded to be operated in violation of the laws of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.238" offset="5312345">Now in connection with the operation of these horse race betting parlors, petitioners used a publication known as the Illinois Sports News.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.421" offset="5357066">Mr. Grubb has showed the Court a copy of the Illinois Sports News.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.217" offset="5372217">The sports news is known as the scratch sheet, a scratch as the Court may know, is a horse that has been withdrawn from a race in which it was previously entered and the withdrawal is not reflected perhaps on the afternoon, previous afternoon's racing forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.103" offset="5431777">Therefore, the scratch sheet is of considerable value because it's published at 8 AM in the morning, distributed promptly and can be used by betters in placing their wagers on that day's races.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.930" offset="5475140">Indeed the testimony in this case shows that the scratch sheet was vital to these operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.612" offset="5497814">One convicted co-conspirator who testified for the government, testified that on days when the scratch sheet failed to arrive, business fell off by as much as 80 %.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.712" offset="5538252">There is also evidence that the entire shipment by the month to the Hammond New Agency dropped off drastically after the race in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1427.513" offset="5813373">These petitioners and their co-conspirators by prearrangement with the local news agency, the Hammond News Agency, arranged to pick up their copies of the Illinois Sports News at approximately 9:02 in the morning when the 8:30 train from the Randolph Street Station in Chicago, Illinois arrived with these scratch sheets on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.573" offset="5901667">The petitioners would then take their scratch sheets and distribute them to their various horse race betting parlors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.499" offset="5925386">Now there are many copies that arrived everyday consigned to the Hammond News Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.012" offset="5943463">Approximately 57 were picked up and used by the co-conspirators in this – in these five separate cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.971" offset="5971257">Mr Goodman (ph) whom I have mentioned testified for the Government picked up 22 copies a day to use in his gambling operations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1488.151" offset="6055999">Does that mean that it's quite an expensive item?</text>

            <label>Mr. Allan A. Tuttle</label>
            <text syncTime="1490.617" offset="6065821">As a matter of fact, they are, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.876" offset="6074911">At the time of the trial, they were $00.35 a piece.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.631" offset="6085883">Now much of the same information is -- can be obtained from other papers, but this is this which contains no information except racing information is more expensive because of its rapidity of distribution and fact that you can get it early, you can place your bets early.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.661" offset="6150040">But my point of indicating the arrangement for payment was in a way to allude indirectly the question of causation because in this case there was an arrangement to receive 22 copies a day and to pay for them on a weekly basis to the Hammond News Agency which was the consignee of these papers from Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.840" offset="6222764">The other 35 which were picked by the co-conspirators were picked up at 9 o'clock in the morning and they left envelops of cash at the train station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.735" offset="6262262">Later on in the morning in the ordinary course of business, employees of the Hammond News Agency would come, pick up the remaining 33 copies and distribute them to various retail outlets around the Hammond area and they would hit the news stance around 11 -- 10:30 or 11, much later of course than these petitioners had it and had it for use in their betting parlors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.727" offset="6362258">Now as I have suggested the question is whether the exclusion of these papers from 1953 entails a similar exclusion from 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.133" offset="6399875">The statute in this case, the Travel Act, provides and I will read if the Court will indulge me, the relevant part of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.857" offset="6430804">The statute provides whoever uses any facility in interstate commerce would be intent and then in subparagraph 3, to promote, manage, carry on, establish, or facilitate the promotion, management, or establishment, or carrying on, of any unlawful activity, and thereafter performs any act, specified in subparagraph 3 which I have just read you, violates the Travel Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.525" offset="6537488">And then the statute defines an unlawful act and significantly it defines it as a business activity, a business enterprise involving gambling, gambling offenses in violation of the laws of the State in which they were committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.242" offset="6600391">Now the Congressional hearings reflect a concern that otherwise lawful or innocent interstate travel was being used to facilitate illegal gambling and I stress illegal gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.865" offset="6658800">As you know the Travel Act prescribes interstate travel with a purpose to promote other violations of State Law such as narcotics violations, liquor violations, prostitution violations, extortion, arson, extortion and bribery and that has been amended to include arson and controlled substances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.440" offset="6733093">But at the time of the hearings, when Attorney General Kennedy testified on behalf of this legislation, the stress was on gambling and the fact that $20,000,000,00 a year changed hands in gambling and gambling was a prime source of funds for the underworld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.415" offset="6801011">Indeed his examples all involved gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.972" offset="6811251">He spoke for example of moving the proceeds of an illegal gambling operation in one state to another state or he spoke for example of the interstate and nationwide travel of layoff men, which indicated gambling operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.719" offset="6882200">Now if Congress was concerned with otherwise lawful travel which might be the subject of promoting an unlawful or illegal activity and violation of state law, Congress was equally careful not to make innocent interstate travel the subject of criminal sanctions, and it was senator Erwin (ph) who stressed this and senator Erwin stated that he would hate to see the time come when this country would make it a crime to travel, having certain thoughts, as he conceived that this act could make it a crime simply that you would be thinking something while you are traveling interstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.046" offset="7019604">And in reaction to senator Erwin's concern, the judiciary committee amended the law and they added a second proviso, they provided as in the overt act requirement in conspiracy cases, they provided the act of the interstate travel, the individual do something which promotes the unlawful activity, thereby assuring that the statute would involve any kind of thought control or punish somebody merely for their thoughts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.784" offset="7122526">Now the statute was also limited to be sure not to apply to the individual gambler who might be traveling interstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.920" offset="7159097">Even if he traveled interstate with the intent to engage in illegal gambling and thereafter in fact engaged in illegal gambling, the statute wouldn't cover such activity as Attorney General Kennedy stressed when he testified in support of this legislation that the target was organized crime and the statute had been drafted to cover only what was called travel in furtherance of “business enterprises” so that no casual or sporadic involvement in gambling activities would be covered, but only such regular and continuous conduct as might be classified as a business enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.663" offset="7314056">In this way, travel in interstate commerce even with an unlawful purpose in mind is not covered unless it is followed by some kind of overt act after the travel which promotes the unlawful activity, and of course the same language makes it equally clear or doubly plain that innocent interstate travel could never be the subject of any sanction under this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.129" offset="7403917">Now of course there is nothing novel about Congress making interstate travel for an unlawful purpose, the subject of a criminal sanction and criminal responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.479" offset="7445295">It is after all no crime to travel interstate with a woman, but in fact travelers for the purposes of prostitution, the Mann Act is violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.225" offset="7484270">Similarly, it is no crime to travel interstate with a child, but if the child is held for ransom and reward, the Limbard (ph) Law is violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.209" offset="7524185">The mails are available to anyone, but if the mails are used in furtherance of a scheme to the fraud, the Mail Fraud Statute is violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.052" offset="7563577">By the same token, anyone can use the telephone, make a long distance telephone call, or anyone can equally send a telegram interstate, but if these facilities are used to further an unlawful activity, then the legitimate objects for Congressional concern and Congressional regulation, and as this Court knows, a classic violation of the Travel Act is the use of the interstate wires to convey betting information, wagers or rational results.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.623" offset="7697847">Now just this gambling information can be sent interstate to gamblers over the wires, so the morning line in the Illinois Sports News can be sent interstate to promote illegal gambling operations and this fact no more inhibits the lawful movement of the Illinois Sports News, then the Mann Act or the Limbard Law inhibits the interstate travel of woman or children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.183" offset="7808084">Now in our view, Section 1953 achieves its result of avoiding criminal responsibility for innocent conduct by an entirely different route.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.689" offset="7862105">Section 1953 defines a class of contraband, the interstate shipment of which is banned irrespective of the purpose for which it is sent or the motive for which it is sent or the use to which it is put, after it is sent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.269" offset="7924485">Section 1953 defines gambling paraphernalia in very broad language, including any slip, token, paper, writing, or other device designed or adapted for use in book making or wagering on sports activities or numbers operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.016" offset="8007450">It was this broad language which the senator Keating (ph) in the hearings on the bill to express concerning that you or I or anyone else might commit a crime under the 1953 provision by traveling from here to New York carrying a copy of the Post because it might happen to contain the results of a sporting activity or the results of a horse race.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.665" offset="8102013">And it was in response to this concern that Congress amended the statute to say “this Section shall not apply the carriage or transportation in interstate commerce of any newspaper or similar publication, and we concede for the purposes of this argument in any event that the scratch sheet would qualify under that subsection.</text>

            <text syncTime="2040.816" offset="8266585">Now Congress recognized that otherwise innocent travel or movement in interstate commerce could in fact be the subject of criminal responsibility, whether the requisite intend was present and where they were overt acts in furtherance of the unlawful activity following that interstate travel or movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.728" offset="8366268">We see no reason to assume that Congress intended that one particular kind of innocent act, in this case, the transportation by rail of newspapers should be excluded from the subject of criminal responsibility if and only if the requisite purpose is there and overt act is there following the interstate movement or the causing of the interstate movement.</text>
