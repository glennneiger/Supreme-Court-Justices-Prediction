            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="25.982" offset="207287">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.946" offset="219199">In this case like the one which is just been argued, the Government is appealing from a judgment of the District Court for the District of Columbia, enjoining enforcement of a provision of the Food Stamp Act on constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.898" offset="274996">Provision in question is another 1971 Amendment to the Act, this one is commonly referred to as the tax dependent amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.924" offset="311045">Generally speaking, the amendment provides the household of the young adult was claimed by his parents as a tax dependent is not eligible to participate in the food stamp program if his parents themselves do not qualify for food stamp assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.500" offset="381367">Now I might add at this point that in order to take a child as a dependent for tax purposes, the parent must provide over one half of the child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.107" offset="423790">The eight individual appellees here brought this suit as a class action alleging that they had been excluded from participation in the food stamp program solely by virtue of the operation of the tax dependent amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.660" offset="481991">Appellees raise no question of statutory interpretation in this case and they did not contest the applicability of the statute to their individual cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.349" offset="520756">They sought declaratory and injunctive relief solely on constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.510" offset="545416">The three-judge court held the provision unconstitutional, without closely analyzing the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.989" offset="575300">The Court assumed that it necessarily acted to deny food stamps on the valid of -- on the basis of invalid taxpayer dependency claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.269" offset="612498">Court considered this result to be so grossly unfair, in the Court’s terms, as to constitute both the denial of due process and of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.068" offset="651682">Court therefore enjoined further enforcement in implementation of the tax dependent amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.532" offset="677491">As we have discussed at some length in our reply brief, this case presents a threshold question whether adjudication of appellees’ constitutional claims as appropriated at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.685" offset="726079">It now appears that each named appellee may have been denied food stamps solely as a consequence of errors in the administrative interpretation of the tax dependent amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.377" offset="772890">We have set forth our analysis of the statutory issues in our reply brief and I will not discuss them at length here, but stated very briefly five of the appellees in this case were denied food stamp assistance on the basis solely of invalid tax payer dependency claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="186.201" offset="848227">Mr. Keith is there an administrative remedy provided for any improper income tax dependency claim?</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="195.319" offset="884694">No there isn’t and it has been the administrative interpretation of this Act that it does deny food stamps, if the claim of an injunction is made and there's no inquiry into it whether it is valid or invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.454" offset="945194">That has been the administrative interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.591" offset="957733">As we point out in our reply briefs, the statute certainly made but it doesn’t have to be interpreted in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.688" offset="990124">The other three appellees in this --</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="223.046" offset="995558">That would be then, the applicants are helpless aren't they in the face of a -- an invalidly asserted dependency claim?</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="232.597" offset="1033801">If the statute is construed as denying food stamps on the basis of an invalid claim, then there is no way for the applicant to establish that their claims is in fact -- that that the tax payer claim was in fact invalid and if they should receive food stamps, that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.290" offset="1104541">The statutory language talks merely in terms of “is claimed” and whether that imports a requirement of validity is an open question I would think at this time --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="261.670" stopTime="265.297">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="261.670" offset="1150098">Well, does that concern you at all?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="keith_a_jones" startTime="265.297" stopTime="418.461">
            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="265.297" offset="1164518">Well it concerns me in the sense that we have pointed out to the Court that this Court has frequently interpreted statutes so as to avoid constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.725" offset="1206314">If it were the opinion of Court that the statute would be invalid as so construed as denying food stamps on the basis of invalid claims then it would be appropriate for the Court to interpret it as not denying food stamps in such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.481" offset="1269321">And I think that such an interpretation would generally accord with the statutory language, and would not do a violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.303" offset="1296593">On the other hand, we have argued that even if it is construed as denying food stamps on the basis of invalid claims, the statute is nevertheless constitutional and that we would advance two reasons for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.625" offset="1357824">In the first place, Congress could assume that such invalid claims are going to be comparatively rare.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.165" offset="1384051">There are civil and criminal penalties for false filing of tax returns and surely in almost all cases this will deter false dependency claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.437" offset="1421145">Now, furthermore, one of the purposes of the tax dependent amendment was one of the underlying rationales for the tax dependent amendment was that through the granting of a tax dependency deduction, Congress is already providing support, is already making in a sense a payment towards the support of the tax dependent and that payment is made whether or not claims is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.577" offset="1537651">So that for example, if food stamps were issued to a dependent or to an applicant and then those food stamps were stolen, the Government presumably would not be required to reissue food stamps on a basis of private theft of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.051" offset="1603584">Similarly we would feel that equal protection would not require the Government to step in and take care of dependents who have falsely claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.622" offset="1649873">The other three appellees in the case as we say were granted -- Oh! Excuse, were denied food stamps after they have moved out of their parent’s households and established their own households.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.581" offset="1701700">And as we have set forth in our reply brief, it is not our understanding that food stamps should be denied in such a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.748" offset="1738376">We’ve discussed the statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.417" offset="1749034">We believe that these three appellees apparently were erroneously denied food stamps.</text>

            <text syncTime="458.718" offset="1938265">Well, we have not conceded however that the statute denies or grants food stamps when the taxpayer dependency claim is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.391" offset="1980897">We would not issue food stamps in such a case, however, as I point out in order to save the statute if it were necessary to do so, the Court will construe the statute otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.026" offset="2027499">But in short as we point out, these appellees may well be entitled to relief on purely statutory grounds in which case it would not be necessary for this Court to reach the constitutional claims.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="493.752" offset="2078386">That sounds pretty much like the argument in the previous case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="keith_a_jones" startTime="498.629" stopTime="828.125">
            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="498.629" offset="2097925">Well, they are related cases which this Court took together.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.125" offset="2111822">I turn now from these threshold matters to a discussion of the constitutional issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.384" offset="2136900">The appellees’ principal challenge to the statute is on grounds of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.190" offset="2160097">In the standard of reviewing equal protection cases or cases involving equal protection challenges to welfare classifications is by now well established.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.511" offset="2201370">A welfare classification such as the one involved here, must be upheld if it furthers any reasonable purpose which maybe attributed to the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.987" offset="2239300">As this Court reiterated last month in Ortwein against Schwab and in the last term in Richardson against Belcher and Jefferson against Hackney, a legislative allocation of welfare benefits maybe sustained, must be sustained if it is shown that the allocation has a reasonable basis and we believe that this tax dependent amendment does have such a reasonable basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.095" offset="2335744">As a matter it was added to the Food Stamp Act, only after Congress had acquired several years experience with the administration of food stamp program.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.616" offset="2373883">And during those years it had become apparent that although the program generally upgraded in a satisfactory manner, it was subject to some abuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.474" offset="2413275">By 1970, many Congressmen fear that unless these abuses could somehow be eliminated, the whole program might be terminated as a result of rising political opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.956" offset="2459146">One of the most significant abuses at least in the minds of many Congressmen was the obtaining and use of food stamps by the college-age children of higher income families and the tax dependent amendment represents the Congressional response to this general problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.716" offset="2530200">The underlying premises of this amendment are that the food stamp program was not intended to provide welfare assistance to college students and other young adults who are being supported by parents who are financially better off.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.783" offset="2582549">And also, that when these parents receive a tax benefit for supporting their children, they have assumed the primary responsibility for making certain that that support is adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.797" offset="2626539">In short, through the tax deduction the Government has already in essence paid for the support of these young people.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.788" offset="2654542">It needn’t provide food stamps as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.668" offset="2666036">So the effect of the amendment is to restrict the coverage of the food stamp program to low income households which have no apparent access to substantial parental support and with respect to which no higher income family is obtaining a tax benefit and we submit that Congress had the right to choose to go this far and no further in the provision of food stamp assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.693" offset="2766137">Appellees’ equal protection argument apparently is based on the general claim that even if this statute was generally effective in eliminating the abuses with which Congress was concerned, it’s nevertheless unconstitutional insofar as it denies food stamps to certain needy households.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.671" offset="2846072">We concede that some needy households maybe denied of food stamps, but we don’t invest that fact of constitutional significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.686" offset="2882121">First, I think it’s appropriate to point out that the appellees seem to have exaggerated the effect of this amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.521" offset="2909497">They propound a variety of hypothetical cases, but they fail to show that the amendment will in fact bar assistance to significant numbers of needy households.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.950" offset="2947218">To the contrary, Congress could recently assume the very few truly poor households containing young adult who in fact is receiving more than half of his support from a parent who is not himself poor, Congress could determine that parents who receive the tax benefits with dependency exemption, have assumed and are fulfilling their responsibility to support their children.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.402" offset="3036975">Secondly, a welfare classification such as this one is not unconstitutional simply because it doesn’t reach all persons who had benefit from welfare assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.711" offset="3078248">As this Court has often noted, a welfare classification need not be made with mathematical precision.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.703" offset="3106147">Thus in this case, if the food stamp program fails to reach all needy households which have no access to parental support, it’s not for that reason alone unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.206" offset="3156198">Finally, Congress can limit the coverage of a welfare program by the use of non-need eligibility criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.663" offset="3185977">It needn't restrict itself to the use of need as the sole eligibility criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.664" offset="3210010">Given that many necessary physical restraints on welfare expenditures, Congress could reasonably determine that if children of higher income parents, when the parents themselves are enjoying tax benefits from supporting their children or needy that’s primarily the responsibility of the parents and perhaps also the children if they're voluntarily unemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.162" offset="3304051">But it’s not necessarily, it’s not constitutionally the responsibility of the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1186.901" offset="4851022">Tax dependent household has a higher income parent who receives a tax benefit for assuming a responsibility of supporting his child in the tax dependent household.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.498" offset="4893341">Other households have no such advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.814" offset="4902640">Congress could reasonably discriminate between these households as it has done in the (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.735" offset="4926360">Appellees raised one other constitutional claim which they raise in terms of procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.931" offset="4951124">They contend that the amendment amounts to an arbitrary presumption that they’re not needy and they would like to have a hearing to show that they’re needy, but the statutory criteria do not include need as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.000" offset="5003368">For example, statute makes no pretense of providing or attempting to provide all needy persons with nutritional assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.014" offset="5035447">For example, most households without cooking facilities are denied any assistance under the Act, no matter how needy they may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.247" offset="5072332">Congress was not concerned with the need in enacting this amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.822" offset="5086647">It was concerned with the problem of the double benefit involved with tax dependents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.156" offset="5107963">Therefore, we feel that this purported procedural due process in question is really just a broad claim that Congress may not establish eligibility criteria based on any considerations other than need alone and such a claim has nothing to do with procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.677" offset="5174105">If anything, it would be a substantive due process claim that the Congress -- this Court has long since rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.027" offset="5199496">But insofar as it could be viewed as an equal protection claim then it’s clearly erroneous because as this Court settled in Dandridge against Williams, the Equal Protection Clause does not prohibit the use of welfare eligibility criteria based on factors other than need.</text>

            <text syncTime="1309.424" offset="5341080">Appellees would just like to seek averted decision on the constitutionality on the statute because they say that the statute was improperly administered rather than the statute itself violates equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.371" offset="5400848">In order to do this, they raise two new interpretations of the statute, interpretations of the statute that differ from the way they interpreted the statute in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.458" offset="5437210">In fact, interpretation that is different from the way they interpret the Act currently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.411" offset="5457063">They say that a fraudulent tax claim may not necessarily disqualify people in a dependent household.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.254" offset="5492381">Well, Your Honors, it’s absolutely clear that the statute itself disqualifies a household containing a dependent even if that dependent was claimed fraudulently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.828" offset="5538670">If you look at the statute; the statute says very clearly, “any household which includes a member who has reached his 18th birthday and who is claimed as a dependent child for federal income tax purposes by a taxpayer who is not a member of an eligible household shall be ineligible to participate in any food stamp program, established pursuant to this chapter during the tax period such dependency is claimed and for a period of one year after expiration of such period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.280" offset="5676492">Appellants admit that their reading of the statute is that a fraudulently claimed dependency household is eliminated from the food stamp program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.094" offset="5715780">In fact, that’s the way they currently administer the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.285" offset="5728528">If this case were reverse, this is precisely the way the program would continue to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.015" offset="5751411">Appellants forget that a Court should deference to administrating agency's interpretation of the statute and this is precisely the way that the Department of Agriculture interprets the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.081" offset="5795715">Their regulations eliminate fraudulently claimed dependent households.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.053" offset="5811597">Their instructions eliminate fraudulently claimed dependent households.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.932" offset="5827062">In fact, the acting administrator of the Food &amp; Nutrition Service, Mr. Howard Davis, in his affidavit and you’ll find that on page 83 of the appendix, he says, “There are no factual issues to be presented or challenged other than the issue of whether of not a member of the household has been claimed as a dependent child.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.310" offset="5916609">In fact, appellant’s argument in the District Court was that it is illegal to check into the tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.875" offset="5942836">They said that disclosure to the dependent or to the food stamp office as to whether the claim was proper or improper is impermissible under the tax statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.131" offset="5979930">You’ll find that statement in appendix B to our brief, pages 22B through 24B.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.247" offset="6008351">However, even if this Court wanted to fictionalize the interpretation of the statute and change the way this agency, the Department of Agriculture has interpreted this provision from the outset, it would still be five appellees at the very least who would still be harmed by the operation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.225" offset="6084315">Appellees Alderete, appellee Murry, appellee Valdez, appellee Broderson, appellee Schultz.</text>

            <text syncTime="1645.768" offset="6686490">However, if you look at the statute, the statute is very clear on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.798" offset="6702582">Look at Section 2016 (c) of Title 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.568" offset="6717628">It says, “the value of the coupon allotment provided to any eligible household which is in excess of the amount charged such households for such allotment shall not be considered to be income or resources for any purpose under federal or state laws including but not limited to laws relating to taxation, welfare and public assistance programs.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.369" offset="6808848">The only provision that the appellant cite to the contrary is a tax ruling which they cite at page 3, note 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.287" offset="6840508">That ruling however has absolutely no application to that case -- to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.587" offset="6861720">That ruling merely refers to “state benefit payments measured solely by a recipient’s needs.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.781" offset="6890454">These are not state welfare benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.733" offset="6898291">These are federal benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.517" offset="6905396">All of the benefits are subsidized by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.296" offset="6920547">At the very least Your Honors there are five appellees who are not harmed because of the wrongful administration of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.128" offset="6951894">They are harmed because of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.921" offset="6967045">Appellants' other new statutory interpretation is that they say for the provision to operate, you do not have to have been outside the taxpayer claimants house during part of the tax year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.832" offset="7018663">They say if you are outside of the household, during the carryover year, the year after the period for which the tax dependency was claimed, but you were not outside of the household during the period for the tax dependency claim, then you should not have been denied food stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.856" offset="7090761">However, even if this new statutory interpretation was accepted by the Court, every single one of the appellees in this case would still be operate -- would still be harmed by the operation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.278" offset="7140498">It is clear that this case is not moot, it’s a very live controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.162" offset="7160038">Turning to the merits of this case, it’s clear that this provision was designed to eliminate non-needy households from the food stamp program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.938" offset="7195146">However, the tax dependency provision is not reasonably related to that purpose at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.299" offset="7216567">As district judge Hart said, he said that, “Eliminating the voluntary poor from the program or those people who have access to a nutritional adequacy, that operation really required the utilization of a surgeon scalpel.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.600" offset="7273723">And what was done with the statute was Congress wound up using a meat cleaver and started eliminating the needy people from the program, not the un-needy from the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.125" offset="7311862">The statute completely missed in its statutory objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.500" offset="7337357">The tax dependency provision is wholly unrelated to an assessment of a household’s current needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.375" offset="7368913">Although the entire food stamp program operates on the basis of current circumstances, the provision is not at all related to what one's current circumstances actually are, but the program works on the basis of current circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1866.595" offset="7569742">Certification periods are essentially three months under the program and the purpose of that is to make sure that there is an assessment of what the current circumstances of a household are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.252" offset="7612374">If you were illegible on the basis of current income or if you were -- if you have current resources that make you needy then you are illegible for the food stamp program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.471" offset="7657305">Similarly, even if you refused to qualify under the work requirement previously if you are now willing to comply with the work requirement you are ineligible for food stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.821" offset="7698683">Clearly, the program operates on the basis of current circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.752" offset="7718431">Well, this provision is not at all related to an assessment of an individual’s current need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.715" offset="7742255">In fact, contrary to what the appellants have indicated, this provision operates on the basis of a tax dependency claim that is made in April or March of the tax year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.054" offset="7795545">In fact, they so indicated you’ll find that in the appendix at page 81, when they gave an example of how the provision operates and you’ll also see that’s the way they claim the way provision operates and that’s in our appendix to the brief, appendix 17B.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.549" offset="7869524">What happens is, you are denied food stamps on the basis of a tax dependency claim that is made in April or March subsequent to the period of the tax year for which you are making the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.293" offset="7924590">Consequently, when the claim is made the tax year is already over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.976" offset="7943293">The period is an entire nullity with regard to the tax year for which the dependency claim was made. You have received food stamps during that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.260" offset="7980387">In other words, the provision only operates during the subsequent year, the so-called carryover year and the provision rigidly denies you food stamps during the year after the period for which the dependency claim was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.819" offset="8038693">In fact, all of the appellees in this case were denied assistance during the carryover year, not the year for which the dependency claim was made but during the carryover year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.058" offset="8079653">In fact, every one is essentially affected exclusively during the carryover year and the tax dependency claim has absolutely no relationship to what is occurring in that carryover year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.956" offset="8123225">At best, it has some relationship to what happened during the preceding year for which that the tax dependency claim was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.263" offset="8152377">But Your Honors, I think what is even more important is that a tax dependency claim has absolutely no correlation to a household’s actual availability of income and that’s because under the tax dependency provision, there is no minimum support that need be provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.221" offset="8224266">You only need to provide over 50% of your income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.999" offset="8239417">In other words, if a household has absolutely no income at all and the taxpayer gave one dollar to that household then the taxpayer has a right to make a tax dependency claim for that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.849" offset="8290722">Despite the fact that that household has only one dollar of income for that entire year, they are denied food stamps because they were taken as a tax dependent and in fact properly so because they gave over 50% of the income if that household has absolutely no access to nutritional adequacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.487" offset="8365328">For non-students, this provision is entirely arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.797" offset="8382568">In order to be declared a tax dependent, a non-student must have income under $750.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.972" offset="8411303">If a non-student has income over $750, you cannot claim them as a tax dependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.205" offset="8436172">Consequently, if you were -- if you gave more than $750.00, you can declare a non-student as a tax dependent and you can see if you accumulate that -- the student’s income or the non-students’ income and the amount provided by the taxpayer, it still provides you far short of the standards of need that are established by the appellants on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.523" offset="8529481">Take as an example, the six-person eligibility standard under the food stamp program.</text>

            <text syncTime="2588.119" offset="10455855">In Shapiro v. Thompson, you also indicated that that provision, the one year durational residence requirement would’ve been invalid even under the traditional equal protection standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="3132.940" offset="12635094">Yes Mr. Justice Stewart and therefore, those households are different from households for which no tax exemption is provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.533" offset="12681488">Congress was concerned about the problem of double benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.064" offset="12695594">Appellees pay no attention to this problem and insist that the statute has no rational basis because some needy people are eliminated, but the rational basis is the problem of double benefit which Congress understandably went into limit or eliminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.764" offset="12766438">Furthermore, I would point out that appellees in their briefs in here have simply and flatly misstated the application of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.369" offset="12804890">A tax dependent’s household is denied food stamps during the year of the tax dependency claim and not just for the following year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.602" offset="12845746">There is a carryover provision. Congress believed that filing of the tax return would certainly be corroborative evidence and could be used in furthering the purposes of this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.915" offset="12890990">It could presume that parental support under most circumstances would be continued but the primary denial of benefits is during the year of the dependency claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="3212.214" offset="12952221">If for example, the parent says during the year in which the applicant first comes to the administration that no, I’m not claiming my son as a dependent and then he files a tax return in the following year claiming the son is dependent then it’s unlikely quite frankly that he’ll be caught unless there is a spot check or a thorough check of the returns of such parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.189" offset="13060159">Enforcement system obviously would not be perfect but a mechanism which would be checking through the tax returns.</text>
