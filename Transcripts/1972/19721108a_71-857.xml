            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We’ll hear arguments next in 71-857, Evco against Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.524" offset="273429">Mr. Schlenker you may proceed whenever you’re ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kendall O. Schlenker</label>
            <text syncTime="46.693" offset="290147">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, the case of Evco v. Jones is before the Court the second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.511" offset="349393">The issue is whether the gross receipts of Evco from sales of tangible personal property to customers outside the State of New Mexico where delivery is made outside the State of New Mexico are exempt from the New Mexico Emergency School Tax and the Gross Receipts Tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.364" offset="432880">New Mexico of course is a State which is not a heavily industrial state and as a result perhaps of the Atomic Energy Commission and some of the other government agencies and instrumentalities, in our state there have evolved a number of businesses which deal in scientific and technological materials of which Evco is one.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.061" offset="551581">Now, Evco designs educational programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.012" offset="583450">Its customers are many government agencies for the state and federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.359" offset="604766">It does a certain contract work for the Bureau of Indian Affairs and typical of the kind of work it does, which is involved in this case is the designing of instructional programs for the IBM Corporation up in Endicott, New York for its use in training people how to use its typewriters, magnetic tapes, electric typewriters, and other modern types of business equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.632" offset="717928">The products which evolved from this work, which Evco does consists of camera-ready copies of books and training manuals, film strips for instruction and audio tapes.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.567" offset="785638">Now, this case arises under two different New Mexico statutes and for our purposes, I believe it can be considered the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.278" offset="824508">The first one was the so-called Emergency School Tax Act which came about in 1939 and continued along until about 1961 when we changed the name to the New Mexico Gross Receipts Tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.046" offset="883545">The practical effect of those taxes is the same and in each case an exemption was contained from the tax for sales of tangible personal property to government agencies and instrumentalities and to certain nonprofit corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.306" offset="960554">In this case, in the lower court’s opinion, typical of this were the sales to the U.S. for service into the University of Toledo and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.098" offset="1003813">Now, the first issue involved in this case initially was whether Evco was actually selling tangible personal property or whether it was in fact selling a service, which was not subject to this exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.255" offset="1072358">The New Mexico Emergency School Tax contained no provision regarding interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.456" offset="1101197">The New Mexico Gross Receipts Tax provides an exemption in the case of sales which were an interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.478" offset="1129305">Notwithstanding this absence of a provision in New Mexico Emergency School Tax, I don’t believe anyone has ever contended that New Mexico -- that the presence of this provision one way or another would have any effect since, I think it’s always been fairly clear that if these sales are in interstate commerce that they would be just exempt as they are stated to be under the gross receipts tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.615" offset="1225853">The New Mexico Court of Appeals decided that Evco was selling tangible personal property which took care of a considerable part to this case, that relating to sales to the Government and sales to these tax-exempt institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.117" offset="1299832">However, the Court of Appeals decided that notwithstanding their determination that tangible personal property was involved, these sales where delivery was made to IBM for example in New York were not exempt as being in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.405" offset="1393037">We came to this Court before and petition for writ of certiorari and the New Mexico Attorney General’s Office at that time filed a brief, which -- in which it was stated that so far as a second point was concerned that the state would now agree that the sales were exempt as being in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.853" offset="1498781">They expressed their dissatisfaction with the determination still about the services versus tangible personal property point.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.886" offset="1538905">This Court sent the case back in using language in the view of the attorney -- their New Mexico Attorney General’s position or concession that the case was being resubmitted for reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.386" offset="1608913">And in effect what the New Mexico Court of Appeals said was that we have reconsidered but we don’t we change our mind on this point and we again came back with the petition this time which was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.443" offset="1665128">The State raises this point about the tangible personal property versus services, but the state’s position on the second point is that if this is the sale of tangible personal property that we are correct in our position that these sales are exempt as being in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.174" offset="1752064">We rely on the case of Adams Manufacturing Company versus Storen in which the sales there involved were so-called out-shipments and which this Court determined that those sales were exempt as being an interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="1713.407" offset="6957014">The Court of Appeals stated in the first opinion that -- the regarding the issue of services versus tangibles said the adoption of the possession taken by the commissioner would result in an augment imposition of taxes such as those here involved upon agencies and institutions which the legislature intended should be exempt their file or result in a tax burden being shifted to other taxable customers of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.566" offset="7081671">Neither of these results would be consistent with the legislative intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.309" offset="7152619">In support of the statement, the Court of Appeals cited another Court of Appeals case, New Mexico Electric Service Company versus Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.655" offset="7197968">The reasoning that resulted in the statement I’ve read seems to be that if the Commissioner’s decision and order with respect to the issue of service versus tangible personal property have been affirmed by their Court of Appeals, the effect would be a denial of equal protection to taxpayers performance services for the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.287" offset="7320534">The New Mexico Electric Service Company case which was cited by the Court of Appeals raised issues under both the equal protection provisions of the United States and the New Mexico constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.209" offset="7408201">Respondent contends that this reasoning of the New Mexico Court of Appeals regarding a requirements of equal protection is erroneous because the imposition of the tax was on the seller and there was no showing that sellers or services to these agencies or organizations has a class that sellers ask class were treated differently for purposes of taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.304" offset="7528573">If the imposition of the taxes at issue here is on receipts from the performance of services rather than receipts from the sale of tangible personal property, the respondent contends that the tax is not repugnant to the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.481" offset="7605269">And that seems to be the basis for part of the New Mexico Court of Appeal’s decision with regard to that first issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2627.322" offset="10612694">Section 7216 (a) 14.12 came in after the period involving this assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.289" offset="10648534">Now, that deduction provides for deduction for services performed in New Mexico when an initial use of the product of the services is outside New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.152" offset="10707989">However, the buyer outside New Mexico is required to deliver a non-taxable transaction certificate regarding these sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.204" offset="10748217">So, if this matter had come up under current law and a certificate had been issued then the sale would’ve been deductible from a gross receipts tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.346" offset="10848737">Respondent submits that there was error of law present in the decision in New Mexico Court of Appeals on the first point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.826" offset="10898683">That error presented to federal question on the ground that the states statute was held repugnant to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, I have been over that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.991" offset="10943300">Even if it is decided that in New Mexico Court of Appeals did not completely decide the first issue on the grounds that the state statutes were repugnant to the Equal Protection Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment of United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.672" offset="11002023">The decision does not present -- does present an uncertainly as was present in Minnesota versus National Tea Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.784" offset="11050506">Respondent submits that if ambiguity is present that ambiguity should be resolved before the interstate commerce question is considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.997" offset="11099408">If the first issue of the case was decided on incorrect grounds that the exemption or deduction provisions which were limited to receipts from selling tangible personal property were repugnant to the Equal Protection Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, then the issue could be resolve as a question of fact rather than a question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.623" offset="11197837">There were facts which would substantially support the Commissioner of Revenue’s decision that the transactions which resulted in the tax were found the performance of services if it’s a fact question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.846" offset="11262725">If it is decided that the first issue was decided as a matter of state law or that the issue was clearly decided on both federal grounds and state grounds then respondent agrees with petitioner as to the decision on the Court of Appeals on the second point which concerns the application of the Commerce Clause Article 1 of Section 8 of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.087" offset="11403682">The decision of this Court in Freeman versus Hewit and J.D. Adams Manufacturing Company versus Storen hold that if there is a risk of a double tax burden, the tax would be forbidden under the Commerce Clause and that this would so even if apportionment was accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.510" offset="11493439">The reason we think this is the rule is because the destination state could imposed a use or compensating tax on a full value of the Adams when they came to rest in the destination state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.285" offset="11568462">The destination state could also impose as an alternative and oppose the gross receipts tax on the receipts from the subsequent sale of Adams if the seller had sufficient contact with destination study as was done in General Motors versus Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.545" offset="11645576">Respondents emphasize that our contention is that the risk of a double tax burden is all what is required to forbid the tax on receipts from an out-shipment of tangible personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.632" offset="11701896">This we think is clear from the following statement and in J.D. Adams case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.622" offset="11737840">The statement reads the vice of the statute as applied to receipts from interstate sales is that the tax includes in its measure without apportionment receipts derived from activities in interstate commerce and that the exemption is a such a character that if lawful in may in substance be laid to the fullest extent by States in which the goods are sold as well as those in which they are manufactured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.808" offset="11870647">Interstate commerce would thus be subjected to the risk of a double tax burden on which interstate -- interstate commerce would then be subjected to the risk of a double tax burden to which intrastate commerce is not exposed and which the Commerce Clause forbids.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.199" offset="11956120">The Adam’s case distinguishes a gross receipts tax on out-shipments from a tax on manufacturing measured by gross receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.498" offset="11993318">The taxes at issue here are clearly not taxes imposed on the activity of manufacturing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.451" offset="12033128">In this case there was no showing in the record and no argument that there was a possibility of another state taxing or attempting to tax any receipts from the activities incident to the performance of the contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.740" offset="12102301">Therefore, this Court said that Evco then had failed -- the Court of Appeals said, in its burden of showing an unconstitutional tax on interstate commerce and the question on multiple taxations was not before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.352" offset="12192789">Respondent points out that it would be very difficult if not almost impossible for the record to reflect the possibility of another state taxing these transactions -- the possibility of another state taxing these transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.357" offset="12272828">Also with respect to this, the following statement from Freeman v. Hewit seems particularly applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.378" offset="12300936">The immunities implicit in the commerce clause and the potential taxing power of a state can hardly be made to depend in the world of practical affairs on the shipping incidents of the varying tax laws of the various States at a particular moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.741" offset="12402291">I have no further argument.</text>
