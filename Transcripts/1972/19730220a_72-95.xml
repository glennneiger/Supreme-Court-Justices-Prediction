            <text syncTime="41.329" offset="268727">This case involves a black defendant who was indicted in Davidson County, Tennessee in 1948 by a grand jury which did not and had not for some years before, and did not for some years after include a member of Black Race.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.991" offset="415326">Mr. Richardson with the advise and consent of retained counsel, entered a plea of guilty, and accepted a sentence of 99 years in the state penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.532" offset="493484">In 1964, Mr. Henderson first came back into the courts when he attacked or alleged that his confession was coerced, and that his guilty plea was involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.906" offset="587003">The case was ultimately heard by writ of habeas corpus to Federal District Court, the Sixth Circuit, denied him relief and this Court denied cert.</text>

            <text syncTime="141.440" offset="669132">There was reference in the evidentiary hearing in the state court at this case that he was advised at that time that he could raise this question by the -- advised by the attorney that represented him at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.410" offset="729004">The state court granted an evidentiary hearing in this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. R. Jackson Rose</label>
            <text syncTime="165.481" offset="765262">Then we have moved to 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.488" offset="785324">The state granted an evidentiary hearing, and the proof as I have stated earlier showed that there had been no blacks to serve on the grand jury from 1922 until 1953, when the first black was put on the Davidson County grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.341" offset="900786">The selection system from 1947 was that the trial judges, criminal trial judges would pick the people that they wanted on the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.922" offset="979048">There was no random selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.516" offset="1005484">The court denied relief, the state court did, and ultimately the Tennessee appellate court said that he had waived the right by his failure to object by plea of indictment, prior to entering a plea to the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.407" offset="1069014">The rule in Tennessee is substantially the same as the Rule 12 (b) (2) of the Federal Rules for Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.455" offset="1121155">He filed a petition, of course, for habeas corpus in the Federal District Court, and that court granted the relief on the basis of the conclusion of the court that the grand jury was void, it therefore rendered a void indictment, and that he could not have waived it because no attorney in Tennessee would have thought of raising the question in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.162" offset="1263992">Quoting the statement from a concurring opinion in the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals about judge Harvard (ph), the Sixth Circuit held that the indictment was not void, but voidable, but under the unique circumstances of this case in light of back that one of our judges had stated, no lawyer would have thought of raising this in 1948 that Mr. Henderson was entitled to the relief that it was not a knowing intelligent waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.499" offset="1417383">It is our position that Mr. Henderson waived his right to the taxes twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.326" offset="1476629">Once by entering a plea at all, or before raising it and the second time when he entered a plea of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.746" offset="1526366">The first issue of waiving it, by failing to question it prior to waive -- entering a plea to indictment, we follow the same line of reasoning generally, that government did in the proceeding case.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.716" offset="1654262">The court --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="388.895" offset="1658964">Would you just think that he had any kind of waiver in 1964 when he sought habeas corpus release and did not raise the claim?</text>

            <label>Mr. R. Jackson Rose</label>
            <text syncTime="400.099" offset="1703790">Yes, Your Honor, as a matter of fact I filed a motion to dismiss the petition for that reason in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.345" offset="1748720">I did not pursue that issue in there, sorry, in the Court of Appeals, but at least that was my original position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.249" offset="1832417">This Court as has been stated earlier here today, has held that where a defendant is convicted as the result of some illegal evidence, or illegal proceedings that went to the question or the issue of innocence or guilt, that it must be knowing intelligent waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.604" offset="1953834">In this case, if I may state to the Court, this is typically of what -- or shall I say hypothetical situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.624" offset="2009840">Here is a retained counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.388" offset="2020916">He has a client who is facing a possible death penalty, and he has really one thing in mind, the welfare of his client theoretically.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.938" offset="2071176">Assuming that this issue crosses his mind, his client is in jail, his client has made a confession, and taking the feeling of the times in 1948, has a pretty chance of getting the death penalty or at least a reasonable chance of getting the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.250" offset="2176397">And the issue of the composition of the grand jury crosses his mind, he is going to arrive at the conclusion that if I raise that, what will happen?</text>
            <text syncTime="528.036" offset="2215476">I will be successful, and there will be blacks included on the grand jury that will consider the re-indictment of him, but this grand jury has a confession in front of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.361" offset="2284857">It is my position, and I don't think anybody would question the fact that in all likelihood a solid black grand jury would have been indicted him in the face of this confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.935" offset="2343163">Now, this would gain him additional time if he wanted additional time, but there is no speculation really that could come to that conclusion in this case, because he had successfully negotiated a plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.079" offset="2415679">He had agreed apparently successfully, at least he eliminated the possibility of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.795" offset="2458520">The only other reason that it could have -- that an attorney would have considered waiving it, or raising it at that time, would be to further the calls of Civil Rights on this particular issue, to attempt to eliminate this illegal method, but it would have no effect on his client.</text>

            <text syncTime="684.084" offset="2839698">There is the question of knowing intelligent waiver.</text>

            <text syncTime="696.905" offset="2891003">Mr. Henderson's retained counsel, apparently and obviously discussed it, there isn't any question about that he -- and this was raised by Mr. Henderson in an earlier thing that his attorney, or that he reluctantly did it, but that his attorney talked to him in to entering a plea of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.730" offset="2974281">They have talked about this, and they have finally come to the conclusion that to enter a plea of guilty is the best thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.611" offset="3001866">At this point, I think Mr. Henderson do, and I think the record, and the entire record in these proceedings support this, that from that moment on he had no more standing in court, that he was facing a term of 99 years, that he had eliminated the possibility of the death penalty, that the proceedings were over.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.634" offset="3109909">And as a matter of fact they were over for him for some 16 years, before he ever came back to court for anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.120" offset="3155884">The evidence or the circumstantial evidence points to the fact that he knew, and the court has found earlier that it was a voluntary plea of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.165" offset="3200084">That he knew at the time he entered death plea, that this was end of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.373" offset="3220877">I am sure that he did not know constitutional law, that he had numerous rights which many of us spent years studying those particular hearings in law schools, and after we are out too.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.722" offset="3314291">There is no evidence, and I could admit candidly to this court that I am sure that it did not happen, that these were discussed with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.433" offset="3345115">I dare say that there is a prisoner in a penal institutions in Tennessee who knows all of his constitutional rights, and very few lawyers, but here is plea of guilty, was knowing, intelligent, and that he knew the consequences of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.537" offset="3429543">He knew that he has had his day in court, and that that was the end of the line.</text>

            <text syncTime="852.896" offset="3514911">I think we can assume following counsel's argument that there is no real question now that the rights of Mr. Henderson to a grand jury from which members of this race have not been systematically excluded, was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.611" offset="3581785">This was conceded by the State of Tennessee in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.095" offset="3595786">It was conceded in the Court of Appeals in the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.023" offset="3615431">This Court has held recently that this is prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.772" offset="3638418">There were no blacks on the grand jury from 1922 until 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.209" offset="3668198">25% of the population of that county in 1948 was black.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.535" offset="3697560">This is a violation of the respondent's rights under the Equal Protection Clause, as well as the Due Process Clause, and I might point out that any analogy with the federal rules I think would be ruled out, because the Equal Protection Clause is not available to federal prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.533" offset="3777494">It's a prohibition on the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.661" offset="3790033">This Court has also held recently that there is a presumption of prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.445" offset="3825142">He doesn't have to show actual bias or actual harm, but there is a presumption of prejudice when his grand jury -- when the members of his race have been excluded from his grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.200" offset="3872162">I pointed the case of Alexander versus Louisiana, decided last year where a timely motion was filed to object to the grand jury, but no objection was raised as to the petit jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.576" offset="3937677">He went to trail to the petit jury and was convicted, and this Court nevertheless reversed because it felt that the denial of members of his race from the grand jury was sufficiently important that it could not be cured even though he were tried by a constitutionally acceptable jury.</text>
