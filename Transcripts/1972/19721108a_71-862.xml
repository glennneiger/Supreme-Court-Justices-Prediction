            <text syncTime="22.832" offset="194748">This is a Commerce Clause case.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.853" offset="206764">The question presented is whether Illinois in conformance with that clause, may impose its Used Tax on all fuel loaded by United Air Lines, aboard its aircraft about to leave the Chicago airports on interstate and foreign flights.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.452" offset="285132">As found by the trial court and confirmed by the Illinois Supreme Court, the facts can be stated very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.804" offset="318568">All of the fuel is purchased by United from Shell Oil Company at Shell Oil’s terminal in Northern Indiana at which point, delivery occurs and title and risk of loss transfers from Shell to United.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.404" offset="388995">From there, United arranges transportation by common carriers, principally a pipeline to O’Hare and Midway airports in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.194" offset="432149">The fuel is stored at those airports on the average from two to six-and-a-half days of which about two days is required to remove impurities secreted during the transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.444" offset="485125">The fuel is then loaded into United’s aircraft.</text>

            <text syncTime="105.767" offset="526399">There are trucking operations to Midway because the volume is much less there.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.846" offset="542804">Now, the truck as well as pipeline is common carrier and the contracts are between those carriers and United.</text>

            <text syncTime="149.426" offset="701106">They pump a large amounts, the jet fuel is pumped three times a month to O’Hare, the other fuel to Midway is carried by a truck on almost a daily basis.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark H. Berens</label>
            <text syncTime="166.194" offset="768188">A great amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.960" offset="775189">There is variation depending on its destination and depending on how much fuel it came in with.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.877" offset="798908">It can range from, and it's in poundage rather gallons in the air industry from a couple thousand to 60-70,000 lbs of fuel.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.643" offset="841958">This fuel is loaded, almost always immediately just prior to the departure of the aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.806" offset="870588">None other fuel involved in this litigation is used locally or in interstate flights.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.762" offset="898382">Now, these arrangements have been followed by United continuously since 1953 two years prior to the enactment of the Illinois Use Tax Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.636" offset="937880">And they are part of a nationwide contractual arrangement between Shell and United which covers delivery at 43 different points.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.132" offset="971943">For example, United takes delivery at Shell’s Northern Indiana terminal not only for the Chicago airports but for other airports in the Midwestern states.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.809" offset="1014575">All of the fuel loaded is as I said earlier consumed on interstate and foreign flights and almost all of it outside Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.519" offset="1053445">The reason for this is that under the Federal Aviation Regulations, commercial carriers are required to carry large amounts of reserve fuel and the land with this reserve fuel at Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.315" offset="1104645">Now according to the record, 99.9% of the time and it's this fuel that is principally first consumed as the plane leaves the state and keep in mind where Chicago is in Illinois, up at the upper corner of the state so that the distance traversed on many flights, particularly East and North bound over Illinois is 60 or less miles.</text>

            <text syncTime="446.904" offset="1891035">The Illinois Use Tax is a privileged tax imposed on the use of tangible property in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.438" offset="1917158">It is a general Revenue Tax and its proceeds are not allocated to airport construction or maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.715" offset="1946206">The act defines use in the usual broad way to include the exercise of any right of ownership over property.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.694" offset="1978180">But the Illinois act then limits this definition by several exceptions intended according to the explicit terms of the act to prevent and I am quoting, “actual or likely multi state taxation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="481.609" offset="2029798">One of these exceptions is the so-called temporary storage provision, which excludes from the concept of a taxable use, the storage in Illinois or property purchased outside the state brought in by the owner and then used outside the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.067" offset="2099597">The construction placed on this provision by the Illinois Supreme Court in the decision below raises the serious Commerce Clause issue that is appealed to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.346" offset="2148707">From 1955 when the act was first enacted until 1963, Illinois sought only to tax that portion of the Chicago laden fuel that was actually burned over Illinois by the departing flights.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.640" offset="2201893">This was known as the “burn off” rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.163" offset="2212028">And United did not contest the constitutionality of the tax during that period because it considered it not unfair.</text>

            <text syncTime="568.199" offset="2376182">The bulletin contrasted this with the situation where the fuel is hauled, as it called it by a separate facilities, by which it meant a tank truck or a railroad tanker or a pipeline, in which case, the storage, the withdrawal nor the transportation was taxable.</text>

            <text syncTime="670.466" offset="2785259">First of all, as a preliminary conclusion, it held that the “burn off’ rule was unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause citing Helson and Randolph v. Kentucky volume 279 of this Court’s reports and this place, the per curiam judges in the anonymous position that holding a tax on that part of the fuel loaded at Chicago, that was actually consumed in Illinois was a burden on the Commerce, but that if the state taxed all of the fuel loaded, even though it was burned outside the state, it was not a burn-off thereby, making a tax on part more of a burden than tax on all.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.675" offset="2982118">But returning to the construction of the temporary storage provision, the court discussed three events that applied to all the fuel, the storage, the withdrawal and the loading it aboard the aircraft and it spelled out a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.864" offset="3058813">It said that if the fuel were removed from the storage and taken by again, separate facilities, or as it is expressed it, in a vehicle which does not consume the fuel, to another state, neither the storage nor the withdrawal nor the loading onto that vehicle, nor the transportation from the state would be subject to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.352" offset="3152750">It contrasted this with the situation where the fuel is stored the same way, withdrawn in the same way, but loaded on a vehicle which consumes it.</text>

            <text syncTime="792.422" offset="3273017">Now it attempted to relate the taxable use back to the storage, but we submit that's a non sequitur because the storage in both instances is the same, so is the withdrawal.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.267" offset="3316485">What is decisive and is the taxable event, we submit, is the loading onto the vehicle which consumes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.263" offset="3344384">And thus the per curiam, the concurring opinions and the bulletin of the Illinois Department of Revenue, all arrived in different language at the same point that the taxable event is the loading of the fuel onto the aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.885" offset="3406869">Now this, we believe takes us squarely into the authority of Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert, volume 357 and a number of other cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="940.219" offset="3864221">In Michigan-Wisconsin, the Court cited, Joseph v. Carter &amp; Weekes which some years earlier had invalidated a New York City gross receipts tax on the income of a Stevedoring Company loading ships in New York Harbor and unloading.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.013" offset="3931408">And that case stated, the Carter &amp; Weekes and I quote from page 427, “Transportation in Commerce at the least begins with loading and ends with unloading.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.345" offset="4000789">Loading and unloading has effect on transportation outside the taxing state because those activities are not only preliminary to, but are essential part of the transportation itself.”</text>
            <text syncTime="986.855" offset="4050840">To the same effect are numerous cases cited in our brief and we have found no authority in the regulatory area or the tax area there holds that loading is not an integral part of interstate transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.459" offset="4121161">At least in its brief the state bases and justifies this tax primarily on Nashville v. Wallace, 288 U.S. and Edelman v. Boeing Air Transport.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.685" offset="4170062">In both of those cases, I should add, which respectively involved the taxation by Tennessee and Wyoming of fuel that was eventually used in an interstate rail system and an interstate air carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.728" offset="4226278">In both of those cases, this Court accepted the construction of the lower courts that the state tax involved was on the storage or at the withdrawal from the storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.361" offset="4280822">And based on that, this Court concluded that the taxable event was prior to the commencement of the interstate movement, prior to the loading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.057" offset="4323558">And I emphasize that in both of those states at the time of the litigation, there was nothing resembling a temporary storage provision as exists in Illinois, making the statutory situation fundamentally different in our opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1156.350" offset="4728769">That because of the export provision, there couldn't be any tax, but also I may add in the Edelman, that seems to have been a mistake in applying the statute rather than a constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.607" offset="4809749">The state also relies on Southern Pacific Co. v. Gallagher which together with the other two cases I just mentioned, is specifically distinguished by Carter &amp; Weekes at 330 U.S. 432 (Inaudible).</text>

            <text syncTime="1237.789" offset="5054568">In addition, as pointed out in our reply brief, there is a potentiality of states down stream taxing the same fuel in situations where a flight lands, let us say in Dayton, Ohio and then proceeds to Columbus where there is a segment within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.339" offset="5116740">This applies to roughly one out of five of United’s departures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.279" offset="5148505">We don't want to rely entirely on authority, but we like to relate to the fundamental purpose of the Commerce Clause and I think this was well stated in the Carter &amp; Weekes case at the very end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.990" offset="5211303">Not only do these precedents outlaw taxes, but it has reason to support such outlawing in the likelihood that legislation will flourish more luxuriantly, where most revenue will come from foreign and interstate commerce, thus in Port cities and transportation or handling centers, without discrimination against out of state as compared with local business, larger proportions of necessary revenue could be obtained from the flow of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.148" offset="5339930">The avoidance of such a toll on the passage of Commerce through a locality was one of the reasons for the adoption of the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.354" offset="5368769">Now, we view this as a toll, not in a classical sense, but if you look at the Use Tax as the privilege of enjoined property, the enjoinment of consumable goods such as fuel is in its consumption, not on its storage, but only a very small fraction of this fuel is actually consumed in Illinois and that only in about less than 4% of the departing flights of United.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.031" offset="5467512">The rest is burned outside Illinois and much of it in other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.444" offset="5481200">If you strip this, it's formalism, Illinois then seeks to impose a toll on fuel purchased outside of the state temporarily stored here only in the words of the Illinois Supreme Court to facilitate United's interstate operations from Chicago.</text>

            <text syncTime="1840.341" offset="7464730">The question presented before this court is whether United Airlines exercise such a right or power over tangible property, in this case, it is aviation fuel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.067" offset="7511646">Incident of the ownership of that property in Illinois, so as to subject United to the provisions of the Illinois Use Tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.508" offset="7545396">Whether or not the imposition of this tax is violative of the Commerce Clause set forth in Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution, and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.857" offset="7594820">The Illinois Use Tax which went into effect in August of 1955, imposes a tax on the privilege of using in the state of Illinois tangible personal property that was purchased elsewhere and was designed to compliment the retailer's occupational tax under which a tax is imposed upon person’s engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property to purchasers for use and consumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.179" offset="7704116">Now both of these statues, the Illinois Use Tax and the Illinois Retailer's Occupation Tax have both been found to be constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.854" offset="7738807">The Use Tax Act of Illinois was enacted for the valid purposes of preventing evasion of the Retailer's Occupational Tax by persons making out of state purchases of tangible personal property for use in the Illinois, and also the additional purpose of protecting Illinois merchants against diversion of businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.367" offset="7828877">Shell Oil Company in this case refines its Turbine fuel and its refineries in Wood River, Illinois, then transfers it via pipelines 250 miles to storage facilities in Hammond and East Chicago, Indiana for storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.061" offset="7895646">Both Hammond and East Chicago, Indiana are South suburbs of the City of Chicago and no further processing occurs at Shell’s facilities, merely the filtering necessitated by the pipeline transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.182" offset="7952071">United Air Lines purchase this aviation from Fuel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.421" offset="7969102">United sends its orders into Shell's office in East Chicago, Indiana, takes delivery in Indiana, and transfers the aviation fuel via a common carrier pipeline, to the storage tanks in Des Plaines, Illinois which is a Northwest suburb of the City of Chicago just adjacent to O’Hare airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.850" offset="8054784">The storage tanks in Des Plaines are owned by Shell Oil Company, but are leased to United and to American, where gas owned by both companies is commingled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.337" offset="8096684">The aviation fuel is allowed to settle in storage tanks in Des Plaines, Illinois before it is transferred again by pipeline owned by Shell but leased to United, United’s O’Hare airport underground facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.979" offset="8155303">These underground tank service the jet aircraft, before they embark from O’Hare.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.624" offset="8177873">The delivery of the gasoline to Chicago’s Midway airport is via common carrier tanks, trucks from Shell’s Indiana facilities to the Midway airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.995" offset="8223326">Now, all aviation fuel that is ultimately pumped into United's aircraft at either O’Hare or at Midway and that is subject to the present litigation is either refined and/or stored by Shell at Wood River, Illinois facilities prior to its transfer to Hammond and East Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.943" offset="8303156">Now Shell claims that it pays an income tax based on one half of one percent of its gross sales in Indiana, but Shell pays no sales tax or retail occupation tax to the state of Indiana, or to the state of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.654" offset="8365955">United does not pay any sales tax or use tax in any state other than the Illinois on the purchase of the fuel involved in this controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.422" offset="8405034">From August, 1955 until June 3rd, 1963, United paid to the state of Illinois without protest a use tax on this fuel purchase, delivery and storage on that portion of the fuel deemed to have been used or consumed within the borders of Illinois on flights departing from Midway and O’Hare to points outside of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.299" offset="8500537">The advantage of this “Burn off” theory is that in many instances it would make United subject only to a use tax on the 10-15 mile trip from O’Hare to Lake Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.449" offset="8549125">Then as now, Illinois's use tax was imposed upon the privilege of using in Illinois, tangible personal property which is purchased at retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.900" offset="8594996">Now use as is defined in the Illinois statute, is defined “exercise by any person of any right or power over tangible personal property incident to the ownership of that property.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.004" offset="8659362">Now, Section 3 of the Illinois Use Tax from its inception in 1955 has provided for exemptions from the payment of that tax and we recite these in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.504" offset="8705337">There are quite a number, but I would like to call the court’s attention just to two provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.502" offset="8725400">Section 3 (c) states the Illinois Use Tax has provided the exemption from the tax “To prevent actual or likely multi-state taxation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.045" offset="8783600">The tax here imposed shall not apply for the use of tangible personal property in this state under the following circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.103" offset="8815783">Circumstances (C) is the use in the state of tangible personal property which is acquired outside of the state and cause to be brought into the state by a person who has already paid a tax in another state in respect to the sale, purchase or use of such property to the extent of the amount of such tax so paid in the other state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.335" offset="8908675">Now the exemption D which counsel alluded to the temporary storage one.</text>

            <text syncTime="2495.465" offset="10085230">In this case, Tennessee levied a privilege tax upon the storage of gasoline within the state and its withdrawal from storage for use or sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.720" offset="10122219">The tax payer was an interstate rail carrier purchasing large quantities of gasoline outside of Tennessee, and transporting it into the state in tank cars from which it unloaded it and placed this gasoline in storage tanks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.311" offset="10176658">All of the fuel that was withdrawn and used by it as a source of motor power in interstate railway operations was taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.000" offset="10211349">The taxpayer challenged the imposition of the tax on the basis that was imposed on the gasoline which was still a subject of interstate commerce and also on the basis that in effect that the tax was upon the use of gasoline in appellant’s interstate business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.098" offset="10275715">In this particular case, the Court held that the power to tax property, the sum of all the rights and powers, incident ownership means that the state can tax the successive exercise of two of the powers incident to ownership, storage and withdrawal of the storage, both completed before interstate commerce began.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.773" offset="10358471">Now in the case of Edelman versus Boeing Air Transport which was discussed, Wyoming imposed a license tax upon the use of gasoline within the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="2588.789" offset="10458572">The taxpayer contended that the state could not validly apply the use tax to gasoline imported from outside the state, stored in tanks at the airport and use for filling the interstate planes in which it was eventually consumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.731" offset="10518340">The tax was applied to stored gasoline as it was withdrawn from storage tanks at the airport and placed in planes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.277" offset="10548433">In this particular case, the Edelman case, the Court upheld the tax upon the theory that a state may validly tax the use to which gasoline is put and then withdrawing it from storage within the state and placing it in tanks or planes notwithstanding that the ultimate function was to generate motive power for carrying on interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="2713.356" offset="10956779">Now any right or power includes United’s loading, the fuel aboard its planes and the storing and withdrawal from the storage of the fuel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.498" offset="10993351">When the fuel is loaded on the aircraft, it is irrevocably committed to its ultimate use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.103" offset="11019786">Now, both in the Nashville case and the Edelman case, the courts have held that storage and withdrawal from storage of gasoline was complete before interstate commerce began.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.026" offset="11063463">It was further held that the burden of tax was too indirect and remote from the function of the interstate commerce to transgress constitutional limitations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.233" offset="11104319">Now both the per curiam and the dissenting opinions of the Illinois Supreme Court agree that the events of storing fuel in Illinois or the taking of fuel from storage in Illinois are constitutionally taxable under the Illinois Use Tax because these events are complete before interstate commerce begins.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.263" offset="11184462">Indeed, the United this morning or this afternoon conceded that if temporary storage provisions of the Illinois Use Tax did not apply to the incidents in question, then it is subject to the Illinois Use Tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.676" offset="11238066">United however, asserts that all fuel placed in tanks of its planes continues to be exempt under the Temporary Storage Provision of the Illinois Use Tax Act, and that the exemption is lost and the fuel is subject to the tax only to the extent of the fuel released from the tanks consumption over Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.788" offset="11318523">Now the statute in question refers to “Temporary storage in this state” of tangible personal property and to such property “Stored here temporarily.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.888" offset="11382888">The meaning of the term stored or storage has been defined as a deposit in a store or a warehouse for safekeeping.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.091" offset="11419773">Here, the fuel is not placed in the tanks of the airplane for safekeeping, but for consumption and it cannot be said, the fuel will be solely used outside of the State of the Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.970" offset="11471287">To accept the United’s argument that the placing of fuel in departing planes is going to continuation of temporary storage and that the burning of fuel in and over Illinois is the termination of the temporary storage and the fuels released as the plane operates is a local event or used this properly taxable would completely run us afoul of Helson versus Kentucky, and if United's theory is correct, then each state could pay the “Burn off’ as the plane or charged the 'Burn off” rather as the plane crossed over state borders and this would then be chargeable burden to interstate state commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="2923.306" offset="11796564">Kentucky attempted to tax the consumption of that gas and the Court found that the gasoline in this instance was an instrumentality of interstate commerce and the tax was actually a price on the privilege of using interstate commerce and therefore according to the Helson, the “Burn off” theory as you cross the border could not be carried forth.</text>
