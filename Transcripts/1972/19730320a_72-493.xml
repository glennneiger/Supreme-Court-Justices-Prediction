            <text syncTime="10.226" offset="144280">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.099" offset="147728">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.033" offset="159535">The named appellant in this case is John Vlandis who was the Director of Admissions at the University of Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.412" offset="185031">The appellees were both students at the time of the bringing of this action and what they seek to question is the constitutionality of a Connecticut General Statute, setting an out of state differential in tuition for students.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.343" offset="252740">And they particularly single in on a line of a statute, which states that once the out of state status has been determined, the students shall maintain the status for the balance of his or her attendance at the institute of higher education.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.595" offset="321703">I would point out that although the word permanent is used throughout the briefs and in the record below, the statute is not permanent in the complete sense, in that a student originally out of state, may still come into Connecticut before applying for admission, and at that time, gain in-state status.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.761" offset="402369">So I think what we've really got here is something more than permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.081" offset="415744">I think what is really being argued is a durational test for tuition differentials.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.116" offset="439881">Now this is the point that is specifically brought up on the amicus briefs and were filed by the University of Washington and also by the Civil Liberties Union of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.503" offset="477393">I think that is the real question that is here before the Court, mainly what durational test can a state place in making this discrimination as to in-state or out-state.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.565" offset="529638">It's a question of considerable importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.323" offset="540714">One analyst estimates that some $300-400 million maybe as stake for state supported institutions of higher education.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.023" offset="575509">I think my particular problem that I have to persuade the Court as to is whether or not the Court's decision in Dunn v. Blumstein should be expanded to cover an out of states tuition situation rather than voting rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.807" offset="650637">And it's this I'm going to address myself too because I think this is the particular question that I have to make.</text>

            <text syncTime="201.028" offset="907473">Your Honor, I justify that on this basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.144" offset="919907">Dunn v. Blumstein set up a formula that applied to voting rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.520" offset="941432">It was almost a mechanistic formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.372" offset="948851">It said any durational residence requirement triggered this consuming state interest standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.886" offset="982915">A standard which I have to agree with the Chief Justice's words in that case, is almost an insurmountable obstacle for the state to meet, but I think it's fair for the state -- for this Court to limit the judgment in Dunn v. Blumstein to a voting situation or as it did in Shapiro to a welfare situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.123" offset="1059819">I think we're talking about something different when we're talking about a tuition differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.281" offset="1084479">We're not trying to say in this case that the person cannot establish residency for voting purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.360" offset="1108825">We're not saying he can't establish it for purposes of receiving welfare as Shapiro was based.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.675" offset="1138082">What we are saying is that the Court ought to look to the nature of the right that is affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.102" offset="1163786">In this case, it's the right to receive a subsidized education on the part of the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="678.018" offset="2815457">This statute does not affect any other rights of citizenship, it doesn't affect boarding, it doesn't affect the welfare.</text>

            <text syncTime="785.507" offset="3245432">And I would urge the Court to consider it in that context because that's really the context we are talking about.</text>
