            <text syncTime="13.980" offset="159326">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.929" offset="175104">This case comes here on a writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the United States Court of Appeals from the Ninth Circuit, reversing an order of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, denying Mr. Bustamonte’s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.993" offset="259323">The questions presented are one, whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding invalid a search based upon a verbal expression of consent in an atmosphere free of coercion, on the sole ground that the State had failed to demonstrate that consent was given with knowledge that it could be withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.297" offset="340511">The second point is somewhat broader.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.093" offset="351796">It is, whether questions relating to search and seizure should remain available to state prisoners seeking to set aside a final conviction on federal habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.421" offset="397040">A jury found Robert Clyde Bustamonte guilty of possessing a completed check in violation --- completed check with intent to defraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.574" offset="445628">At the trial three stolen and forged checks were admitted into evidence over defense objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.468" offset="477288">The facts of the case are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.750" offset="486379">On January 19, 1967, the Speedway Car Wash in Mountain View, California, a town about 30 miles south of San Francisco, was burglarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.899" offset="530996">A number of blank checks and a check protector were taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.948" offset="547192">Subsequently, these checks were completed by respondent Bustamonte, using the check protector and forging the Car Wash owner’s name.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.409" offset="588988">Bustamonte, together with Joe Alcala and Joe Gonzales, then set out to cash the checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.304" offset="624619">On the evening of January 30, the three proceeded to San Jose, to find persons who might be willing to use false identification to cash the checks and then sharing the proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.128" offset="671848">They picked up three men, but their efforts to cash the checks were unsuccessful.</text>

            <text syncTime="156.812" offset="730572">This evidence came out at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.713" offset="750216">It appears in the opinion of the California Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.929" offset="767039">At 2:45, the following morning, as the six men were driving along the highway, a police officer on patrol noticed that their car had only one functioning headlight.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.656" offset="813955">He made a U-turn to follow the car, and then saw that it had no rear license plate light either.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.941" offset="839137">He then stopped the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.635" offset="845928">Gonzales was driving and Alcala and Bustamonte were in the front seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.977" offset="863274">Three other men were in the rear.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.112" offset="875813">Gonzales had no driver’s license, nor any identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.073" offset="891695">Neither did anybody else, except Mr. Alcala, who produced his driver’s license and stated that the car belonged to his brother.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.746" offset="922311">The officer who was alone, asked the men to step out of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.429" offset="941119">Meanwhile, he had called for a backup patrol.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.052" offset="955538">After the officer was joined by two other police officers, he asked Alcala if he could search the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.871" offset="982810">Alcala replied, “Sure, go right ahead.”</text>
            <text syncTime="224.082" offset="999737">Gonzales, who testified at the trial, corroborated the statement and testified that Alcala even assisted in the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.245" offset="1032338">In the search the officers found three protectorized checks, wadded up under the rear seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.425" offset="1057102">These checks were payable to different named individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.710" offset="1070164">Later on a search warrant was obtained to search Bustamonte’s own two automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.061" offset="1091584">There the searching officers found other blank Speedway checks, the check protector, and a number of traffic citations relating to Bustamonte.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.380" offset="1128887">The writing on the checks was that of Bustamonte.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.488" offset="1145292">At the trial, and on appeal in the California Court of Appeals, our intermediate appellate court, Bustamonte contended that Alcala’s consent for search was invalid because Alcala had not been warned of his right to refuse consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.850" offset="1210807">The California Court of Appeal rejected this contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.241" offset="1228361">It applied the established State standard for judging consent searches, first articulated by our former State Chief Justice, Roger Traynor, the author of California’s exclusionary rule, declared six years prior to Mapp v. Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.515" offset="1289383">And this is the California consent rule, as stated by Justice Traynor, “Whether in a particular case an apparent consent was in fact voluntarily given or was in submission to an express or implied assertion of authority, is a question of fact to be determined in the light of all the circumstances.”</text>
            <text syncTime="316.833" offset="1370676">Here the California Court of Appeal concluded that the consent was voluntarily given, because it was verbally stated by Alcala, in response to a request for permission to search.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.430" offset="1417070">There is no overt coercion, nor was there any implied assertion of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.954" offset="1439222">Indeed, the Court of Appeal noted that the atmosphere at the time of the car stop was congenial.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.053" offset="1463568">The California Supreme Court then denied Mr. Bustamonte’s petition for a discretionary hearing of the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.375" offset="1504841">In May 1969, Bustamonte filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.635" offset="1549876">The petition was denied on February 10, 1970, without the issuance of an order to show cause, but the Minutes of the District Court recite that the federal judge had before him the opinion of the California Court of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.284" offset="1616541">The District Court also granted a certificate of probable cause, and leave to appeal to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.419" offset="1653008">In September 1971, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the order of the District Court and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.154" offset="1691982">That Court held that California had failed to show that the consent was valid because there was no specific showing that Alcala knew that he could refuse permission to search.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.982" offset="1743287">There we come to the crux of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.485" offset="1753318">California’s consent rule, analogous to the rule articulated by this Court prior to Miranda for assessing a voluntariness of confessions, makes knowledge of one's rights, one of the circumstances to be considered in determining voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.365" offset="1824789">It is a relative fact, but it is not the determinative fact, it is only one of the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.522" offset="1849448">The Ninth Circuit opinion makes it determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.583" offset="1861674">It has substituted its waiver standard for California’s voluntariness test.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.686" offset="1886124">In effect, it held that Justice Traynor’s rule for assessing voluntariness was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.605" offset="1921755">So the question before the Court today is not the relative merits of the Ninth Circuit waiver of rule, or the California voluntariness rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.612" offset="1961775">The question is, could the Ninth Circuit impose its Federal rule on the State, when the State had an equally valid rule?</text>
            <text syncTime="476.937" offset="2011094">Now, the Fourth Amendment is not absolute in its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.234" offset="2028335">This Court has said many times that it does not prohibit all searches, only unreasonable searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.095" offset="2055711">The conceptual basis of the California consent rule is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.220" offset="2072221">It is not unreasonable for an officer to act on permission to search granted in response to a request therefore, under circumstances free from overt coercion or any implied assertion of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.065" offset="2127600">No more than this is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.279" offset="2136482">Since we’re judging reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment, it’s not absolute, it’s relative and reasonableness of government action cannot, and it should not be judged solely by the affected party’s subjective state of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.667" offset="2210043">That a subjective waiver standard is inappropriate in Fourth Amendment cases, becomes clear when we examine three distinct lines of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.198" offset="2252152">The first of these is third-party consent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.543" offset="2265527">As recently as Coolidge v. New Hampshire, and Frazier v. Cupp, this Court, with little if any division on the point, held that the third party could consent to a search of a subject’s property where the consent was given under circumstances showing it was voluntarily given.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.285" offset="2364479">This seems to me to militate against a waiver standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.371" offset="2384854">If we were talking about Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, surely this Court would not countenance a third party’s waiver of a defendant’s Miranda rights, his right to counsel, or his right to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.547" offset="2449533">Indeed, the decision in Boykin v. Alabama indicates that these rights must be waived personally by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.256" offset="2480358">The second line of authority consists of those cases including Hill v. California, which have held that the reasonableness of an officer’s actions in making an arrest are to be judged on the basis of how they appeared to him and a reasonable mistake of fact will not invalidate an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.390" offset="2568965">Significantly, in Stoner v. California, referred to in the earlier argument this morning, the Court rejected the purported action based in the consent of a hotel clerk, because the Court specifically said, the police could not reasonably believe that the hotel clerk had authority to consent to the search of the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.935" offset="2671156">I think, conversely, this indicates that if the police had reasonably believed that the man had authority to consent, the Court would have sustained their actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.363" offset="2716818">And the third line of cases supporting our position is that overwhelming trend of authority which rejects the requirement of a specific warning in search and seizure cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.615" offset="2777840">We have cited them in the brief, they are quite numerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.582" offset="2797693">Now, not only -- these cases are significant, because wherever this Court has imposed a waiver standard, the necessity of a warning has followed shortly thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.113" offset="2863835">And there are good reasons for not requiring warnings in consent to search cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.711" offset="2882226">For one thing, it certainly is not calculated to improve police-community relationships, because in some cases police do ask permission to search, and if they are refused, they are entitled to search on separate grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.404" offset="2945024">For example, exigency, or probable cause to search a moving vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.591" offset="2973759">Also, unlike a confession case, where the giving of a confession shortly after a waiver of Miranda rights is itself evidence that the rights were understood and waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.832" offset="3026735">The mere existence of tangible products obtained in a search are no proof that a warning was given and a waiver obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.138" offset="3063933">Third, the Miranda rule was intended to forestall conditions which would give rise to coerced confessions, the most unreliable kind of self-incriminating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.966" offset="3115238">The exclusionary rule, on the other hand, does not go to the reliability of the fact-finding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.444" offset="3141151">Finally, although this was discounted by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, it does make good sense to say, as did the California Court of Appeal in this case, that when permission is sought from a person of ordinary intelligence, the very fact that consent is given carries the implication that an alternative of refusal existed.</text>

            <text syncTime="782.631" offset="3233938">Mr. Granucci, you said that the existence of a confession is itself evidence that the Miranda rights were understood and waived, whereas the production of tangible goods is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.130" offset="3283884">I don’t think I quite understand your distinctions, at least stated that shortly?</text>

            <text syncTime="800.083" offset="3303737">I think, perhaps I have to expand them a bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.177" offset="3320038">Where an officer testifies that he warned the suspect and gave him the Miranda rights, and shortly thereafter a confession is given by the man, by the suspect, I think the very fact of the confession being given is some evidence of a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.545" offset="3421602">Now, in Miranda, the Court said you can’t produce – you can't presume waiver merely from a silent, from merely a silent record, where a confession is given without a warning, but when it follows the warning I think it’s reasonable to conclude that the confession is itself some evidence of waiver, it may not be conclusive, but it’s some evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.816" offset="3510627">Whereas, when you have a tangible piece of property, that property is not going to tell you whether or not consent to search was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.515" offset="3549393">But the confession, the fact of the confession is itself some evidence of waiver.</text>

            <text syncTime="867.363" offset="3572799">As I have understood your brief, your argument in part was that the very fact of a request by the officer gave -- amounted to an inference, an indication that the request could be denied?</text>

            <text syncTime="889.275" offset="3660466">And the Ninth Circuit discounted that by saying that verbal assent is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.895" offset="3682931">In our view, the implication apparently relied on by the California Courts can hardly suffice as a general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.055" offset="3715636">Under many circumstances, a reasonable person might read an officer’s “may I” as the courteous expression of a demand backed by the force of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1657.635" offset="6733928">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.289" offset="6748557">The two issues presented in this case are, first, can a consent search be valid in the absence of a showing of any knowledge of the Fourth Amendment right being relinquished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.946" offset="6791189">The second issue is, can State prisoners continue to use Federal habeas corpus to raise their Fourth Amendment claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.037" offset="6823476">With respect to the consent search issue, it seems to me that there are two questions to be answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.547" offset="6849599">The first question is, what are the elements of a waiver of fundamental constitutional rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.889" offset="6874885">As recently as last June, in Baker versus Wingo, this Court defined a waiver of constitutional rights as an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege and courts are to indulge every reasonable presumption against the existence of such a surrender.</text>

            <text syncTime="1718.081" offset="6975718">Mr. Chief Justice, I don’t believe so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.800" offset="6982614">I think that the essential elements are, first, the voluntariness, the fact that it is in fact an intentional act and second, that the right be known.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.981" offset="7019290">I would submit that I don’t frankly understand how a man can be deemed to have surrendered a right unless he knows it exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.822" offset="7046666">I mean, what has he done?</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.572" offset="7053667">It seems to me that to surrender the right means that he was aware of its existence, and decided, for any of a number of reasons, to give it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.912" offset="7087000">I believe that the central question is really one that you have alluded to, sir, namely, should a consent search be deemed the equivalent of a waiver of Fourth Amendment rights, so that all waiver elements, including knowledge, must be demonstrated to validate the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.581" offset="7149693">Contrary to the State’s position, good faith on the part of the police is not an acceptable criteria for determining whether a search is valid under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.163" offset="7192012">Rather, the criteria under the Fourth Amendment is one of reasonableness, and this concept of reasonableness is embedded in history and context of the evils the Fourth Amendment was intended to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.575" offset="7241644">The primary aim of the Fourth Amendment is to protect each individual’s privacy from arbitrary governmental intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.906" offset="7271006">It is a focus on the right of the victim, not on the good faith, subjective state of mind, if I may say, of the police officer conducting the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.587" offset="7305697">This Court has repeatedly reiterated that the Fourth Amendment is among the most fundamental of our constitutional safeguards, and, over the years, many cases have come before this Court, which have resulted in the establishment of safeguards and very, very elaborate procedures to validate a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.696" offset="7374137">I would call the Court’s attention to its recent statement in Coolidge versus New Hampshire, that warrantless searches are deemed per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, subject to a few very limited, well defined exceptions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2150.719" offset="8706278">However, I think that one of the problems is that there are many cases that appear to turn on minor technicalities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2178.506" offset="8817351">This case, I really believe, goes to the fundamental question of, who is entitled to Fourth Amendment protections?</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.902" offset="8842951">Is it only the man who is sophisticated and educated and knows of his rights, and who will not consent; or is it all of the citizens, including the poor person, the uneducated person, the person who fears the police?</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.442" offset="8889135">If they are all to be entitled to the Fourth Amendment’s protections, I don’t see how they can be deemed to have given up that right, unless there is some showing in the record that they were aware of it at the time they allegedly surrendered it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2723.741" offset="10998366">I would like to emphasize, once again, what I think to be the most important aspect to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.137" offset="11015920">That is that I’m not seeking to impose what I feel to be an undue burden on law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.400" offset="11040998">After all, consent searches do not involve probable cause, they do not involve emergencies, they do not involve dangers to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.199" offset="11072136">The sole justification for the search is the suspect’s invitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.622" offset="11089899">Therefore, I submit that the Court should make the effort to determine whether a knowledgeable surrender of constitutional rights was present at the time such consent is given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.640" offset="11129919">Furthermore, it is my understanding that federal agencies, such as the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, and the F.B.I., do obtain written consents before conducting a search, and I have seen one of the forms that is used by the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, and it does contain a statement to apprise the suspect of his rights under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.114" offset="11215809">Again, I don’t believe that this is an undue burden on the one hand for the police; on the other hand, I think that to reject the waiver test would be to, in effect, substantially dilute the effectiveness of the Fourth Amendment, and actually remove it, actually from the protections of many citizens of this country, who simply are not aware of their constitutional rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2826.780" offset="11410474">If the police have a probable cause to seek a warrant, I think that this Court’s decisions indicate that they should take that tack.</text>

            <text syncTime="2837.719" offset="11454255">At a time when they’re seeking consent, if it is, in fact, a search that can only be justified by consent, there is no other basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="2898.889" offset="11698970">I do recognize the fact that there are ambiguities and difficulties that the police officer must face up to, but I believe that unless the waiver test is applied with respect to the Fourth Amendment, the result would be that, as a matter of law, the police can conduct searches against vast segments of the society that, as a matter of law, they cannot otherwise conduct and that they could not conduct, for example, against people who are aware of their Fourth Amendment rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="3160.973" offset="12747316">If I may, I’d like to turn to the second issue, which is, should State prisoners continue to have access to Federal habeas corpus to raise Fourth Amendment claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.551" offset="12789530">The State requests the Court to turn its back on the extensive, historical development of habeas corpus as a remedy to vindicate fundamental constitutional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.496" offset="12829341">In 1969, in Kaufman versus United States, this Court held that Federal prisoners can use Federal habeas corpus to raise Fourth Amendment claims, even though such claims have been previously considered in a Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.604" offset="12881795">State prisoners have an even greater need for Federal habeas corpus, since it will probably be their first opportunity to raise their Federal constitutional claim in a Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.171" offset="12928084">Since 1916, certiorari has been the only direct appellate access into Federal courts which is available to State prisoners under normal -- under  most criminal convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.737" offset="12970297">Again, in 1963, in Fay versus Noia, this Court indicated that since certiorari is by no means the equivalent of a normal, direct appellate channel, there is no need to file a petition for a writ of certiorari as a precondition to seeking Federal habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.849" offset="13030797">Today, with the increased workload of this Court, certiorari is even less of an effective direct appellate channel than it was when Fay versus Noia was decided back in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.346" offset="13076773">Thus it seems to me to be quite clear that the State’s real goal is to deprive State prisoners of any meaningful access to Federal courts in connection with their Fourth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.864" offset="13122853">The Court indicated its firm refusal to do this in Kaufman, and I respectfully urge the Court to continue to reject the State’s position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.677" offset="13158066">Federal habeas corpus is the main opportunity for careful, consistent Federal court review of State court decisions regarding the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.940" offset="13195160">The fifty State Supreme Courts can develop, and have developed in the past, inconsistent or erroneous rules regarding fundamental constitutional protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.713" offset="13234239">Federal habeas corpus provides an efficient, effective remedy to correct those errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.984" offset="13255346">It guarantees the fair and equal treatment for all citizens, wherever tried, with respect to their fundamental constitutional protections, including those of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.847" offset="13302784">Clearly, then, Federal habeas corpus is the principle remedy available to implement the rule of Ker versus California, as I previously stated my understanding of that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.021" offset="13347506">Moreover, and although I will admit that this possibly goes beyond the narrow scope of this issue, I believe that Federal habeas corpus decisions have the same general deterrent effect on progressive law enforcement departments as decisions at pretrial, at trial, or on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.934" offset="13423156">It seems to me it’s one thing for a police officer who conducted a particular search, or the particular seizure, to see that he lost the case as a result of his conduct; possibly that will affect his conduct, possibly it will not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.133" offset="13471953">I think the more important aspect of this is the general deterrent value of all court decisions dealing with the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3620.848" offset="14586755">I would commence by noting that Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s last question is not a hypothetical one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.288" offset="14612564">It describes a real and very disturbing situation is the Ninth Circuit, where that court, in some of the cases cited in out brief, has applied its own waiver standard in cases brought by State prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.143" offset="14671914">Whereas the highest court of the State of California has declared that consent to search is to be judged by a voluntariness standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.883" offset="14706918">Now, let me step back and clarify one thing, if I haven’t done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.097" offset="14731786">We do not say that simple consent to search is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.285" offset="14752475">California courts are concerned about the possibility of an implied assertion of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.321" offset="14780688">They are very concerned about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.713" offset="14790196">The question is, how do we judge?</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.661" offset="14805974">How do we -- what means do we invoke to judge the question of implied assertion of authority?</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.353" offset="14840769">California uses objective circumstances, and it’s a constitutional rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.624" offset="14869817">Now, counsel observed that Alcala wouldn’t have consented to this search if he thought he could refuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.192" offset="14912136">Well, I would suggest to the Court that there are some good reasons why Alcala might want to consent, even if he knew the checks were in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.185" offset="14944110">He could very well feel, “Well, they have stopped us and they’ve got us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.268" offset="14964485">And if they find the checks, they won’t find them on me, and I can always say later on, I didn’t know they were in the car.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.751" offset="14990399">And the consent, “the fact that I consented would be some indication that I didn’t know.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3813.487" offset="15357367">The officer, on his instinct, thought, “Well, here we are, it’s 2:45 in the morning, we have three young men in the front seat, three older men in the back seat, nobody has got any identification except Alcala, and they’ve all given inconsistent stories about who picked who up, and where they were going."</text>
