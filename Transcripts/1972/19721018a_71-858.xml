            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We’ll hear arguments now in number 71-858 Ricci against the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.519" offset="133413">Mr. Torshen.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jerome H. Torshen</label>
            <text syncTime="8.735" offset="138324">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.240" offset="152325">This case involves the issue of primary jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.701" offset="174164">Specifically, the issue is whether a complaint alleging a group boycott to exclude a competitor from the marketplace per se violation of the Sherman Act brought against the commodity exchange, certain of its officer, a member and another individual must first be referred to the Commodities Exchange Commission or to the Secretary of Agriculture for decision before it may be referred to the District Court, the antitrust court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.403" offset="301014">Very briefly and capsulated, the facts are that petitioner purchased the membership on the Exchange, another member claimed to be the owner of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.054" offset="343542">It is alleged that the claimant induced the officers of the Exchange to transfer the membership to a third party and as a result petitioner was deprived of his trading privileges and excluded from the marketplace willfully, knowingly, and maliciously as a result of the conspiracy between these parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.697" offset="430164">The history of the case too, must be stated so that we can get to the issues and clear away some of the underbrush that appears in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.370" offset="468825">In the District Court, this case arose on the pleadings and was resolved on motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, specifically lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter for the reason that the antitrust laws did not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.978" offset="539251">In the Court of Appeals, the Court filed unanimously that the complaint did allege a per se violation of the Sherman Act and hands on the pleadings, reversed the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.464" offset="597243">However the Court sua sponte without the issue of having been argued, grieved, or raised at any time during the proceedings in a two-to-one opinion invoke the doctrine of primary jurisdiction and directed that the case be remanded to the District Court with the directions that the District Court stay proceedings pending reference of the matter to either the Commodities Exchange Commission and/or in the terms of the Court, the Secretary of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.117" offset="727855">I mentioned those facts because we do have here a case upon the pleadings although depositions had been taken by one side and are quoted in the briefs here by respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.001" offset="783339">The deposition testimony is not properly a part of the record and was rejected by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.715" offset="814268">We think, Your Honors that the extension of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction in this case involving commodities markets is particularly inappropriate especially with regard to this claim brought under the antitrust laws and particularly with regard to the policy in support of the private enforcement of antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.744" offset="918340">It may be well in determining what the primary jurisdiction or jurisdiction if you will of the Secretary of Agriculture is to determine what his powers are under the Commodities Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.798" offset="982601">First, the Act gives no exemption from the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.843" offset="1006738">Secondly, --</text>

            <text syncTime="227.335" offset="1012694">Let’s assume a rule of the exchange that it was authorized to issue and which was not disproved by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.991" offset="1043310">Let’s assume that one of those rules in anybody’s parlance would be a violation of the antitrust laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="272.060" offset="1191581">They submit the rules and if the Secretary doesn’t disprove them, the Acts are -- the rules are enforced, isn’t it?</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="283.443" offset="1237138">Well, let’s just assume, one of the rules about trading requirements otherwise would violate the antitrust laws?</text>
            <text syncTime="290.937" offset="1267127">Is that where that rule be vulnerable?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jerome_h_torshen" startTime="292.495" stopTime="882.746">
            <label>Mr. Jerome H. Torshen</label>
            <text syncTime="292.495" offset="1273396">Yes, we would think that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.584" offset="1281755">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.602" offset="1285831">Here we are not attacking any rule of the Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.823" offset="1306624">The allegations are that the actions of the exchange in consort with the number and again we’re not talking about the generalized action of the Exchange as a consort of its membership but the action of the Exchange and a member in specific violation of the rule constituted a violation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.804" offset="1398575">And if we examine the statutory scheme to see what the Secretary of Agriculture can do in addition to this ability if he so sees fit to disapprove certain rules pertaining to trading or terms and conditions of contracts, he can conduct investigations, make reports, obtain registrations, approve certain rules relating to minimum financial requirements, hold hearings with regard the manipulations of future’s prices, false statements and CEA violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.540" offset="1525530">He can suspend from trading and he can report for criminal prosecution violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.948" offset="1551130">Although, it specifically provided that he need not report what he considers to be minor violations of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.225" offset="1584253">Certainly, here what we have on the part of the regulatory officer is a generalize supervisory power to guard against certain trading abuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.359" offset="1636812">Not the power to setup or to establish any overall scheme or plan or even to enforce or protect against violations of those rules which are setup.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.689" offset="1686131">It’s a very generalized type of system, and there is nothing in the character and objectives of the Act which is incompatible with the maintenance of a private antitrust action for those sorts of violations that are alleged in this particular complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.331" offset="1764707">There is nothing in the regulatory scheme, which might enable the Secretary of Agriculture or the Commodities Exchange Commission which is sort of a femoral body composed of the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Agriculture and the Attorney General, their representatives with power which in anyway gives them power to enforce or consider antitrust objectives or antitrust claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.657" offset="1882049">The Court over the years has developed a number of standards or tests relating to the doctrine of primary jurisdiction granted it’s a flexible concept and no particular rule can be applied in any given case.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.095" offset="1955715">But there are standards which the cases have developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.089" offset="1971702">There’s a requirement of a pervasive regulatory scheme and I think here we do not have such a pervasive regulatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.498" offset="2009318">And the Court has been very careful to delineate an exemption from the antitrust law either specifically stated in the regulatory statute or implied therein and we have no such exemption stated in the statute nor in this general supervisory scheme to perhaps protect someone against cornering and manipulation do we have an implied exemption?</text>
            <text syncTime="502.234" offset="2112345">And it’s interesting to note in this regard what reference can be made to the legislative history, the Commodities Exchange Act and its predecessors were both drafted by Congresses which were well aware of antitrust laws and antitrust implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.831" offset="2182666">The predecessors came about during the debates on the (Inaudible) that act in which there were specific antitrust exemptions and the present Commodities Exchange Act was enacted by the Congress and debated contemporaneously with the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.195" offset="2244106">So certainly here, we’re dealing with statutes which were enacted by Congress which were well-aware of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.080" offset="2279737">And these statutes give neither to the Secretary of Agriculture nor to any other body the power to and grant an immunity from the antitrust laws, or to enforce that act immunity, nor do they give a mechanism to readdress a violation or to determine issues which might be brought under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.592" offset="2373778">In fact, it’s interesting to note that under the Act if petitioner felt himself aggrieved, he could bring a complaint before the Secretary of Agriculture but he would not have standing unless he was given the right to intervene to appear in support of that complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.653" offset="2449951">Moreover, we have no conduct such as we find in some of the other cases dealing with primary jurisdiction, which is of at least debatable legality which can be justified with reference to some broad plans set down by the agency or by agency action, or by the need within the particular industry for some sort of noncompetitive action imposed upon the members of the industry by the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.162" offset="2568025">We just don’t have it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.761" offset="2578369">Moreover, action in this ad hoc situation by the District Court acting as antitrust court cannot in any way disrupt he administration of the Commodities Exchange Act or impinge upon the regulation of this contract market.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.912" offset="2655065">We have here an ad hoc decision, which we ask to be made in connection with particular facts relating to this petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.660" offset="2694040">There is no question of uniformity of agency rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.593" offset="2709713">We are dealing with a past violation. Incidentally, it’s interesting to note that with regard to the powers of the agency in this case to give redress for wrongs to individuals, there are none.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.375" offset="2772825">The agency can issue a seize-and-desist order.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.480" offset="2785259">It can suspend from trading.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.826" offset="2794663">It can apply various similar sanctions or it can refer to the Attorney General for the prosecution of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.467" offset="2829249">But it can’t give the particular remedy of damages which might redress a private wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.392" offset="2856939">And in this particular case, when we’re dealing with a resolution of a fact controversy and the application of the antitrust laws there's nothing in the history or in the record or in common sense which might give to the agency a greater expertise than the antitrust court in deciding these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.930" offset="2939068">And it’s ironic to know, I think here as we stand before this Court, that even though people do not like to make work for themselves agencies are generally jealous of their prerogatives and their powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.649" offset="2993925">And we don’t see the Secretary of Agriculture here and the only member of the (Inaudible) that we do see here that’s a member of the Commodities Exchange Commission is the Attorney General who has filed his brief in support of petitioner’s claim as amicus.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.576" offset="3065710">Again, we’re not making an attack on the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.145" offset="3079920">We think the rules have been violated and they’ve been violated by the Exchange acting with one of its members not just because of generalized conduct of the Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.042" offset="3139584">We think Your Honors that there is no good policy reason that might protect this sort of anticompetitive behavior or to be used to permit the exchange machinery to be used to suppress competition on the exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.603" offset="3209801">We think we have nothing more here than a garden variety, conspiracy to exclude a member from the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.315" offset="3240626">Again, referring to Silver and the footnote in the dissent by Mr. Justice Stewart, we’re dealing with a specific act of a member of the Exchange setting up an independent violation of the antitrust laws as distinguished from the generalized conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.206" offset="3316172">We think this Court over the years has considered the policy of private antitrust enforcement to be an important one.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.226" offset="3360266">Certainly here, it would not surprise me if the Secretary of Agriculture would say that this conduct with regard the petitioner was a minor violation of the Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.998" offset="3407391">I don’t think that it rests upon the Government or governmental bodies to seek redress for every antitrust wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.652" offset="3445948">I think that’s why its been left to private parties and here we have a case in which there is a good example of a private party seeking redress and seeking enforcement of the antitrust laws in an area where only he can seek redress.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.827" offset="3506657">We think the action of the Court below, the Court of Appeals, in limiting and seeking to limit trouble damage action or to delay that action over a period of time really doesn’t accomplish the purposes of the antitrust laws certainly doesn’t advance the cause of justice in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.787" offset="3586487">And in all due conscience and propriety we think that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, a doctrine of judicial modesty should not be applied in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="904.807" offset="3722637">What is involved here is the application of the primary jurisdiction principle and in your recent decisions, I find the rule expressed as a judicial abstention where the protection of the integrity of the regulatory system dictates primary result to the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.572" offset="3797661">This was expressed in Philadelphia Bank and in Carnation Milk and in Silver, a decision to which I will more fully refer.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.726" offset="3834232">The important point in these instances that we don’t seek exemption from the antitrust laws, we seek and the Seventh Circuit did order a judicial abstention until the administrative agency had an opportunity to determine whether or not there was compliance with this particular exchange with its rules and with the regulatory system established.</text>

            <text syncTime="970.178" offset="3984071">The Exchange itself has a great, many self-regulatory rules which involve penalties and monetary redress.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.553" offset="4025553">The agency, the administrative agency, does not have a power to award damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.426" offset="4045093">But as this Court said in Pan American, if the regulatory system is sufficiently comprehensive and if it deals with the issues that are involved, the fact of an absence of remedy or full remedy in that instance did not violate the need for primary jurisdiction resort and in case Justice Douglas did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.504" offset="4137357">So holding there’ve been several decisions since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.598" offset="4149791">But let me just, briefly if I may, indicate the scope and character of the Commodity Futures regulatory system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.945" offset="4183124">It involves an important segment of our economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.455" offset="4197230">The quoted prices in a free auction market become the price basis for national and international trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.576" offset="4233697">It becomes the price basis these quotes from day to day, from hour to hour, from minute to minute of the prices at which the farmer sell their product in the country.</text>

            <text syncTime="1233.124" offset="5035865">Silver, you see found that the Securities and Exchange Commission did not have the statutory power to review particular instances of enforcement of exchange rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.410" offset="5089050">In 1968, Congress amended the Commodities Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.792" offset="5110575">The Commodities Exchange Act incidentally was enacted in 1922.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.537" offset="5129488">It was the forerunner of the Securities and Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.700" offset="5142131">It was the pioneer of marketing devices that will introduce then and were ultimately adopted by the Securities Exchange Act and the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.746" offset="5182360">And in 1968, in view of Silver which had been announced several years prior, the statute was amended number one to specifically grant the Secretary and the administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.055" offset="5235545">The power to disaccrue rules that where adopted and promulgated by the agency -- by the Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.085" offset="5267728">Secondly and most important to impose a duty upon the agency -- upon the Exchange to enforce those rules; and thirdly to require review of the enforcement of those rules by the administrative agency and in the event of failure of enforcement to provoke disciplinary action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.494" offset="5349334">The disciplinary action could take the form a cease-and-desist order, suspension as a designative contract market on which futures trading only can legally be performed or revocation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1326.402" offset="5408998">No damages, but you see in the Silver case, the court recognized that there was not this agency review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.146" offset="5451943">The court as a matter of fact spoke specifically about seeking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.542" offset="5473573">And antitrust function to be performed either by the administrative agency in review of the exchanges function or by the Court failing to find administrative review, the court then turned to the antitrust laws, but was quick to say that a different case would occur if agency review was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.942" offset="5559150">And also said, Your Honor that in the event, the agency review occurred that court would find like under the egis of the rule of reason, the exchange would have sufficient breathing spell -- a breathing space to function as a self-regulatory agency in a very important field and avoid the implications of antitrust claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.612" offset="5669804">The functions that the Commodities Exchange Authority and its exchange the -- in this instance the Chicago Mercantile Exchange performed are very, very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.307" offset="5720586">And I was pointing out they do have the functions of avoiding price fixing, of avoiding restraints of trade, of avoiding monopolization because of this obligation to avoid corners of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.290" offset="5780564">They are specific provisions in the Act providing for the prevention and prohibition of unfair methods of competition and of predatory practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.929" offset="5823091">There are specific provisions in the Act committing the exchange to past rules that limit competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.461" offset="5857259">For example, the Exchange and the Agency courses a cessation of futures trading for a period of time in the contract months to permit delivery of cash -- the cash commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.000" offset="5907414">This is an imposition of restraint on competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.221" offset="5920266">Secondly as I pointed out, there is this provision that the Exchange has always had a hundred years of limiting the fluctuation of prices on a daily basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.608" offset="5969795">This in the parlance of antitrust is a per se violation, but completely justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.866" offset="5994872">The Exchange does provide for hours of trade, time of trade, manner of trading in future’s contracts and all to assure that a free auction market is maintained where the quoted prices truly reflect the competing, contending, conflicting opinions of traders based upon informed judgment on economic factors that are reasonably presented in a very complex, a very complex on dynamic marketing situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1842.760" offset="7474448">That were violations of the rules or violations of antitrust principles that were covered by a good faith compliance with self-regulatory duties, then the case should go back to the court, to the antitrust court, for the administration of that remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.400" offset="7532962">And the Seventh Circuit I think very closely followed the Silver dictates by providing for a stay of the District Courts proceedings until the agency had completed its determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.253" offset="7600358">And the agency here is in daily contact with the Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.455" offset="7621151">We have two or three investigators on our floor everyday, all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.062" offset="7643617">We are constantly subject to reporting and investigating process and the Exchange has a whole staff of -- which we called Department of Investigation and Audits which is constantly involved in the marketing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.024" offset="7699519">It’s a delicate process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.399" offset="7704952">It’s a subtle process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.445" offset="7709132">It’s necessary to secure a price quote that does truly reflect the competing opinions on economic supply and demand factors rather than some arbitrary factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.128" offset="7763884">And arbitrary factors have a way of entering into the marketplace from time to time and all of this function is performed through our members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.802" offset="7802546">And therefore, the Ricci problem standing alone is not very important, it’s a membership dispute, but looking at from the context of the issue has now presented to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.150" offset="7855940">It means the difference between encouraging the exchange to proceed forcibly in its self-regulatory duties under the control of the agency and subject to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.565" offset="7905677">The agency is always subject to judicial review or to be subject to a great money harassments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.447" offset="7929187">Let me just point to the dilemma that faces the Chicago Mercantile Exchange right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.132" offset="7955937">In the last several years, two or three years, we’ve been suggested to possibly seven or ten suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.573" offset="7981641">Some for violation of our rule, some for antitrust violations, two of them pending in the Seventh Circuit, I think highlight what I would like to emphasize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.072" offset="8023646">In one case, the Exchange’s investigative staff watched the trading in a particular commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.910" offset="8047052">And at the end of a contract month, instituted proceedings, disciplinary proceedings, made charges of manipulation of the market and violation of its rules against a series of members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.853" offset="8094804">There were six weeks of hearings before the full 12 men Board of Governors that we have and everyone attended for six weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.160" offset="8124061">When we got through, we imposed the severest penalties in the history of regulation of the exchanges, yet we’re subject to a lawsuit in a District Court for having violated our rules in the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.861" offset="8174843">Take the other side of the coin, another case pending in this Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.689" offset="8190098">In this particular instance, another commodity and another time, in the midst of trading, we found a very large concentration of position growing up which would have distorted price quotations, which have preventive this market operating properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.737" offset="8258330">So the Board entered and order requiring liquidation of position, a divestiture of interest in the antitrust funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.594" offset="8285706">Liquidation of position, it was a proper move we thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.745" offset="8302320">It did resolve in the market totally liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.931" offset="8319143">No violent price fluctuations occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.466" offset="8329279">What was subject to an antitrust suit there?</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.027" offset="8339519">Both cases pending in the Seventh Circuit and we refer to them on our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.846" offset="8354774">Now, the Commodities Exchange Authority and the Secretary of Agriculture and the Commission are on our backs all the time with respect to all of these operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.627" offset="8393853">They are constantly urging us to deal frankly or vigorously with any instance of market disturbance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.670" offset="8426036">But when we do, we’re done then when we don’t we’re down and this is the dilemma that faces us if we are subject to constantly harassing antitrust cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.349" offset="8464802">Now, this Board has an opportunity of providing us with a principle that will permit us, vigorous self-regulatory powers and duties, and functions, and yet subjects us to whatever penalties are necessary because of any exchange their election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.898" offset="8538990">We don’t profess to be perfect and the system isn’t perfect, but it has worked and it has worked well and this now injections of antitrust attached and in this instance with a complaint that’s demonstrably false.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.112" offset="8595832">On the basis of depositions that were taken by both sides, not one side, depositions that were taken by both sides and presented to the District Court by both sides in their briefs which demonstrate that there was notice to this individual that there was an attempt to arbitrate and there was no denial of it.</text>
