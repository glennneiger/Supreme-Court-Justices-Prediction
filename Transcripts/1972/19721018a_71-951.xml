            <text syncTime="28.394" offset="216900">This is a condemnation action to acquire the leasehold interest of the Almota Farmers Elevator and Warehouse Company in a track of land required for the Little Goose Lock and Dam Project, a Corps of Engineers project on the Snake River in Eastern Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.113" offset="303835">The fee owner, the railroad in this case was not joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.529" offset="325465">For many years, the OWRNN Company had owned and operated a railroad on the north bank of the Snake River which ran through the little village of Almota.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.450" offset="385128">The Almota Elevator Company in 1919 went to the railroad and they leased 7,500 of an acre, three quarters of an acre of bare unimproved land, absolutely nothing on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.074" offset="463705">And under various consecutive leases from that date forward, the date of taking on May 26, 1967, the Almota Company continued to hold this lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.556" offset="517622">At the time of the taking, they held under a 20-year lease which had a term to expire on October 12, 1974.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence Earl Hickman</label>
            <text syncTime="138.341" offset="656697">No, it started out with 5-year leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.445" offset="665161">In fact the 20-year lease is the longest lease the company ever had.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.878" offset="682924">There was no renewal option in this lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.085" offset="695672">Now that’s actually what’s involved in the taking in this case and if it was only, this bare unimproved land that was involved here, we wouldn’t have any problem because the Almota Company isn’t arguing on the point that the valuation of this very leasehold is its use value for the length of the term remaining on the lease less the agreed rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.144" offset="795982">We have no argument over that.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.670" offset="810088">But shortly after the company acquired this property, in 1919 they went out on the property and they built a warehouse on this property to handle grain and some years afterwards, they built three crib elevators on this property and at some time later, it put up a concrete tank on the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.742" offset="922311">Now, it’s all of those improvements that are involved, it was before the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="221.768" offset="990438">These improvements under the terms of the lease and the treatment of the parties were the personal property of the elevator company.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.605" offset="1017814">The elevator company owned these improvements and it had the right to take the improvements at the end of the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.291" offset="1044564">But since those improvements were physically a part of this land, they were part of what the Government had to take in this condemnation action.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.052" offset="1087613">Now the real problem as we see it here in this matter is the valuation of these improvements.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.510" offset="1113422">Not the valuation of this very leasehold.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.803" offset="1130559">There’s a basic difference here in the duration of Almota’s property interest in this basic leasehold and in the improvements that’s essential to understanding of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.478" offset="1181236">In the leasehold, it’s obvious at the end of the term, the reason anything there left, is no property rights to value but the improvements at the end of the term.</text>

            <text syncTime="296.242" offset="1288338">What I’m pointing out now is that there’s a difference between the very leasehold and the improvements.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.666" offset="1305997">The Ninth Circuit Court didn’t appreciate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.454" offset="1317177">In the one case, at the end of the term all the rights were extinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.215" offset="1332224">In the other case, you’re still the full fee owner of these building improvements for their full lifetime as long as they exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="326.521" offset="1409442">For the purpose of what the Government has to take, the Seagren case cited in our opening brief says, they are part of the real estate but under the law of the State of Washington and we cited authority for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.286" offset="1448521">They are the personal property of the tenant and you have a very confusing situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.838" offset="1474748">The Government is taking real estate, you got to deal with this real estate and yet what the tenant actually owns, his personal property and you are going to have to value it and his ownership continues when the lease is up.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.350" offset="1524799">The Government has treated this as so we have no further rights in the property at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="617.039" offset="2571577">And in the stipulation that’s entered here and we did enter into a stipulation for the reason that the only difference between this ultimately was how do you value these improvements.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.255" offset="2612433">So we simply got together and we stipulated on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.517" offset="2625390">And if it was to be valued as determined by the Government, the value is set to be a $130,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="656.611" offset="2729775">But I’d like to get at it in a little bit different way there.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.198" offset="2756211">In both cases, on both valuation, stipulated values, it was the same property involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.764" offset="2778467">I want you to understand that because there are some contentions in here in the argument of the Government in the brief that would lead you to the contrary but the stipulation was the value of the land and the improvements.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.800" offset="2822562">That is the leasehold and improvements, in the one case it was a 130 and the value of the same thing and the other was 264,000, $274,625.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.261" offset="2868433">Now we get really to the tracks of the thing and that is the reason for this difference in value was a difference of opinion as to what elements of value were entitled to be considered in determining the value of these improvements.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.776" offset="2930500">It wasn’t any argument over this very leasehold.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.396" offset="2944920">Now, the question is what should be considered when it comes to determining the value of these improvements?</text>
            <text syncTime="718.674" offset="2978043">Now in the opening brief, we cited quite a number of cases on the proposition that in determining the fair market value of any property that you must consider, all elements of value you must consider all reasonable, probable uses of the property that affect the very market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.052" offset="3055574">Now, they don’t disagree with that but they don’t apply the law -- the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.734" offset="3074278">Now I cited the Olson in which this Court here lays down in very good language exactly what I’ve said and I had intended to read it but in the interest of saving time, I will proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.291" offset="3128508">Now, at this point in determining what these buildings can be used for, in determining what the elements of value that should be considered, I think you need to pretty well understand the structural nature of these facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.500" offset="3189321">Now, I mentioned that there were three crib buildings that were put up on the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.622" offset="3209906">If you understand what a crib elevator building is, it’s a wooden structure, it’s made of cribbing, we take, well for example 2 x 12 planks and a spike one on top of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.381" offset="3256926">And you continue that type of structure clear to the top of the beams.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.418" offset="3273017">Now, each one of these structures would hold 125,000 bushels.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.509" offset="3289422">That’s enough to fill 62-1/2, 120,000 capacity grain carts to give you an idea of the size of this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.338" offset="3320769">Now, there were three buildings like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.607" offset="3329755">To top that of, there was the concrete tank which would hold148,000 bushels, that would take 74 railroad cars at the same size to fill that.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.522" offset="3373432">Now you can realize and appreciate that there had to be very substantial and permanent foundations under these structures.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.805" offset="3402585">So when you get to the matter here of selling this property and determining fair market value, what’s the first and most important thing the buyer is going to ask?</text>
            <text syncTime="839.484" offset="3461308">He is going to ask what are the probabilities, what are the chances of continuing to use these structures right were they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.800" offset="3490565">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="848.011" offset="3495372">Because he knows, there is little or no value whatsoever to attempt to move them, probably nothing but junk value to try and move these buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.595" offset="3533720">That’s where the difference arises between the Government and ourselves in this case and that is in Almota’s view at that stage of the case, Almota has contended that there should be taken into consideration that the probable use of these improvements right where they were was very great that was a reasonably probable use and you’ll find in the stipulation that there were facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.925" offset="3675094">In other words, it was stipulated that was -- there was evidence to the effect that the railroad is a general policy, never refuse to renew one of these leases where railroad traffic was being produced for the railroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="1555.076" offset="6323702">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.213" offset="6348257">I’d like to discuss two or three essential matters with you if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.132" offset="6367901">First, let us establish that if we were to adopt appellant’s position in viewpoint urged upon us, it will necessarily and clearly dictate and require that his Court overrule the establish law of just compensation as set forth 26 years ago by this Court in United States versus Petty Motor Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.250" offset="6464345">Secondly, I’d like to share with you why the rule as enunciated in Petty is the proper rule and thereby why it should not be set aside and overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.866" offset="6510843">And lastly, I’d like to deal with some of the specific arguments in questions raised by petitioner Almota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.616" offset="6541876">Let’s turn our attention if we may then, the United States versus Petty Motor Company case cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.804" offset="6570611">This Court in Petty held that a tenants expectancy that its leasehold would be renewed upon expiration even though its lease did not provide for renewal is not a compensable element of value under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.359" offset="6644799">The Court further held that each tenant in that case was entitled the compensation measured solely on the basis of the remainder of its term which existed after its ouster.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.353" offset="6700805">This Court said, the fact that some tenants had occupied their leaseholds by mutual concept for long periods of years does not add to their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.423" offset="6745109">Now, the question arises is Petty binding in this case or is it distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.845" offset="6770709">Petitioner contends that it is distinguishable and therefore isn’t binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.016" offset="6795473">I submit that the Petty Motor case is directly in point despite the efforts of petitioners to distinguish it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.516" offset="6821386">In substance the facts are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.131" offset="6831940">The difference is pointed out by appellant and that difference is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.743" offset="6846360">He says “well after all, the tenants in the Petty case add no improvements considered part of the fee as is present in the instant case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.353" offset="6884812">But that does not change the legal principles involved, they are identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.222" offset="6908217">This Court in Petty held that the possibility of renewal is not a compensable element and made clear that this was because such a prospect of a renewal expectancy does not add to the tenants rights with or without improvements.</text>

            <text syncTime="2123.236" offset="8596355">In fact the petitioner repeats that in his brief several times and he says anything less than that is not just compensation under the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2145.773" offset="8686425">Now, the reason petitioner gets less than the full $274,000 is because the remaining $144,625 is not part of the value of the leasehold owned by petitioner and condemned with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.306" offset="8760613">That much of the $274,000 represents value that petitioner desires to add-on based on the mere expectancy i.e. renewal of its lease.</text>

            <text syncTime="2226.739" offset="9010343">They can set the7-1/2 years out under the lease and pay absolutely nothing, so could the Government.</text>
