            <text syncTime="69.196" offset="424722">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="72.188" offset="436738">The issue in this case is whether the court of appeals below erred in requiring Bivens plaintiffs to come forward with direct evidence of unlawful intent in cases that turn on intent, and in holding that reliance on circumstantial evidence, no matter how probative, is inadequate to overcome a claim of qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.723" offset="514897">In this case, the district court found that the petitioner in this case had supported his allegations, his First Amendment allegations, with facts and evidence that were concrete, specific, and nonconclusory.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.401" offset="565574">In reversing, the court of appeals ruled that the petitioner must also have come forward with direct evidence of intent, and that reliance on circumstantial evidence is insufficient to overcome a claim of qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.821" offset="623253">Now, there's no question, I think, that what the court of appeals means by direct evidence of intent is some evidence of an expression of intent that comes directly from the lips of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.319" offset="673303">As the concurring opinion below put it, a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.522" offset="694097">Now, I'd like to address just two points here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.822" offset="703292">First, that this direct evidence rule of the D.C. Circuit is contrary to this Court's consistent precedent with respect to direct and circumstantial evidence, and is contrary to logic, we would submit, and secondly, that this Court has available to it several options that will strike a more appropriate balance between the rights of the victims of constitutional violations to seek vindication in court on the one hand, and the interest of public officials to avoid the distractions that can come from an insubstantial lawsuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="286.059" offset="1292196">If we say... make that jurisdictional determination, and that means there is no qualified immunity defense, then the heightened pleading rule, the direct or indirect evidence goes out the window.</text>

            <text syncTime="633.054" offset="2680239">Well, we think that the direct evidence rule versus circumstantial evidence rule is contrary to this Court's consistent precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.091" offset="2712317">This Court has long held that there is intrinsically no difference between direct and circumstantial evidence, that sometimes circumstantial evidence can be even stronger, more satisfying, more persuasive than direct evidence, and that's particularly true when, in cases like this, Justice Ginsburg, intent is at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.824" offset="2791311">Circumstantial evidence is often the only kind of evidence to get an intent, and it's generally the most reliable, how people act, how people behave are often much more probative, far more reliable, far more enlightening about someone's state of mind than what they say about it after the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.674" offset="2858707">So in our view, this is an arbitrary rule whose only purpose is to eliminate Bivens cases, and I think we should bear in mind that the only causes of action that are actionable here, the only violations that are actionable here because of the official's qualified immunity, are violations of rights that are clearly established, and so this rule would require Federal officials and State officials to confess, to admit to have violated a right that they are presumed to know about.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.543" offset="2970198">We think this is likely to happen in the most extraordinary cases, and it would wipe out an entire line of Bivens cases, Bivens cases that involve some of our most treasured rights, the right... it would eliminate discrimination cases, racial, gender discrimination cases, the selective prosecution cases, freedom to associate, cruel and unusual punishment, and in this case the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.498" offset="3069986">We think that the public interest... and that's what we're trying to do, I think, is achieve a balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.114" offset="3092451">The public interest in assuring that violations of that type don't go unremedied is at least as strong as the interest in sparing Federal officials the need to possibly explain themselves when these rights are at issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="779.691" offset="3266740">Well, let me say, Your Honor, the answer... it's problematic after this Court's decision in Leatherman.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.653" offset="3286593">We believe, though that there are a number of options that would strike a balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.767" offset="3302998">Let me be clear here.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.506" offset="3306028">We believe that there is a legitimate policy reason to protect Federal officials from insubstantial lawsuits, that at least within the parameters of clearly established rights, Federal officials should be free to engage in the unflinching discharge of their duties, but when clearly established rights are implicated, as this Court has held, Federal officials should be made to hesitate, and so there shouldn't be a total immunity against these suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.105" offset="3408428">Now, what options are available to the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="817.977" offset="3419922">We think that no matter what option the Court takes, there are going to be certain meritorious cases that get dismissed, there are going to be certain blameless officials who go through some discovery, but I think what we should try to do is find a solution that minimizes both possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.288" offset="3493169">The Solicitor General in this case, the Government in this case has come up with a standard that we would embrace.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.062" offset="3516262">It basically... and I think it's... the Court has authority to adopt it because it's consistent with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, namely, and obviously the Government will articulate it better than I, but namely when a defendant comes forward with a qualified immunity defense, it's up to the plaintiff to give his story.</text>

            <text syncTime="958.658" offset="3982600">What's involved here is they're doing things that they had full authority to do which didn't violate any rights unless... unless... there was an improper motive behind what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.118" offset="4036412">Well, you're always able to allege an improper motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.140" offset="4048533">Any lawful action of an official can be unlawful if it is done for an unlawful motive, so I don't see that this is a case of easily protecting clearly established rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1181.026" offset="4872121">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.843" offset="4911305">With regard to the question of the court of appeals appellate jurisdiction which the court inquired about at the beginning of petitioner's argument, under the position that the Government took in Johnson and Jones, which you heard last week, this would be appealable, because it's a question that relates in some sense to the qualified immunity defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.214" offset="4984866">Under the narrow... the narrow view that only questions of whether the law is clearly established are appealable under Mitchell, then it would not be appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.991" offset="5023945">I think there's an in-between question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.592" offset="5034394">The thing that seemed to concern the Court most in Johnson and Jones was whether the court would have to look through... whether the appellate court would have to look through the record to see whether there were... whether factual issues were in dispute or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.329" offset="5081310">The ground of appeal in this case was that the district judge had failed to use the correct direct evidence standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.074" offset="5108268">Judge Green had interpreted the direct evidence standard not really to require only direct rather than circumstantial evidence, and the ground of appeal was that he was wrong as a matter of law, that the direct evidence standard, as the panel of the court of appeals held on the appeal--</text>

            <text syncTime="1260.779" offset="5191129">--I agree completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.248" offset="5196980">Our argument in Johnson and Jones was that if it's a question of law related to a qualified immunity defense, that that should be a different--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1271.253" offset="5233029">You have to characterize it as a qualified immunity defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.736" offset="5246926">If it's not, if it's like, I didn't do it, then it doesn't come out... then it doesn't come under qualified immunity and you don't have any reason to have any special rules of any kind.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul Bender</label>
            <text syncTime="1286.417" offset="5293633">--Well, our argument in Johnson was that the qualified immunity defense is there to protect people who did not violate clearly established constitutional rights, so you can state the qualified immunity by saying, an official who did not violate clearly established constitutional rights has qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.374" offset="5353506">If he stated--</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul Bender</label>
            <text syncTime="1304.816" offset="5367194">--Yes, right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.687" offset="5370746">If you say... but that depends on a broader statement of the qualified immunity defense than is necessary, so it's really a question of how you define the qualified immunity defense, and also a question of whether you want to limit appeals to the question of law, or whether you want to expand appeals to appeals that require looking through the record to see whether there are sufficient factual allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.982" offset="5447860">This question, the point I'm trying to make is that in this case it was really a pure question of law that related to a rule, that is, the direct evidence rule, that the Court adopted as part of its vindication of qualified immunity, and so it's not just any rule of law, like a statute of limitations, for example, interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.652" offset="5522570">It's a rule of law that was adopted in order to protect officials against suits in the area that the Court feels they should be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.908" offset="5551618">Ever since the Court... coming to the merits, ever since the Court has recognized the ability of plaintiffs to sue Federal officials for violations of constitutional rights in Bivens, the Court has been concerned, as has the Government, with making sure that while meritorious suits are permitted to go forward, the threat of litigation does not improperly interfere with an official's exercise of discretion, and the actual bringing of litigation, the burdens of litigation, going through discovery and trial, does not interfere unduly with... in insubstantial cases--</text>

            <text syncTime="1411.877" offset="5795497">Our view is consistent with the views of, I think, seven circuits that have looked at this question, and that is that the Court ought to adopt a standard requiring specific allegations of the basis for the claim of unconstitutional motive before you go to the discovery stage of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.150" offset="5880552">It's not a heightened pleading standard, because I don't think it's fair to call it a pleading standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.903" offset="5899569">I'm not sure the Federal rules permit you to make it a pleading standard, especially since Rule 9 says that intent can be pleaded generally, and therefore I don't think it's just... if it's in the pleading, it satisfies it, but even if it--</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul Bender</label>
            <text syncTime="1454.216" offset="5964875">--I think there are a couple of rules that provide a basis for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.486" offset="5981907">One is Rule 26, which gives a judge control over the discovery process, and which says that the judge can consider in, I think it's 26(b)(2)(iii), the judge can consider whether the burdens that the discovery is going to impose are worth it in light of the nature of the case and the need of the discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.800" offset="6059230">I think that a judge, in order to implement this Court's qualified immunity jurisprudence, and the feeling the Court has had that people should have the right to be free from discovery on insubstantial claims, that a judge could enforce a heightened specificity standard--</text>

            <text syncTime="1493.980" offset="6123909">I think you would say that a judge... it would be an abuse of discretion not to.</text>

            <text syncTime="1502.865" offset="6159435">Another possibility is Rule 7, which permits the court to order a reply so that when a defendant pleads a defense of qualified immunity in response to the complaint either through motion or through an answer, the court could order the plaintiff to file a reply to that supplemental pleading which would have to have the specificity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.013" offset="6260059">It's very much like... as Justice Ginsburg said before, it's very much like a motion for a more definite statement, although this comes from the special concerns of qualified immunity rather than the more general concerns of the motion for a more definite statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1602.450" offset="6557751">So what we would like to see is in response, and I think, Justice O'Connor, this is... this responds to your question... it certainly is possible for people to just say, he or she did it with an unconstitutional motive, but if you have a requirement that there has to be some specificity... what's that based on?</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.273" offset="6625042">Are you just making that up?</text>

            <text syncTime="1628.318" offset="6661300">You've got to give some objective basis, or some direct evidence basis if you have it, for saying that this was something that was done with an unconstitutional motive, and if the plaintiff isn't able to do that, then I think there's a very, very great likelihood that it's an insubstantial case, and the right thing to do would be to dismiss it as early as possible, as the Court has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.631" offset="6746459">I don't think that's an absolute rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.334" offset="6753355">There may be some cases where the judge would be convinced that it would be proper to permit the plaintiff to do some limited discovery because in the circumstances of the case it's not fair to force the plaintiff to plead with more specificity, given the circumstances, but I think those would be extremely rare, and I think you can leave it to the discretion of the district court to do--</text>

            <text syncTime="1691.328" offset="6913329">Right, and you must answer it with enough specificity to justify going forward, and I think you're right that that comes from the desire of the defense of qualified immunity to not have people forced to go through discovery on insubstantial claims, and that it is worthwhile testing whether the claim is substantial or not as early in the process as possible by that kind of automatic motion for a more definite statement, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.884" offset="7007475">The direct evidence rule, on the other hand, we agree completely with the petitioners there, although adopted for the purpose of serving the purposes of qualified immunity, that the threat of suit not interfere with lawful discretion and insubstantial claims not be a burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.653" offset="7058570">It really doesn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.965" offset="7063795">It filters out some cases, but it doesn't filter out cases depending upon whether they're more or less substantial, or depending upon whether they are in the area of unclear law or the area of clear law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.821" offset="7107262">It seems much more like an arbitrary rule that just filters out cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.163" offset="7120637">It's almost as if in medical malpractice cases, because courts will worry about too many of these cases being insubstantial and interfering with doctors' freedom of action, a rule were adopted which would say that they have to be based on eyewitness testimony of the medical malpractice rather than on other kinds of evidence.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael L. Martinez</label>
            <text syncTime="1763.066" offset="7200258">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.118" offset="7212484">I think it's important at the outset to note that we agree with the Solicitor General's Office with respect to the point that heightened pleading standard is misnomer, and the Court doesn't need to reach the so-called heightened pleading standard issue in this case because this case is really a heightened production case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.559" offset="7290224">This case came up through the district court when the respondents move to dismiss or for summary judgment, as almost always happens in these cases, as their initial response to the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.738" offset="7334946">They moved to dismiss or summary judgment asserting qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.640" offset="7350515">In response to that, the petitioner submitted several exhibits, along with some deposition testimony, and in reply the Government, who at that time was representing the respondents, responded with that as well, and the district court decided this case on a qualified immunity basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.622" offset="7422508">Now, it decided it in terms of applying what has been called the heightened pleading standard, and Judge Green disagreed with what the D.C. Circuit law is in terms of direct versus circumstantial evidence, but that was the basis it was decided on, and really this case is a heightened production case, not a heightened pleading case, although the rule has been called variably by various courts a heightened pleading standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.019" offset="7524072">It's important to understand that this rule flows out of this Court's decision in Harlow v. Fitzgerald and its progeny.</text>

            <text syncTime="3293.366" offset="13321480">But sometimes, there is a case, and of course, if when he's explained his point there is a case, why should you impose a greater burden on that plaintiff than any other plaintiff in the United States?</text>

            <text syncTime="3311.269" offset="13393055">The way that test would work would be a... when a complaint is filed, the Government would respond with a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment asserting qualified immunity, and this is only in motive-based cases, I hasten to add, asserting qualified immunity, and then to rebut the allegation of improper motive, the burden would shift to the plaintiff to respond with clear and convincing evidence that there was an improper motive, and we believe the application of that standard would help obviate this problem a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.620" offset="13522413">Under that standard, circumstantial evidence, we contemplate, would be permitted in, but it would still have to be very high circumstantial and direct evidence, because it would have to add up, as it does in a libel setting, to clear and convincing evidence to defeat a motion of qualified immunity where intent is a factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.482" offset="13593884">And finally, I would like to say that regardless of which of these standards you apply, if you decide to apply one of them, it's important to emphasize again that on the facts of this case, the actions of the respondents were objectively reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.304" offset="13669222">Indeed, a conspiracy is alleged in this case, but there's nothing in the record that even shows that these two respondents ever spoke to each other, let alone conspired, and it's important to keep that in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.632" offset="13714466">This case is Exhibit A, in our view, as to why there should be a heightened pleading or proof standard and as to why, as this Court said in Butz v. Economou, these insubstantial cases should be terminated quickly and promptly, and if there are no further questions, Your Honor, that completes my argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="3418.929" offset="13823657">One is that whether we call it a heightened pleading or a heightened production standard, this rule fashioned by the D.C. Circuit is contrary to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.875" offset="13859497">If they call it a heightened production standard, then it's contrary to Rule 56 in many ways, first, because not all inferences are drawn in favor of the nonmoving party, as the rule requires, and secondly because discovery is not allowed, as Rule 56 would ordinarily require, at least would give the district court discretion.</text>
