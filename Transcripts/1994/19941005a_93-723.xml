            <text syncTime="10.889" offset="188047">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.760" offset="203616">At issue in this case is the constitutionality of section 2252 of the Child Protection Act of 1984 as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.013" offset="236530">That section prohibits knowingly transporting, shipping, receiving, or distributing in interstate or foreign commerce or mails any visual depiction if the producing of that depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct and the visual depiction is of such conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.510" offset="318555">The text of section 2252 is set out at section 3a of the appendix to our opening brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.581" offset="342901">The Ninth Circuit held the statute unconstitutional on its face under the First Amendment because it held that the statute did not require an element of the offense be that the defendant knew the minority status of at least one of the performers engaging in sexually explicit conduct, but rather, according to the court, imposed strict liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.446" offset="438300">As a consequence, respondent's convictions under section 2252 were reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.350" offset="461915">We submit that the court of appeals committed error in this respect, because 2252 does require that the defendant know that at least one performer in the visual depiction is a minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.926" offset="512279">Consequently, we urge this Court to reverse and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with that proper reading of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="118.827" offset="619799">Perhaps at another time one could discuss whether the statute would be constitutional without a scienter requirement... that is, as a strict liability statute... but that's not presented by this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="163.206" offset="797327">If the Court were to decide that, that certainly would resolve the matter, but our concern with the Ninth Circuit opinion is that it made no effort, according to the dictates of this Court's decisions, to try to avoid the constitutional problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.014" offset="852602">It's certainly, as we understand it, not the duty of Federal courts to try to seek out a constitutional problem and resolve it if it's not presented, and we think that particular problem in the way the Ninth Circuit handled this case and its failure to recognize that normally scienter is presumed to be part of a statute even when there's no scienter requirement on the face of the statute, the Ninth Circuit's failure to use those two principles of construction, namely avoiding constitutional interpretation, and 2) reading this background assumption of the criminal law, namely, scienter, into the statute, caused it to commit error.</text>

            <text syncTime="234.719" offset="1083420">There are many readings that have been offered in connection with the statute, indeed, in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.372" offset="1105990">The Ninth Circuit held that knowingly went just to transporting and distributing and so forth, and didn't reach visual depictions.</text>

            <text syncTime="266.089" offset="1208912">It seems to me that it is also possible, because it's not clear from the statute how far knowingly travels down the paragraph, that it could include the entire provision, and besides, even if this--</text>

            <text syncTime="336.852" offset="1491975">1) Knowingly is in the statute, so it suggests something about Congress' regard for that level of scienter, and the Model Penal Code suggests that where a level of scienter is stated in a statute, it's appropriate to read that level of scienter throughout the entire statute unless there's something clearly to the contrary that would suggest otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.650" offset="1587165">We also think that knowingly is consistent with what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.852" offset="1603883">Looking at the legislative history, if there's any lesson that one can draw from the legislative history, it is that Congress wanted scienter in the statute, that it was not thinking in terms of strict liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="608.909" offset="2580132">Well, that's a very good question, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.297" offset="2593715">Let me say first that the lower courts have... the court of appeals did not address the sufficiency of the indictment issue, but on that very point, Russell v. United States seems to suggest, although we are not reading it in this way, that where a court imposes an element that was not on the face of the statute, then the indictment is insufficient if it does not have that element set out in terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.432" offset="2722238">But one can read Russell v. United States and subsequent cases to hold that the issue is where an element of fact is supplied, in fact, by a decision of the court, that the indictment that lacks that particular information is deficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.079" offset="2804889">In Russell, it had to do with contempt of Congress, and the question was, did the indictment adequately notify the defendant that pertinent questions had to be answered, questions pertinent to the subject of the inquiry, and what this Court said was, it is not sufficient in the indictment to simply follow the statute, the terms of the statute, track the statute, because the subject of the inquiry is not clear, and therefore the indictment has to provide the defendant with more notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.301" offset="2929755">But we think here, we have the term knowingly, and if this Court determines that knowingly in fact reaches the minority status of the performer, I don't believe that there would be a problem with the indictment, but as I said initially, this is something that the court of appeals perhaps is in the best position to sort out, and it was not presented to this Court for determination.</text>
