            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="8.551" offset="121032">This case is here on petition for certiorari to the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.822" offset="138064">In a civil action brought 1987, petitioners alleged that in 1983 and 1984 respondents had committed fraud and deceit in the sale of stock in violation of Federal Securities Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.388" offset="196369">The District Court dismissed the action following this Court's decision in a case called Lamp.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.546" offset="225000">The effect of which was to make petitioner’s suit time barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.161" offset="243494">After the judgment became final Congress enacted §27A (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which is the provision at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.318" offset="292082">It provides through reinstatement on the plaintiff’s motion on the any action commenced before Lamp was decided but dismissed after Lamp as time barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.120" offset="347253">If the date of filing of that action no late under Lamp would have been timely under applicable state law which is what some lower Federal Courts had been using as the standard before we decided Lamp.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.133" offset="403364">Petitioners move to reopen their case under the statute, the District Court denied the motion on the ground that §27A (b) is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.910" offset="442443">The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.095" offset="459161">Last time we heard argument with one justice not participating in the similar case Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. v. Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.532" offset="492911">At that time, we were equally divided on the outcome of the case so according to custom we affirm the judgment under review without opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.366" offset="524258">We granted certiorari in the present case to consider the question again with full Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.958" offset="542648">We hold today that §27A (b) violates the constitution separation of powers because it requires Federal Courts to reopen final judgments entered before its enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.777" offset="585907">Article III of the constitution, provides that the judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such Inferior Courts as the Congress may from time-to-time ordain and establish.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.936" offset="634600">This article establishes a judicial department with as Chief Justice Marshall said in Marbury v. Madison, “the province and duty to say what the law is in particular cases and controversies” he Framers crafted this charter with an expressed understanding that it gives the Federal Judiciary the power, not merely to rule on cases, but conclusively to decide them, subject to review only by Superior Courts in the Article III hierarchy.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.566" offset="741075">History makes clear that the right against which the constitution doctrine of separation of powers was meant to protect was not merely legislative reversal of judicial judgments but also legislative setting aside of judicial judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.202" offset="799589">In the 17th and 18th centuries colonial assemblies and legislatures often vacated final judgments and the populism that swept the country during the revolution increased the frequency of that practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.585" offset="849117">The period from about 1780 to 1787 saw a reaction against these developments and a sense of sharp necessity to separate the legislative from the judicial power motivated the Framers of the new federal constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.298" offset="903974">As Hamilton Road in Federalist No. 81, “a legislature without exceeding its problems cannot reverse the determination once made in a particular case that would may prescribe a new rule for future cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.937" offset="958518">Petitioners are correct that Congress can always revise the judgment of a Lower Article III Court in one sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.269" offset="983909">When a new law makes clear that it is retroactive a Court of Appeals must apply it in reviewing judgments still on appeal that were rendered before the law was enacted and must alter the outcome of the Lower Court accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.090" offset="1035213">However, once the judgment has achieved finality in the highest court in the hierarchy the decision becomes the last word of the judicial department with regard to that particular case or controversy, and Congress may not declare by retroactive legislation that the law applicable to that case was other than what the Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.052" offset="1115044">It is irrelevant that §27A (b) reopens final judgments in a whole class of cases rather than in a particular suit and that the final judgments reopened vested on the bar of the statute limitations rather than on some other ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.690" offset="1173558">Our decision have uniformly provided fair warning that legislations such as §27A (b) which establishes new law to be applied to cases already finally decided exceeds congressional power.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.508" offset="1220892">Apart from §27A (b) we know of no instance in which Congress has attempted to set aside the final judgment of an Article III Court by retroactive legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.467" offset="1260702">Congresses prolonged reticence would be amazing, if such interference were not understood to be constitutionally proscribed by the constitutions separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.253" offset="1299782">Accordingly, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.294" offset="1315977">Justice Breyer has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment; Justice Stevens has filed the dissenting opinion in which Justice Ginsberg joins.</text>
