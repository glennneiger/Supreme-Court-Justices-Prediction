            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="149931">We'll hear argument this morning in Number 93-1151, Federal Election Commission v. NRA Political Victory Fund, et al.--</text>
            <text syncTime="11.800" offset="197056">Mr. Noble.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence M. Noble</label>
            <text syncTime="12.611" offset="200295">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.563" offset="212102">This case presents two issues: first, whether Congress violated the Constitution's requirement of separation of powers when it appointed the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House as nonvoting ex officio members of the Federal Election Commission where all the decisions of the Commission are made by six voting members who are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, pursuant to Article II.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.847" offset="297262">The second issue is whether, if the FEC is unconstitutional, whether the actions taken prior to the Court's decision should be afforded the fact of validity as was done some 18 years ago in Buckley v. Valeo.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.577" offset="356194">The United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit applied a bright line rule to the separation of powers analysis and effectively said that the mere presence of nonvoting, ex officio agents of Congress on an independent agency of the executive branch was a violation of the separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.458" offset="427665">After doing so, the court declined to apply the precedent of Buckley v. Valeo, and felt that because this was a defense to an enforcement action it must give the National Rifle Association some relief, and therefore reversed the district court's finding of a violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.091" offset="494225">We believe that the court of appeals erred on both issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.882" offset="509376">The court's--</text>

            <text syncTime="97.808" offset="541141">--If the Court wishes, I can address that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.050" offset="554098">The Federal Election Commission was created in the wake of Watergate to be independent of the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.095" offset="582310">The statute itself talks in terms of the Federal Election Commission having independent authority to institute actions and to conduct appeals of cases under title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.082" offset="626195">The Solicitor General's position on this relies on a narrow reading of the word appeal to not include petitions for writ of certiorari.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="126.959" offset="657751">Well, I suppose you could read 28 U.S. Code 518(a), giving the Solicitor General authority, as not being inconsistent with the statute 437d that you rely on.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.138" offset="714385">In other words, the Commission can appeal every place except here, and when coming here, it has to be the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.365" offset="747299">I suppose you could give effect to both those statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="152.616" offset="760360">You could give effect to both those statutes, though I think that would not be giving full effect to the intent of Congress in establishing the Federal Election Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.313" offset="791080">First, I would note that 518(a) also talks about the Solicitor General's authority to appeal, and does not specifically mention petitions for writ of certiorari, and this Court has recognized that's a congressional grant of authority, and that Congress can limit that authority in specific instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.186" offset="858581">Here, where you have--</text>

            <text syncTime="182.659" offset="880524">--As a general proposition, absent some other declaration by Congress that litigation authority should reside in another agency, yes, I think that does cover it.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.234" offset="922842">But in our instance, we have a situation where Congress clearly intended the Federal Election Commission to be independent of the Department of Justice.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="201.621" offset="956383">Well, you're saying that appeals in 518 indicates that it comprehends writs of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.276" offset="983028">I thought that was your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_m_noble" startTime="209.057" stopTime="220.196">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence M. Noble</label>
            <text syncTime="209.057" offset="986058">The word appeal generally comprehends writs of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.580" offset="1008210">The word appeal is also used in our statute in title II authorizing the Commission to conduct appeals.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence M. Noble</label>
            <text syncTime="222.047" offset="1038094">Yes, but while that's a general grant of authority to the Solicitor General, we don't believe that it overrides the congressional... the words of the statute and also the congressional intent to afford the Commission its own litigation authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="236.265" offset="1094937">Well, it doesn't override, it, but the point is, the mere fact that your statute says appeals is not contradicted by, or a limited reading of that statute is not contradicted by 518(a), which goes out of its way to say, not just appeals, but the Attorney General represents the United States in suits and appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="256.470" offset="1175707">Yes, Justice Scalia, but again I think if you look at the intent of Congress, the way the statute's constructed, also--</text>

            <text syncTime="264.716" offset="1208726">I'm reading 518(a), and I'm reading 9010, and what do you do about 9040, which was enacted at the same time as the statute you're relying upon, which does say the Commission is authorized on behalf of the United States to appeal from and to petition the Supreme Court for certiorari to review judgments or decrees entered with respect to actions in which it is presumed to be provided in this section, which is not the present section.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.795" offset="1321053">There it goes out of its way to say, not only appeal, but to petition for certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="302.983" offset="1361804">In fact, that provision came into being in 1971, prior to the Commission even being created, and then what happened in 1974 when the Commission was created, that statute was just modified to substitute the Commission for the Comptroller General, and we don't think that Congress had any intent in doing that.</text>

            <text syncTime="400.902" offset="1753536">If I can address for a moment the question of title 26, and how... the reading that title 26 gives the FEC authority while title 2 does not would result in what we consider a conflicting scheme, because under title 26 and under title 2, the Federal Election Commission can bring suits for injunctive relief for violations of the public financing statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.057" offset="1842143">And under the Solicitor General's position, we would have a situation that if the FEC cited title 2, the Solicitor General would have authority in the Supreme Court, if the FEC cited title 26 as its authority, the FEC would have authority in the Supreme Court, and if the SEC... if the FEC, as is probably most likely, would cite both statutory sections, then you would have conflicting authority in the Supreme Court, and we suggest that that is not the scheme that Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.352" offset="1943289">The... what runs throughout our statute, the creation of our statute, was the idea that the Federal Election Commission confined itself in litigation involved with a sitting President, or a sitting President's opponent, and that there should be independence from the Department of Justice, from the Attorney General.</text>

            <text syncTime="2134.669" offset="8688524">The Solicitor General says that he can retroactively approve a cert petition filed by the Federal Election Commission, says that is like a protective notice of appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2213.453" offset="9003665">And of course if... in this case it would mean that the Solicitor General has the power to decide not to authorize it and to pull this case from this Court's docket by his own unilateral action.</text>

            <text syncTime="3480.309" offset="14071107">And that's what our submission is here, that the Court really, if we are correct on the merits, and the Commission itself is an unconstitutionally constituted body and therefore disqualified, we would submit, from enforcing a Federal regulatory statute in court, then the court can't just, I think in the words of the Harper case, disregard current law and allow the Commission to just go forward without interruption as the Commission would suggest.</text>
