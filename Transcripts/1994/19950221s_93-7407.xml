            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="86859">The second case is Robert O'Neal v. Fred McAninch.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.375" offset="116325">This involves the following situation, a defended is convicted of a crime in a State Court, he comes into a Federal Habeas Court and he claims that there was a constitutional error that infected the trial for example of his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.535" offset="204932">The Court decides he is right, there was a constitutional error, but still he does not get a new trial if the matter was harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.695" offset="249550">The question presented to us was under those circumstances who has to prove harmlessness or lack of harmlessness?</text>
            <text syncTime="49.727" offset="285703">Is the burden on the defendant to show it was not harmless or is it on the government to show it was harmless?</text>
            <text syncTime="57.974" offset="318722">What we decided is this, normally when you are a Court of Appeals or other court reviewing the transcript of a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.947" offset="354562">The judge should try not to rely upon burdens of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.220" offset="371698">The judge should read the transcript in the record and make up his or her own mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.933" offset="394581">In those rare instances where the judge ends up in grave doubt, then we think the burden is on the government to show that there was not harmlessness.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.039" offset="451006">That our reasoning that if that there was harmlessness that the burden is on the government, it shows that the error was harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.629" offset="477337">A reason is basically itâ€™s consistent with prior president, it makes the law uniform and for reasons that we spell out in the opinion it is consistent with the interest of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.685" offset="525507">Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justice Scalia have joined.</text>
