            <text syncTime="1186.249" offset="4898457">The proper analysis under Shaw or under this Court's prior precedents is whether the State is doing something for blacks that it would not do for others.</text>

            <text syncTime="1755.016" offset="7173513">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.983" offset="7205383">The plaintiffs in this case ask the Court to affirm the judgment of the district court that the Eleventh Congressional District was an intentional racial gerrymander that is at constitutional odds with the equal protection jurisprudence of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.663" offset="7260031">All parties in this case I think would agree with this opening premise: race-based remedies are a constitutional evil that will be condoned only on a limited basis, and if they're temporary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.720" offset="7316351">We have fallen in love with the assumption that race-based is remedial, and in this case the illness was not defined before the remedy was assumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.903" offset="7361073">The real world of this case is beyond much of what we have talked about here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.727" offset="7380299">The real world of this case is simple, and put forward in length in the district court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.259" offset="7406421">The State of Georgia was confronted with a regional plan of the Department of Justice that required maximization of black voting strength based upon a heretofore unavailable technology.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.141" offset="7462010">That technology allowed reapportionment to be done at a census block level with such scalpel-like precision that the races could be separated to achieve particular racial percentages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.012" offset="7525435">Not only within the district, but because of that precision, the Department of Justice made the assumption that the Voting Rights Act requires racial proportionality within the districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.460" offset="7583218">That is the only explanation for why Georgia would have been required to rip out the core of two traditionally established districts and to change from what they originally proposed to what ended up as the Georgia districting plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="1876.357" offset="7658869">Let's say that the Georgia legislature, anticipating that they were going to have some difficulty in retaining the white vote... let's say, the Democrats... decided that our loyal constituent, 90-percent voters for the Democratic Party, are blacks, so now that we have this additional district, let's make sure that we have a solid Democratic district, and the Eleventh District was drawn solely to have a solid Democratic district, and to include the most loyal Democratic voters.</text>
