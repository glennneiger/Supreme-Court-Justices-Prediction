            <text syncTime="13.431" offset="191517">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.514" offset="207817">The issue presented in this case is a straightforward one identified by paragraph 13 of the client's agreement which was presented to the Mastrobuonos... Antonio Mastrobuono, a teacher of medieval history, and his wife, an artist, and the client's agreement provision provides, in relevant part, this agreement shall be governed by the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.477" offset="355670">This is a choice-of-law clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.822" offset="381061">It then moves forward into a comprehensive arbitration agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.364" offset="403213">Now, the point I guess which we diverge on, myself and Shearson's counsel, is just essentially what was agreed by the Mastrobuonos.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.117" offset="478237">Parenthetically, to suggest that they agreed to give up any substantive rights knowingly is preposterous, but what they are said to have agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.235" offset="522749">They are said to have agreed to the Garrity rule by the first sentence of paragraph 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.521" offset="567889">The Garrity rule, a rule in New York of approximately 20 years, states essentially that arbitrators are not empowered to grant punitive damages, and therefore, essentially, resort must have to be taken to the judicial forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.038" offset="657959">You move to the next aspect of the agreement, the comprehensive agreement which relates to arbitration, and it is straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.247" offset="718772">They agree to arbitrate any controversy arising out of or relating to my accounts, the transactions with you, your officers, directors, agents, or employees, the grants that say they shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the rules in effect of the National Association of Securities Dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.831" offset="805081">Now, the point that we have sought to stress in our papers is that either the FAA is going to be employed or it isn't, so if the assertion is that the only judicial forum... the only forum in New York available for punitive damages to the Mastrobuonos is a judicial forum, because of the comprehensive nature of the arbitration, and the statements of this Court time and again that if punitive damages are to be obtained only in the judicial forum, then there is a preemption because Federal law applies--</text>

            <text syncTime="248.325" offset="1131089">There was language that indicated that as a matter of equity, or justice, or something, the arbitrator thought that punitives should be awarded, but it was not expressly stated that the arbitrator was interpreting the parties' agreement as permitting the award of punitive damages.</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="1202.422" offset="4947474">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.641" offset="5004317">In our briefs, and I think in the cases, we've spent a lot of time stressing the similarities between labor arbitration and Federal Arbitration Act arbitration, but I think there's one respect in which the two are different that's fairly central to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.949" offset="5053531">That is, in labor arbitration, the arbitrator's power is typically restricted to the interpretation and the enforcement of the collective bargaining agreement itself, and if a dispute arises between an individual employee and the employer based upon some other source of law... for instance, a title VII claim... typically that would not be resolved by the arbitrator, it would be resolved in a judicial forum just as though there were no collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.194" offset="5146527">Under... in commercial arbitration under the FAA, the thing is really fundamentally different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.126" offset="5166276">That is, you do have a contract here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.548" offset="5175993">It's certainly possible that the Mastrobuonos could have filed an action for breach of contract contending that Shearson Lehman had breached its contractual duties, but the arbitrator's authority is not limited to suits arising under the agreement itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.716" offset="5224581">Typically, the presumption is that the arbitrator will resolve disputes arising under all sorts of different other provisions of law that happened to involve the same transactions, and the arbitration agreement here stated that it would apply to all disputes arising out of or involving the petitioner's accounts, and consequently it was always within the natural contemplation of the parties that the arbitrator might ultimately be called upon to apply a variety of different bodies of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.715" offset="5336594">And therefore when the contract said that the contract, the agreement would be governed by the laws of the State of New York, it certainly implied that a breach of contract action would be governed by that law, but it certainly didn't imply that every aspect of every dispute between the parties would be so governed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.536" offset="5403886">And, in fact, here the petitioner has filed claims based on Federal securities laws, based on Illinois and Texas law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.680" offset="5428441">Obviously nobody contended that New York law should have applied to--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1326.202" offset="5442547">So in your view this is just strictly a question of contract interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1334.367" offset="5475252">--It's a question of contract interpretation subject to two caveats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.579" offset="5488105">First, that the policies underlying the FAA are influential in the interpretation of the contract, although they don't preclude the parties from agreeing to waive punitive damages if they wish, and second, it's our view that because this comes down to a matter of contract interpretation, ultimately great deference is owed to the views of the arbitrator, and therefore--</text>

            <text syncTime="1356.523" offset="5563860">But we don't know what those views are, because the arbitrator never said, this is what the parties agreed, and that's what I'm applying.</text>

            <text syncTime="1363.427" offset="5591445">--It's typically the case, Your Honor, that arbitrators will not give the reasons for their awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.558" offset="5612029">This Court recognized that in the steelworkers' trilogy, particularly in Enterprise Wheel, and the fact that the arbitrator doesn't make clear what the basis for his opinion is doesn't mean that we don't defer, so long as there is... in a sense it's like review of an act of Congress, and the question is whether we can hypothesize a valid basis for the award, rather than whether there is a statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1390.153" offset="5698338">But in those cases, Mr. Stewart, there was a great deal of talk about the law of the shop and that sort of thing, which is really peculiar to labor arbitration, and I don't think you have any factors like that here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1402.142" offset="5746299">It's certainly true that some of the factors that this Court has relied on in the labor cases in stressing the difference owed to the arbitrator are unique to labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.627" offset="5776287">However, this Court also recognized in Wilko v. Swan that the arbitrator's decision under the FAA is not subject to review for legal error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.072" offset="5810038">The Court has continued to recognize in McMahon, for instance, that the bases for overturning the arbitrator's decision remain limited, and the courts of appeals have uniformly been of the view that an arbitrator cannot be said to exceed his powers simply because the reviewing court believes that the arbitrator got wrong the question of contract interpretation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="1542.334" offset="6307096">--And the explanation was, I'm doing it for the reasons stated in the petitioner's brief, and I think probably the best indication... it's about a four-page brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.019" offset="6337816">It contains a number of arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.371" offset="6343249">One of them was, you can look to the spirit rather than the letter of the agreement, but even that was taken as a direct quotation from a New York court of appeals case which said, arbitrators can look to the spirit rather than the letter of the parties' agreement, so even that isolated sentence was not an appeal to ignore the law, it was simply a statement of what the law was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.682" offset="6420467">As to the First Options case, one of the questions presented is, if a district court denies a motion to vacate an award, what should the standard of review be on appeal, and the flip side is the question presented here, namely, when a district court grants a motion to vacate an award, what is the standard of review?</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.914" offset="6493401">The conflict in the First Options case is between the Third Circuit, which says de novo review of denial of a motion to vacate, the Eleventh Circuit which says an abuse of discretion review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.431" offset="6531435">But even the Eleventh Circuit in Robbins v. Day, which is discussed in the petition in First Options, said that when you have granted a motion to vacate, that should be reviewed but de novo, so I think under the standard of any circuit, the Seventh Circuit was correct in reviewing de novo the determination of the district court that the arbitrable award should be vacated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1643.661" offset="6712411">As I say, there were a number of arguments made in that brief, many of which are similar to the ones that we're making today, so it was not at all a brief which in its essence asked the arbitrator to avoid applying the contract, it was essentially a brief about how the contract should be interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.100" offset="6770194">I want to return to a question Justice Souter asked as to whether this is a case about the arbitrator's authority, and I think that there are two kinds of issues that may arise about authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.018" offset="6809796">One is arbitrability jurisdiction, whether a particular claim or grievance or cause of action was properly presented to the arbitrator rather than to the court, and certainly there are a number of this Court's decisions saying that the determination on that issue is for the court, albeit with a presumption of arbitrability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.027" offset="6873848">This is not a case about arbitrability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.368" offset="6883252">This is a case in which it is clear that the determination as to whether punitive damages should be awarded is to be made by the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.692" offset="6916480">The only question is, what standard of law should the arbitrator apply, and the Court has held in Enterprise Wheel, in Misco, in W. H. Grace, that when a claim is clearly properly before the arbitrator, the arbitrator's determination as to what remedies are appropriate is typically entrusted to his sound discretion, and that's particularly true here when the propriety of the remedy turns on interpretation of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.370" offset="7015223">That is, the respondents don't contend that the Garrity rule applies of its own force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.015" offset="7033822">They don't contend that there is some other provision of law which bars an award of punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.197" offset="7054511">They simply contend that the contract properly construed reflects the parties' agreement that punitive damages will not be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.770" offset="7080842">The question of whether they're right is a question of contract interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.613" offset="7096202">The arbitrator evidently reached a different determination, and that judgment is entitled to substantial deference from the reviewing court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.879" offset="7125251">As to Volt, we think really that's the fundamental difference between this case and Volt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.570" offset="7144059">In Volt, the State court determined that the choice of law clause was properly construed to incorporate California procedural rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.777" offset="7172898">This Court said, we won't review that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.019" offset="7185855">Assuming it's correct, the FAA does not prohibit enforcing the agreement according to its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.711" offset="7204558">Here, by contrast, the decisionmakers whose judgment is entitled to deference, namely the arbitrators, concluded that the choice of law clause did not have that effect... I'm sorry.</text>
