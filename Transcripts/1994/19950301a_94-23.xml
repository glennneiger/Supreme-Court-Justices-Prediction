            <text>We'll hear argument next in Number 94-23, The City of Edmonds v. Oxford House, Inc.--</text>
            <text>Refrain from talking till you get outside the courtroom.</text>
            <text>The Court remains in session.</text>
            <text>Mr. Snyder.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_scott_snyder">
            <label>Mr. W. Scott Snyder</label>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>This case presents the Court with one question.</text>
            <text>Are traditional zoning schemes, which set aside a portion of the community for the exclusive use of the family, as defined in accordance with the decisions of this Court, exempt from the reasonable accommodation requirements of the Fair Housing Act Amendments under section 3607(b)(1), exempting any reasonable local restriction on the maximum number of occupants who may occupy a dwelling?</text>
            <text>If Congress is to overturn over 70 years of Federal deference to local zoning decisions, and to limit communities' ability to set aside a portion of the community for the exclusive use of the family, we believe it should be required to do so in clear, unequivocal language stated on the face of the statute.</text>
            <text>As Justice Marshall stated in his dissent in Belle Terre, zoning is the most important function performed by local government.</text>
            <text>The city believes that the Eleventh Circuit's decision in the City of Athens case, using the exemption to permit a threshold inquiry into the reasonableness of local zoning ordinances, furthers a number of important policy considerations and meets the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text>First, to do so preserves the traditional deference which this Court and the Federal courts have given to local zoning decisions and legislative decisions allocating portions of the community.</text>
            <text>Secondly, such an interpretation prevents the FHA from coming into conflict, potentially, with constitutional concerns raised by the amicus Pacific Legal Foundation.</text>
            <text>Third, to do so permits the Federal courts to continue to prohibit exactly the type of discrimination referenced in the joint committee report, that is, Cleburne-type discrimination, in which groups of disabled persons are judged on a different basis or subjected to differing requirements than groups of other unrelated individuals.</text>
            <text>Finally, using the reasonableness standard, as opposed to the reasonable accommodation standard, prevents the Federal courts from having to make inquiries, individual fact-based inquiries, into the individual siting decisions of group homes based in large part upon the specific characteristics of a particular program.</text>
            <text>We believe that the Ninth Circuit was wrong in their decision in our case when it asserted that the vast majority of zoning ordinances would go unreviewed.</text>
            <text>The reasonableness standard which the Court has applied in a variety of constitutional cases, beginning with Euclid, provide a structural review of zoning ordinances which is consistent with the pattern of decisionmaking of this Court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, are you saying that the statute does nothing more than impose the constitutional standard on municipalities?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_scott_snyder">
            <label>Mr. W. Scott Snyder</label>
            <text>The Fair Housing Act Amendments accomplished many things.</text>
            <text>For example, it set up a conciliation and review process.</text>
            <text>What I point to, particularly in the joint committee report, is that the only case cited, and the only evil described with respect to what the Congress was trying to cure with respect to local zoning ordinances, was Cleburne-type discrimination.</text>
            <text>Cleburne is cited twice, both in the general comments and the specific section-by-section comments.</text>
            <text>There are other things, obviously, that the act did.</text>
            <text>For example, having the conciliation process provides an administrative structure, potentially lessens the burdens on the courts, and allows a way for disabled individuals to have their problems addressed with the assistance of HUD investigators.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Snyder, I may not understand your argument, but if all the... if the act's objective was limited to avoiding Cleburne, or Cleburne kind of discrimination, why would it also have put in the requirement of reasonable adjustment of the zoning ordinances to achieve the objects of the act?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_scott_snyder">
            <label>Mr. W. Scott Snyder</label>
            <text>The reasonable accommodation standard is most frequently discussed in the comments as they address structural issues: exiting, entrances, stairs, the same sort of barrier-free removal which have occurred in... through the ADA, for example.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>So you're saying the reasonable accommodations are just as you put, structural, physical, not doctrinal, certainly.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_scott_snyder">
            <label>Mr. W. Scott Snyder</label>
            <text>I guess the city's position would rely, perhaps, on a stronger point, we believe, and that's the plain meaning of the statute itself, and particularly the exemption.</text>
            <text>In our reply brief we cite Rice v. the Board of Trade case, which was a situation in which there was a general prohibition of a certain type of regulation, and then an exemption created for reasonable rules created in a certain area, the breadth of the exemption itself, which refers to any reasonable local limitation.</text>
            <text>Secondly, this Court and the Federal courts, as they've discussed--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But that isn't quite right.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_scott_snyder">
            <label>Mr. W. Scott Snyder</label>
            <text>--excuse me.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>It say, any reasonable.</text>
            <text>It says, any... doesn't it limit it to ordinances that control the maximum number of occupants?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_scott_snyder">
            <label>Mr. W. Scott Snyder</label>
            <text>Correct.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>So at least we've got to decide whether it's that kind of ordinance.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_scott_snyder">
            <label>Mr. W. Scott Snyder</label>
            <text>Yes, sir.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Yes.</text>
            <text>You haven't said--</text>
            <text>--Well, it says any reasonable local ordinance imposing a maximum.</text>
            <text>Is "reasonable" determined in accordance with the purposes of the act, or is it reasonable from the standpoint of general zoning laws, or do we know?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_scott_snyder">
            <label>Mr. W. Scott Snyder</label>
            <text>Well, I think there are probably two sources of law.</text>
            <text>When you see the word "reasonable", it implies a balancing test, obviously.</text>
            <text>We think that the first level of inquiry in terms of structural review would be to resort to the decisions of this Court, which in four or five decisions have looked at local zoning ordinances and determined certain attributes to be reasonable in a constitutional sense.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>You mean reasonable under the Due Process Clause?</text>
            <text>Is that the point?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_scott_snyder">
            <label>Mr. W. Scott Snyder</label>
            <text>That would be one of the standards.</text>
            <text>Again, I... the--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, I assume that's... that must be assumed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_scott_snyder">
            <label>Mr. W. Scott Snyder</label>
            <text>--Yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>I mean, any zoning ordinance has to pass due process muster, or--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_scott_snyder">
            <label>Mr. W. Scott Snyder</label>
            <text>Yes, sir.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>--So that doesn't help us much.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_scott_snyder">
            <label>Mr. W. Scott Snyder</label>
            <text>I think, as I said, there are several levels of inquiry.</text>
            <text>The second level of inquiry, probably an analogy would be best.</text>
            <text>There's a community immediately south of the City of Edmonds which is comprised solely of single family zoning, but which has an identical definition of family to that of the City of Edmonds.</text>
            <text>Applied... the same ordinance, or the same definition of family in that community, would work to exclude the disabled from the community.</text>
            <text>The key difference in the City of Edmonds' structure is that Edmonds affirmatively amended its ordinance to remove the Cleburne-type discrimination and to open other zoning districts of the city to group home use.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, my only question is, does 2 of your brief, do we determine "reasonable" with reference to the objectives of this act?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_scott_snyder">
            <label>Mr. W. Scott Snyder</label>
            <text>I believe it has a broader significance, looking to the structure and history of the purposes of zoning ordinances as developed over the past 70 years.</text>
            <text>The very nature of a zoning ordinance--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>If it has a broader purpose, does it also include the purposes of this act, or do we only reach the purposes of this act after we have found out that this is somehow a valid, reasonable zoning ordinance with reference to standards that are outside the act?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_scott_snyder">
            <label>Mr. W. Scott Snyder</label>
            <text>--The latter, with a qualification, sir.</text>
            <text>I think, again, reasonableness implies a balancing test, looking at both the law and the facts.</text>
            <text>It's not the depth of inquiry, that individualized fact-based inquiry that reasonable accommodation has been given under the ADA and other statutes.</text>
            <text>The very essence of a zoning ordinance is the ability of a community to distinguish and classify uses.</text>
            <text>An ordinance which set up unreasonable categories would be exclusionary in that sense.</text>
            <text>An ordinance which categorizes on a reasonable basis is definitional in nature and also is the very purpose of zoning.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>It seems to me that's the threshold question... maybe I'm missing something... that it's a particular kind of ordinance.</text>
            <text>It has to be one that relates to the maximum number of people that occupy the property.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_scott_snyder">
            <label>Mr. W. Scott Snyder</label>
            <text>That's correct.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>That's the only exemption, isn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_scott_snyder">
            <label>Mr. W. Scott Snyder</label>
            <text>Yes, sir.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>So you have to convince us, and maybe you're right, that this is such an ordinance, even before we decide whether it's reasonable.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_scott_snyder">
            <label>Mr. W. Scott Snyder</label>

          <turn speaker="w_scott_snyder">
            <label>Mr. W. Scott Snyder</label>
            <text>The respondents assert that because the Uniform Housing Code, which the City of Edmonds has adopted, is specifically mentioned in the comments, that that is the only, the sole and only type of occupancy limit that can be asserted.</text>
            <text>As we know--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, Edmonds, the city does have and has adopted a provision that would limit the maximum number of occupants based on the square footage per person available in the dwelling, right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_scott_snyder">
            <label>Mr. W. Scott Snyder</label>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And the argument of the other side is, that's the kind of ordinance this Federal law refers to.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_scott_snyder">
            <label>Mr. W. Scott Snyder</label>
            <text>Yes, Justice O'Connor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And not your definition of family.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_scott_snyder">
            <label>Mr. W. Scott Snyder</label>
            <text>That's correct, and I think that's the key distinction in the case.</text>
            <text>Three reasons or examples, I think, would be helpful at this point.</text>
            <text>The UHC, the Uniform Housing Code, is directly mentioned in the comments, but the plain meaning of the statute goes on to use "any reasonable limitation", to me clearly implying that there are other reasonable occupancy limits that can be employed.</text>
            <text>If they had meant to say, the UHC and square footage limitations they could... are the only type that could have been permitted, they should have said so.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>So you concede, then, that if it didn't have the provision for five unrelated members, if the definition of family in the Edmonds provision just meant individuals married, related by genetics, et cetera, and there was no provision for five or fewer, you wouldn't have a prayer of coming within this exemption.</text>
            <text>You'd have to work it out under the basic thou shalt not discriminate and thou shall make reasonable accommodations.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_scott_snyder">
            <label>Mr. W. Scott Snyder</label>
            <text>In addition to having Belle Terre problem, that's correct, Your Honor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, I... I'm sorry, I'm so far behind the curve on this one, I don't even understand what violation you need an exemption from.</text>
            <text>You come in arguing that you come in within the exemption.</text>
            <text>What is the violation that you have to be exempted from?</text>

          <turn speaker="w_scott_snyder">
            <label>Mr. W. Scott Snyder</label>
            <text>It is asserted by the Government, and has been since 1990, that the mere existence of a definition of family in the City of Edmonds which sets a limit on the number of individuals who may occupy a dwelling--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>What provision does it violate, is what I'm concerned about.</text>
            <text>The only provision I can find is the provision that says its unlawful to discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental because of a handicap, and then it defines discriminate to include a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services.</text>
            <text>It doesn't mention laws, ordinances... I note the Government in its brief in this case constantly refers to zoning rules.</text>
            <text>I never heard the expression, zoning rules.</text>
            <text>We always say zoning ordinances, zoning laws, but suddenly there's this category of zoning rules.</text>
            <text>Do you acknowledge that a refusal to make reasonable accommodation in laws comes within that phrase, in rules, policies, practices, or services?</text>
            <text>It's a very strange way to put it, isn't it?</text>

            <text>The traditional role of local governments in zoning has been, again, to categorize, and we believe that it's the interplay of the Uniform Housing Code which limits square footage from the bottom up, looking at rooms, bedrooms, and specific square footage requirements, as well as the traditional top-down role of local government to set aside zoning districts and regulate occupancy per lot per building per structure, and the interplay of those two specific types of rules and regulations work to establish the local government's role in occupancy limitation.</text>
            <text>State and Federal Governments have... may have different roles depending upon their specific interest in a subject.</text>
            <text>Again, I think the key from the city's perspective is the 70 years of deference to this type of decisionmaking.</text>
            <text>It's very difficult, or... communities assign and create zones and make classifications based upon a specific understanding of their particular demographic nature.</text>
            <text>As the record indicates, the average unit, family unit size or dwelling unit in the City of Edmonds is 2.41 individuals.</text>
            <text>The five or fewer unrelated individuals creates... it's basically double that number.</text>
            <text>It creates an area in which groups of unrelated individuals with or without disabilities can come together and establish household arrangements.</text>
            <text>The traditional role, as established by Euclid, for local governments has been to make those distinctions so that it can plan, so that we can make reasonable assumptions about the number of people who reside in a neighborhood, in a lot, and make density decisions, thereby planning, sizing water pipes, sizing sewers, knowing where the locate a precinct house or a fire station.</text>

            <text>It's been incorporated in the Growth Management Act for the State of Washington, RCW Chapter 3670A, or 36A.70, which also requires each local community to annually conduct a special needs population assessment to determine what the needs of the disabled are in each community and to plan for them.</text>
            <text>Now, we believe that that's the proper role of local government, is to take that big picture approach, determine how many group homes require siting, how much of a community needs to be set aside, and then to properly categorize those, where they belong in the community based on a neutral criteria as to how many residents they would have and what the other physical characteristics of a particular group home are.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_f_sheehan">
            <label>Mr. William F. Sheehan</label>
            <text>--That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>That is correct.</text>
            <text>In 1988, Congress extended the Fair Housing Act to handicapped persons Congress knew must live in group homes in residential areas.</text>
            <text>If the city's construction of the statute is correct, it means that all local governments across the country can entirely exclude all group homes entirely from their cities.</text>
            <text>Now, that is true not only for single family zoning, but it's for multifamily zones as well.</text>
            <text>All group homes for handicapped can be excluded.</text>
            <text>The city takes the position that its ordinance comes within the exemption because it's constitutional.</text>
            <text>So was the ordinance in the Village of Belle Terre case, which defined a family to mean two or fewer unrelated people.</text>
            <text>If the city is correct, every local government can adopt a Village of Belle Terre ordinance and exclude group homes for the handicapped completely.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, I suppose every local government could adopt a maximum, which could exclude group homes, if it's a maximum.</text>
            <text>The only question is, is it a maximum?</text>
            <text>That's what the statute said.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_f_sheehan">
            <label>Mr. William F. Sheehan</label>
            <text>The statute requires... the statute exempts a restriction on the maximum occupancy of the number of persons who can occupy a dwelling.</text>
            <text>The city construes that statute to allow the exclusion of all group homes.</text>
            <text>It would be remarkable if... in our view, if in a statute meant to extend the protective embrace of the Fair Housing Act to handicapped persons who Congress knew must live in group homes--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, the definition of family for the city that we're looking at does in one sense establish a maximum number of unrelated people who can live in a single family home, and the district court judge, Judge Dwyer, found that that established a maximum.</text>
            <text>The Ninth Circuit disagreed, but why was the district court's interpretation wrong under the statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_f_sheehan">
            <label>Mr. William F. Sheehan</label>
            <text>--It was wrong for several reasons, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>In the first place, it construed the exemption, as the city does, in isolation from the rest of the statute.</text>
            <text>Just yesterday in the Gustafson decision, this Court said that it's duty is to construe statutes, not isolated provisions.</text>
            <text>The city can point you to nothing else in the statute, or the legislative history, or its purposes and policies, that gives any indication that Congress meant to exclude group homes.</text>
            <text>A second reason, Your Honor, is, as you described the ruling of the district court, and as you described the city's position, you said that the city's definition of a family does provide a maximum.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Oh, you mean no maximum can exclude a group home?</text>
            <text>Is that your... no matter if the ordinance is a maximum or isn't, a group home cannot be excluded?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_f_sheehan">
            <label>Mr. William F. Sheehan</label>
            <text>Your Honor, if the maximum is written in terms of the kind of health and safety restrictions that housing codes typically impose, a group home can be excluded.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>That means you could build, you know, 80-story group homes in otherwise single family areas.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_f_sheehan">
            <label>Mr. William F. Sheehan</label>
            <text>No, Your Honor, but I have to jump ahead again to the merits to say why that's not correct.</text>
            <text>An 80-story group home would not be entitled to a reasonable accommodation, but the ordinance that would be subject to the 80-story group home would not be exempt from a merits review under the statute unless it were written in the terms that we say Congress meant to exempt, namely, proscriptions on... I mean to say, restrictions on the number of people who can occupy a particular dwelling based on health and safety concerns related to the space of that dwelling.</text>
            <text>Our construction of the exemption lives happily with the statute.</text>
            <text>It also lives happily with the Antidrug Abuse Act in which Congress mean to promote, to finance group homes like Oxford House for six or more people.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, can you tell me why this isn't a maximum?</text>
            <text>Is it because the family definition is openended as to numbers?</text>
            <text>It is controlled by related?</text>
            <text>Is that what makes this not a maximum?</text>

          <turn speaker="william_f_sheehan">
            <label>Mr. William F. Sheehan</label>
            <text>What makes this... what makes the city's ordinance fall outside the exception is that it doesn't fit into the language of the exception and it doesn't fit into the rest of the structure of the Fair Housing Act or the Antidrug Abuse Act.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text>You can under its housing code.</text>
            <text>So the city's zoning ordinance with... looking strictly at the words of the statute and thinking of nothing else, does not identify the maximum number of people who can occupy--</text>

            <text>Looking at the ordinance for a second, I guess we have a normal legal animal that's difficult.</text>

          <heading>Argument of Paul Bender</heading>
          <turn speaker="paul_bender">
            <label>Mr. Paul Bender</label>
            <text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justce, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>The only question before the Court in this case is, as both other counsel have said, the question whether Edmonds' definition of family that limits the number of unrelated persons who may live together in certain areas of the city, is a law regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling.</text>
            <text>The questions that were raised, have been raised during oral argument by Justice Scalia and others about whether zoning provisions are covered and about whether this kind of restriction can constitute a discrimination, are ones on which the Government has taken a uniform position and ones on which the decisions below are uniform.</text>
            <text>There have been no decisions in this Court.</text>
            <text>But those questions are not in this case.</text>
            <text>This is the threshold issue of, do you even get to those questions, or does the exemption just take it completely out of scrutiny under the Fair Housing... end of this case.</text>
            <text>Congress could easily have written this to also exempt this kind of unrelated persons provision.</text>
            <text>They're very common.</text>
            <text>Many communities around the country, a large percentage, have this kind of provision, and they simply could have said, the maximum number of unrelated persons, or the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling.</text>
            <text>By using the language--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Is it not true, Mr. Bender, that most of those cities that have a provision like this also have a maximum occupancy provision?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_bender">
            <label>Mr. Paul Bender</label>
            <text>--Right, and this clearly... those maximum occupancy provisions, the language you just used, Justice Stevens, is... are terms that are commonly used in the industry, and they are thought to refer to the kind of thing that Edmonds has and most communities have.</text>
            <text>Edmonds, I think, is that for each person in a bedroom you need an additional 50 feet.</text>
            <text>It's to stop overcrowding.</text>
            <text>It's for health and safety reasons.</text>
            <text>They're overcrowding provisions.</text>
            <text>They're density provisions.</text>
            <text>They're maximum occupancy provisions.</text>
            <text>That's clearly what this was intended to refer to.</text>
            <text>We don't think there's any need to look at the legislative history, but if you do look at the legislative history, it's entirely clear as well, because the only reason... this exemption came into the statute along with, in 1988, along with the prohibitions on discrimination against the handicapped and discrimination on grounds of family status.</text>
            <text>It wasn't in there before, and the reason it's in there is because it was feared that without this kind of exemption people with large families who sought to live in small apartments so that they would have five or six people in a bedroom, when told you can't do that because the bedroom isn't large enough for five or six people, would say, but you can't tell us that, because that would be a discrimination against us on grounds of family status, and this was put in there to make sure that people could not use the housing act to insulate themselves, to immunize themselves against their violation of health and safety regulations.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But the Government doesn't take that position, does it, that the exemption only applies to what it was, you tell us it was intended to cover, and that is, the family status provision, so you didn't have to bring in someone with eight children if the apartment doesn't have room for eight children.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text>You're saying it's authoritative for one purpose, it's not authoritative for the other, because that provision, the legislative history of the House report says section 3607(b)(1) amends the act to make additional exemptions relating to the familial status provisions.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="paul_bender">
            <label>Mr. Paul Bender</label>
            <text>--Right, and I think... if you think about it, try to think of, are there other provisions of the housing act that people might use to defend themselves against overcrowding limitations, and it's a stretch to think of them, but it would be possible.</text>
            <text>Somebody might say, somebody... a member of a minority group with a large family might say, large families are more prevalent in minority groups than anywhere else, and therefore you can't use your overcrowding limitation against me, because it has a discriminatory impact.</text>
            <text>The housing act, remember, includes discriminatory impact.</text>
            <text>It's not--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Perhaps they might say that having a large family was a handicap.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_bender">
            <label>Mr. Paul Bender</label>

          <turn speaker="paul_bender">
            <label>Mr. Paul Bender</label>
            <text>So that I think if somebody tried to use the handicapped provision or the race discrimination provision, or perhaps a religion would say that people should have very large families, and somebody would say well, my religion tells me I have to have all these children, and I can't afford a larger apartment, and therefore I'm entitled to violate the overcrowding provisions.</text>
            <text>I think Congress meant to say you couldn't use that provision of the statute, either, and that's because they thought that these overcrowding provisions and the debates in Congress are full of this, that these overcrowding provisions are so important, because they relate to disease, they relate to fire, they relate to epidemics, those kinds of things.</text>
            <text>They're so important that they should not be trumked.</text>
            <text>They should not be overruled.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, the reason for the overcrowding provision in a normal municipal ordinance applies equally whether the people are handicapped or not.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_bender">
            <label>Mr. Paul Bender</label>
            <text>That's right, and the reason is so strong that it overcomes the effects protection on discrimination against any of these, handicapped or others, if it applies.</text>
            <text>And I think that's also important, that principle is also important whether you look to see whether the city's view in this case is tenable, is being consistent with Congress' purpose and I think, as has been said, it's not, because if this ordinance were permitted to come within the exception, that would mean that cities could fence out handicapped people from living in certain areas of the city in those circumstances where handicapped people needed to live in congregate living arrangements in order to be able to live.</text>
            <text>No more than one would say that a city could, through a no-animals rule, or a no-pets rule, fence out blind people from living in that part of the city because they need to have a guide dog, would Congress have wanted to say that cities can say, handicapped people who need congregate living arrangements... and there are lots of groups of handicapped that do.</text>
            <text>The elderly handicapped, for example, mentally retarded people, AIDS victims, often need to live in these arrangements.</text>
            <text>They need the support of a minimum number of people in order to be able to live, especially with economic factors that mean that they have to share the costs, and so they need a minimum number of people to get the sufficient--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Bender, is it your position that any numerical limitation that has an exception is not a numerical limitation, because I mean, you know, you could read this ordinance, or you could write it differently.</text>
            <text>You could say, no house in this area of the city shall have more than five occupants unless it is a family.</text>
            <text>You know, make that one exception, so it's a five-occupant limit, but an exception for families.</text>

            <text>It's a maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling, not the maximum density of occupants in the neighborhood.</text>

          <turn speaker="paul_bender">
            <label>Mr. Paul Bender</label>
            <text>If... I don't understand the question.</text>
            <text>Under the Edmonds ordinance you can have a family and up to five unrelated people, but a family can be infinitely large.</text>
            <text>Remember, a family is not defined here as parents and children, or even parents, children, and grandchildren.</text>
            <text>It's anyone genetically related.</text>
            <text>We don't know what that means.</text>
            <text>There's nothing in the record to suggest it.</text>
            <text>But you could have five... three sisters and two brothers, each of whom are married, who get together in a congregate living arrangement.</text>
            <text>Apparently, they could live in a house, and then you could have a house exactly the same size next to it, and the 10 people in the Edmonds Oxford... in Oxford Edmonds House could not live there.</text>
            <text>That's exactly the kind of discrimination that Congress intended to prohibit by the Fair Housing Act, and that's exactly the kind of discrimination that would be permitted if this ordinance came within this exception.</text>

            <label>Mr. W. Scott Snyder</label>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, two points.</text>
            <text>This case has never been about whether disabled persons should be excluded from the City of Edmonds, but simply where within the community they should reside, given the numbers and institutional nature of the use.</text>
            <text>We believe that the Eleventh Circuit's position, or decision in the Athens case, applying a reasonable standard and looking at the factual basis for the ordinance structure, the overall structure of the scheme, is the proper way to approach it.</text>
            <text>It protects the rights of the disabled, and assures that they have a place in the community.</text>
            <text>Secondly, we believe that... as counsel stated a few minutes ago for Oxford House, he says the city can point to nothing in the statute which supports a portion of its position.</text>
            <text>We believe this is one of those legislative situations of someone trying to keep an elephant in their living room.</text>
            <text>It's simply impossible to ignore.</text>
            <text>We believe that the better interpretation would have been that had Congress intended to overrule traditional single family zoning, that it should have done so, and should have done so on the basis of the statute.</text>
            <text>We believe that there weren't the votes for that, that had this issue been addressed directly it might not have happened, that the Court should look to the plain meaning of the statute and determine what Congress did, not what policies or programs it might have promoted in a different statute.</text>
            <text>In 1990, citizens... pardon me, officials of the City of Edmonds sat with the HUD conciliator.</text>
            <text>They were told that their definition of family, because it had no limit on the number of related individuals, was a violation of the Fair Housing Act Amendment.</text>
            <text>Their question is the same question I put to the Court today.</text>
            <text>As they asked the HUD investigator, where in the statute does it say so?</text>
            <text>Thank you for this opportunity to participate in a unique national institution.</text>
            <text>Thank you.</text>
