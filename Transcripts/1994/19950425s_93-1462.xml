            <text syncTime="11.755" offset="133900">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in an essence it involves twice convicted murder who says that after I was convicted you had changed the parole hearing rules and that violates the ex post facto clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.465" offset="204640">Respondent was convicted of murdering his wife in 1980 while on parole for previous murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.317" offset="228046">He became eligible for parole in 1990.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.732" offset="241734">As required by California Law the Board of Prison terms held a hearing in 1990.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.280" offset="267961">At that time the board found respondent unsuitable for parole although the California Law in effect when respondent was convicted provided for annual hearings, parole hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.659" offset="317489">In 1981 amendment to that law allowed the board to differ respondent’s subsequent hearings for up to three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.102" offset="359285">In this case the board differed the hearing of respondent. After it found that the, it was not reasonable to expect the parole would be granted and another hearing during the intervening years.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.063" offset="427099">The board scheduled respondent’s next hearing for 1992.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.481" offset="448728">Respondent then filed this habeas petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.994" offset="462834">He argued that as apply to him, the 1981 amendment constituted and ex post facto law.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.387" offset="492405">The District Court denied the petition but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the amendment effectively increase respondent’s sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.488" offset="528767">In an opinion filed with the clerk today we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.829" offset="542142">The ex post facto clause is aimed at laws that retroactively alter the definition of crimes or increase punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.459" offset="576624">The 1981 Amendment has or had no effect on the punishment attach to respondent’s crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.886" offset="606403">It left untouched respondent’s indeterminate sentence as well as the substantive formula for securing any reductions to that sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.066" offset="643079">The Amendment simply altered the methods for fixing a parole release date under identical substantive standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.222" offset="675680">Respondent contains that there is some conceivable risk that the Amendment will effect the actual term of his confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.274" offset="707967">We conclude however that respondent’s speculation is insufficient to establish an ex post facto violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.940" offset="738583">The amendment creates only the most attenuated possibility of increasing the measure of punishment for the effected crimes, this showing his insufficient under the ex post facto clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.393" offset="788424">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Souter has joined.</text>
