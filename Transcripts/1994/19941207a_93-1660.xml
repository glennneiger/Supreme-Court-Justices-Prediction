I think the result would have been the same under Leon, because in Whiting, I... or Whiteley, what the officer presented to the judge in order to obtain the warrant was simply a bare bones affidavit, and in Leon this Court noted that that sort of situation would not be the sort that would be justifiable for the good faith exclusion to the... exception to the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.183" offset="1193405">I also think there's a distinction between Whiteley and this... in this case, and I think it's followed through in Leon, in that what the Court should look at, in Whiteley you looked at... the warrant began with an officer instigating it.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.593" offset="1255054">He went to the judge and obtained the warrant based on a good faith... excuse me, based on a bare bones affidavit, which Leon has said is something that the Court will not recognize and not allow the officers to rule on.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.500" offset="1298730">Here, the warrant was initiated by a justice court.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.686" offset="1311478">The justice court issued this arrest warrant when Mr. Evans failed to appear before the justice court.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.840" offset="1332063">The justice court put the warrant into the police system for the purpose of getting police assistance and arresting Mr. Evans and bringing him before the court, and it was the justice court's failure, I think that's clear from the record, to make the call to the sheriff's office and have that warrant removed once it was quashed, that is to blame for Mr. Evans' arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.687" offset="1415445">In that situation, I think the good faith exception does not require... the good faith exception applies, and the exclusionary rule should not be applied to suppress the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3407.370" offset="13774185">In a Leon situation, in effect, we are saying, well, the judge may have gotten it wrong, but as long as the police reasonably relied, we will in effect allow the evidence in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.963" offset="13836565">Why shouldn't we, if we accept Arizona's position, in a Leon situation say, look, we don't care that it's the judge who made the mistake, we want to induce the system to get judges who will be smart enough to get it right.</text>

            <text syncTime="3438.941" offset="13900409">No, indeed, Your Honor, because what Leon says is that we will rest on the assurance that some magistrate or judge doing his job made an assessment on probable cause, but if you look in the Leon decision at page 923, you'll find there are four exceptions to the exception, if you will, and one of those exceptions is if the magistrate abandons his job, or his responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.645" offset="14039276">So I don't believe... and the first one, very importantly, is where the police are guilty of submitting reckless or false information, and what the court, the Leon court said about that was that this would be a reckless disregard for the truth that they would not condone.</text>
