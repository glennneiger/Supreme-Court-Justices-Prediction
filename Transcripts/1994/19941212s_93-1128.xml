            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87378">I have the opinion of the court to announce in number 93-1128, Brown v. Gardner.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.939" offset="115068">After having back surgery at Veterans Administration facility the respondent Gardner who is a veteran of Korean War experienced pain and weakness in his left leg.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.418" offset="161043">He claimed disability benefits under the statute which requires the Veterans Administration to compensate veterans for an injury or an aggravation of an injury that occurs as the result of a Veterans Administration treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.097" offset="219662">The VA and the board of Veterans Appeals denied Gardner's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.997" offset="239306">On the ground that Subsection 1151 which is one of the sections of that law as interpreted by a VA regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.033" offset="271489">Only covers in injury if it resulted from negligent treatment by the VA or an accident occurring during treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.694" offset="302105">The Court of Veterans Appeals reversed holding that section 1151 neither imposes nor authorizes the adoption of the fault or accident requirement and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.639" offset="357902">In the unanimous opinion authored by Justice Souter and filed today with the clerk of the court, we affirm the judgment of Federal Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.395" offset="392906">The statute refer solely to a claimant's fault in not permitting compensation to those whose disabilities are the result of their own willful misconduct and without some mention of a VA's fault, it will be unreasonable to read the statute as imposing on the Veteran claimant the burden of demonstrating it.</text>
