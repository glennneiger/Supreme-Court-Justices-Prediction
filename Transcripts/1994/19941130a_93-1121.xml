The Schooner Peggy, if a final judgment is entered in a case that still is pending within the process, the appellate process, and Congress in the exercise of the legislative power changes the law at that point, under The Schooner Peggy and its progeny, I think it's clear that the court must apply the law as ordained by Congress rather than affirming its earlier final judgment that was rightfully rendered and conformed to the law which prevailed at the time that it was rendered.</text>

            <text syncTime="180.764" offset="867938">The issue that... or the... what this case calls for, I think, is to specifically identify the institutional interest of the court that requires separation of powers protection and requires the adoption of the absolute rule that was adopted by the Sixth Circuit, and that final judgments in final cases are absolutely sacrosanct and are forever beyond the reach of Congress, at least in private actions involving the adjudication of private statutory rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="257.377" offset="1174406">Well, actually, I think... I agree that the holding in United States v. Sioux Nation does not directly address the question that's presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.175" offset="1217665">In fact, I think for separation of powers purposes Sioux Nation was actually a more difficult case than is presented by section 27A(b), because 27A(b) clearly changed the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.162" offset="1269597">It made a substantive change in the law and provided a mechanism by which this case and the defined group of cases could be reinstated for further adjudication by the courts of the new statutory rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.242" offset="1321842">In another sense, Sioux Nation was an easier case, since the party defendant was the Government, the party who had the benefit of the prior judgment, and I think the Court opinion suggested that the Government as a litigant could waive rights but it might not be able to impose the same sort of waivers on other parties who are not the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="316.588" offset="1411285">Your Honor, I understand and agree that that language is in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.229" offset="1429884">However, I believe that that really addresses more squarely the due process argument in this case rather than the separation of powers issue, which I believe is really specifically why Congress should be prohibited from enacting a statute which authorizes the restoration of a case to pending status for further adjudication of rights that are created in that statute.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="342.885" offset="1516506">Well, that's certainly not what Sioux Nation said.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.787" offset="1524029">I mean, the case's own description of its holding does refer to separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.311" offset="1550152">It says that Congress'... this is a quote...</text>
            <text syncTime="354.423" offset="1562586">"mere waiver of the res judicata effect of a prior judicial decision rejecting the validity of a legal claim against the United States does not violate the doctrine of separation of powers. "</text>
            <text syncTime="364.251" offset="1601874">So we were using simply a waiver of res judicata by the Government as a vindication of the separation of powers validity of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.898" offset="1648477">Now, you may persuade us that's wrong, but that's at least what we said.</text>

            <text syncTime="379.110" offset="1661329">Well, Your Honor, I agree that that's what the Court said, but I do believe that this is a different case than Sioux Nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.406" offset="1690586">It is different because, again, the Court, or the Congress changed the law and created new rights, and I think the difference, or the constitutionality of the statute is illustrated by postulating a statute that very well may violate and be unconstitutional under separation of powers principles as well as due process principles, and that would be a statute involving private statutory rights that calls for the following:</text>
            <text syncTime="416.806" offset="1812108">The judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in Civil Action Number 1234 is hereby set aside and remanded for further trial or for retrial on the same facts and on the same law, with the further congressional admonition that you will continue to retry this case on the same facts and the same law until you obtain the result that Congress wants, to wit, judgment for the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.874" offset="1916389">Now, that is a statute that... involving private rights that I think would clearly be a judicial act, no change in the law, simply setting aside a judgment with an instruction to retry the case and attempt to come up with another result.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.787" offset="1988069">I--</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="461.456" offset="1990785">--Suppose Congress changed the statute of limitations and then added a second clause which said, res judicata shall not apply in any 10b-5 case that has been commenced after a certain date, and sets that date 5 years back, so that all cases can be reopened if they've been filed within 5 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="485.251" offset="2085975">That presents a little bit more difficult problem than is presented by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.686" offset="2111680">I think, again, referring to the institutional interests of the Court that are protected by the separation of powers doctrine, the Court has an interest in preventing impairment of the judicial power and the exercise of the judicial power, and I think there may be limits under the separation of powers doctrine for legislation which just wholesale reopens masses of cases that might overwhelm the judicial system.</text>

            <text syncTime="904.843" offset="3764291">The court of appeals holding in this case rests on the view that there is an indispensable attribute of finality in judicial decisions that is completely immune from any congressional action, and accordingly, the court found this statute invalid under the separation of powers doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.526" offset="3839001">Our position is that there is a sense in which judicial decisions do have an attribute of finality, but it is not in the sense that the court of appeals found it in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.733" offset="3883827">The attribute of finality of a judicial decision is fairly accurately captured by the opinions that were rendered in Hayburn's Case, namely, a decision of an Article III tribunal is not subject to further review in another branch of Government, the executive branch, or Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.285" offset="3954044">The courts cannot be required to render a decision that depends for its finality on another branch's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.631" offset="3983406">On the other hand, the differentiation in the Constitution between legislative and judicial powers does not prevent Congress from prescribing new statutory rights that may be enforced between private parties despice the fact that there was a final judgment entered between those parties under former law.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.145" offset="4069505">The essence of this case is that Congress has changed the statute of limitations--</text>

            <text syncTime="2619.147" offset="10621538">This Court has repeatedly said that the statute of limitations is an important part of the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.622" offset="10647451">It's the part... and this Court in Lampf decided that it was a part of the balancing process that Congress would have... the 73rd Congress would have engaged in when it decided how long people would have the right to bring an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.123" offset="10705443">My point is that neither the Government nor my opponent contends that there would be any difference in this case if it was the aiding and abetting defense, or the in pari delicto defense, or other aspects of the section 10(b) right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.802" offset="10764166">The other point that I would make is that this was very much like a bill of attainder.</text>

            <text syncTime="2672.843" offset="10836264">They named the plaintiffs that they felt... by name, by individual name, that they felt were unfairly deprived of their rights, they named the defendants by name who they said should not benefit by their greed, and therefore the decision by this Court should be set aside and, furthermore, there was considerable discussion... it's impossible to tell how dispositive it was... that certain Members of Congress were concerned about the fact that it would make it better for the Government if more plaintiffs won more 10b-5 cases because it would cost the Government less in terms of the savings and loan bailout.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.150" offset="10989551">So that very much like Klein, and very much opposite to the Sioux Nation decision, Congress was requiring courts to set aside their judgments in order to benefit the Government, in part.</text>

            <text syncTime="2985.753" offset="12087948">Congress has now taken away all of that effect.</text>
