            <text syncTime="40.858" offset="306544">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="45.732" offset="325979">The issue in this case is whether State courts may refuse to enforce remedies under two Federal statutes, sections 1983 and 1988 of title 42, in cases challenging State taxes when State courts and State procedures provide an adequate remedy for the underlying claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.334" offset="408422">The Oklahoma supreme court in this case held that State courts may refuse to enforce remedies under sections 1983 and 1988 in such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.900" offset="450635">It based that conclusion entirely on what it termed principles of comity in federalism, which it perceived to be embodied in the Federal Tax Injunction Act, which prohibits Federal courts from enjoining State taxes in cases where a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.337" offset="540392">The main consequence of that ruling in this case is to deny petitioners a right to recover their attorney's fees that they would otherwise have under section 1988.</text>

            <text syncTime="133.107" offset="675498">What if the State has administrative claims procedures in any case involving ultimately declaration or injunction of State taxes that you have to make this administrative claim first?</text>

            <text syncTime="149.649" offset="741640">Justice O'Connor, there may be... there may well be other consequences to the conclusion that section 1983 applies.</text>

            <text syncTime="162.248" offset="792108">I'm asking you, though, what you think about a State's administrative claims procedure, if you're right.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Allen</label>
            <text syncTime="168.760" offset="818126">--If a State has a procedure requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies in a tax case, which, by the way, Oklahoma does not, but if it did, this Court's previous decisions would indicate that in the 1983 action those exhaustion of administrative remedy requirements are... ordinarily cannot be enforced in the Federal procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="195.898" offset="926691">Well, in the tax area that can be very troublesome, and there... something else occurs to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.283" offset="944245">We have said in McKesson and like cases that a State does not have to have a predeprivation remedy for tax relief if there is a clear and certain and prompt postdeprivation remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.884" offset="1014567">Now, to allow the 1983 action would mean in every instance, I guess, a plea deprivation determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.302" offset="1064304">I don't see any reason why, in a section 1983 action... I don't see why it would be implied in a 1983 action that you necessarily had a predeprivation remedy.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="247.234" offset="1132013">Well, you're coming in claiming the right to declaratory and/or injunctive relief... State, you can't get these taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.819" offset="1174332">Now, that is in the nature, I think, of a predeprivation remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="263.422" offset="1196797">Well, let me simply repeat that that's not an issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.188" offset="1219785">I think that the probable outcome, if that was... if the issue was squarely presented, the logic would probably be that a person who filed a 1983 action challenging a State tax in State court before he paid the tax, and if the State court made a final adjudication that the State tax was unconstitutional, I do believe that section 1983 would entitle the taxpayer in that circumstance to injunctive or declaratory relief which would in effect preclude the State from--</text>

            <text syncTime="307.874" offset="1374534">And that's... you know, that's precisely what this Court has been careful to say the States don't have to do, that they can at least require people to pay their taxes and litigate later and follow certain claims procedures in doing so--</text>

            <text syncTime="339.023" offset="1499191">--Well, you raise a very pertinent question, but I think we have to be very careful here, because the point you just made was that the Court has been careful to preserve the right of States to... or at least the constitutional right of States, putting apart the requirements of any Federal statute, the constitutional rights of States to require people to pay their taxes before they litigate the ultimate question.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.117" offset="1583514">But what I am saying is that in my view, under section 1983, if you filed an action and there was a litigation that finally determined that the tax was unconstitutional... in other words, you had done your litigation, then it seems to me--</text>

            <text syncTime="1781.996" offset="7271102">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.592" offset="7313421">I think a very important question that is before the Court that has to be answered is, did Congress intend to impose on State courts the obligation to apply Federal remedies under 1983 or 1988 or otherwise in State tax challenges when a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy is available and may be had under State law?</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.627" offset="7409551">I submit that Congress had no such intention and did not accomplish that with 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.552" offset="7433271">The nature of this case is more than just an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.894" offset="7454691">The lawsuit was brought under the State statute that provided that anyone who wishes to challenge the constitutionality of a tax statute or the... or its violation under a Federal statute must give notice after it has been assessed or proposed to be assessed, must give notice, pay the tax under protest, and then may file a lawsuit in district court, the State's trial court, for its recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.691" offset="7561793">Now, the statute, of course, does not provide for injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.395" offset="7576631">Oklahoma does not, as do some States, have any specific statute prohibiting enjoining a State tax, although Oklahoma case law has on several occasions prohibited it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.771" offset="7618113">Declaratory relief has been allowed under Oklahoma case law against a tax if the tax is not yet due.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.367" offset="7652490">Once the tax is due and proposed to be assessed, however, the Oklahoma statutes provide basically two remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.803" offset="7686240">One is the administrative hearing remedy, which also can be used at the taxpayer's option to challenge a proposed assessment on any grounds, including grounds of constitu... State or constitutional questions or violation of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.972" offset="7750920">In addition to that remedy... by the way, in the administrative hearing procedure the hearing was held before the tax commission as an agency, and its order is directly the appealable to the Oklahoma supreme court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.402" offset="7800657">As an alternative, and this is what was used in this case, Oklahoma law provides that instead of filing an administrative protest, that the taxpayer can pay the taxes under protest, file suit in district court for the recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.258" offset="7852066">That is what has happened in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2078.110" offset="8455494">Isn't that the normal rule, because you could have two causes of action get you to the same result, but Congress wanted to give these civil rights plaintiffs attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.815" offset="8498335">And then the question becomes, well, why should you make an exception here?</text>

            <text syncTime="2092.679" offset="8513800">I certainly can't... as I... I will accept that because my expertise, if any there is with 1983, certainly doesn't go much beyond the tax area, but I accept that as a basic statement, but I believe that the difference is, and why not in this case, is because when Congress enacted 1983 and then they were aware, for instance, that in the tax area it was common that the only right that anyone had to challenge a State tax was in the nature of an action in, was to pay it and sue to recover it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.072" offset="8647338">More importantly, when the attorney's fee provision was enacted, Congress had already, in 1937, I believe, had already provided that... their restrictions against the Federal courts from interfering in State tax matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="2143.292" offset="8716196">Well, that, it seemed to me, which is a very strong argument, would argue for an exception to the no exhaustion principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.167" offset="8743782">You see, that's... the no exhaustion principle is read into 1983-88 via this Court's decision in Patsy v. Regents, and there were strong policy reasons for doing that, and reading that, and you have very strong policy reasons as to not to interfere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.010" offset="8815148">But don't... I mean, maybe the... I'm not suggesting this is a conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.081" offset="8831344">The policy reasons might read out the no exhaustion, and if they read out the no exhaustion, then the main policy objection to applying it is gone but for attorney's fees, and yet we have a basic congressional decision that you get your attorney's fees when something violates the Civil Rights Act as well as violating State law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2195.606" offset="8925489">I think that the... probably the answer to that is, if we take that approach, and you say well, we will... we could extend 1983, it's application to State tax matters, but we'll change our interpretation so that there's no... that you can have an exhaustion remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.301" offset="9004275">However, if you do that, I think that you're then going back and disregarding what the purpose of 1983 was, and whether or not it was ever intended to apply in such cases in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="2239.935" offset="9102809">In other words, the thing that's worrying me about this entire case is the... not this area, but what the impact is on some other area, and whether it's possible to create an exception here, and why would you?</text>

            <text syncTime="3001.883" offset="12150567">I mean, as I read 1988 it says the court in its discretion may allow the prevailing... why don't you just argue that it would be an abuse of discretion for Federal courts in cases like this to allow the attorney's fees... for State courts?</text>

            <text syncTime="3065.546" offset="12405209">But the only basis you have for saying that is because of the Tax Injunction Act, and now the Tax Injunction Act, you'd have to look into the policies underlying that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.392" offset="12448676">And then once I get to the policies underlying it, that's why I came back to the idea which is only experimental about the possibility that that act justifies doing away with the exhaustion requirement, but that's the structure of the argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="3104.659" offset="12561734">Every act of Congress is, and at the same time, we had a Congress wanting to make sure that there were substantive remedies available and usable for persons whose rights, substantive rights under the Constitution and Federal laws had been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.013" offset="12639161">They wanted to make sure that those people had a remedy, and of course when it initially was passed, even if the remedy was on the books, often it wasn't enforced till they provided a Federal forum and a Federal remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.841" offset="12690466">They certainly provided a Federal remedy now even if it's enforced in the State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.704" offset="12705930">But at the same time, that danger did not then, and certainly does not now exist in the area, the realm of State taxes, and that same Congress who expressed the policy under 1983 has also expressed a policy under 1341 that the Federal Government, including Federal remedies, should stay out of State tax matters basically only so long as there is an adequate remedy, to the contrary of what 1983 started out to be.</text>

            <text syncTime="3220.796" offset="13026296">It was one that... Oklahoma and Nebraska were two of the seven States that were all sued on the same day by the same people for the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.591" offset="13053463">This is part of it, Dennis and this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.413" offset="13064748">But I suggest that Dennis, when it came back on remand to the State courts, I understand that attorney's fees were awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.209" offset="13107902">I am not aware that the question of whether or not they needed to be for reasons, not whether the Commerce Clause provides a basis for 1983, but whether or not State remedies are adequate and therefore the State may not even entertain 1983 in the first place I don't believe were ever argued or considered in Dennis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.443" offset="13184807">So in that respect, if I am right and it had been considered, then I think your answer would... could be yes, it would have been a Pyrrhic victory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.220" offset="13227961">It didn't happen, and so I can't tell exactly, but I do believe that the danger to the States and their ability to plan and administer their taxes is quite substantial, and could be substantial if the Court were to open up 1983 to the point that it says Congress intended that you must apply any remedies that might be available under 1983 even though you otherwise have adequate remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.331" offset="13364425">It could cause, I believe, a great disruption in State administration of their own tax affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.817" offset="13394309">I do not believe that was the policy or intent of Congress, and I believe they showed that policy when they prohibited the very same thing, prohibited the Federal courts from doing the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.222" offset="13436000">So I would suggest that if we accept the petitioner's argument, it is to accept the concept that Congress intended to prohibit the Federal courts from interfering or supplying Federal remedies in State tax matters, and then at the same time, without ever saying so, they intended to mandate that State courts apply those Federal remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.510" offset="13537146">I do not believe that was the intent of Congress, and I believe that the decision below should be affirmed.</text>
