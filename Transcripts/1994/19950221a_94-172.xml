            <text syncTime="12.979" offset="192875">This case concerns the applicability of title 18, United States Code, section 1001, often referred to as the false statement statute, to statements of the petitioner made in the course of bankruptcy court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.937" offset="248777">Section 1001, of course, prohibits the making of knowingly false statements in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.164" offset="285662">Our position is essentially twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.017" offset="301022">If there is an honest debate over whether the term 1001 and/or related limitations placed upon section 1001 by the various courts of appeals that have reached this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.194" offset="405721">Very briefly, the petitioner's three convictions under section 1001 arose from three written responses made through counsel during the course of the bankruptcy proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.431" offset="450756">These responses were made to the bankruptcy trustee as a result of inquiries made by that trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.875" offset="476460">The first two convictions arose from answers to the bankruptcy trustee's complaint, and essentially those answers consisted of the words,</text>
            <text syncTime="93.673" offset="515644">"denied for the reason that the allegations in the complaint are untrue. "</text>
            <text syncTime="97.935" offset="532780">The third conviction arose as a result of a discovery dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="104.660" offset="559634">The answer to the complaint was signed by counsel and signed by the petitioner, but not under oath, and the discovery response was not signed by the petitioner at all, only signed by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.088" offset="605296">The discovery response arose as a result of the trustee asking for the production of certain documents from the petitioner, and the discovery response filed by counsel stated that the petitioner had turned over those documents to the prior trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.359" offset="670393">Later on in the bankruptcy court proceedings, the bankruptcy judge issued an order directing the petitioner to turn over those documents, and they were turned over.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.225" offset="705920">Nevertheless, the petitioner was indicted for 1001 as a result of that response in the discovery issue, and that comprised the third of the three convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.241" offset="749910">First, I would like to address the question that the determination of whether 1001 applies at all to the courts is a question that logically and necessarily precedes the determination of whether the judicial function exception applies to 1001.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.281" offset="818142">This issue is not just fairly included within the question presented for review, it is a necessary predicate to a determination of the propriety of the judicial function exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.900" offset="860565">Ours is a plain language argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.632" offset="871536">Congress used the word in 1001, "department".</text>

            <text syncTime="413.609" offset="1795435">And the Second Circuit in the Masterpol decision, when that circuit adopted the judicial function exception, probably set forth the most cogent explanation of that distinction, and the Masterpol decision stated that in viewing Bramblett and what it was limited to, it was limited to a statement made to the disbursing office.</text>
