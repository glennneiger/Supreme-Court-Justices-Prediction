            <text syncTime="71.112" offset="424827">Section 3124, title 31 of the United States Code, prohibits State taxation of Federal obligations and the interest thereon.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.062" offset="464638">This prohibition extends to every form of State taxation that considers in its computation Federal obligations or the interest on Federal obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.448" offset="510195">The question presented in this case is whether Nebraska's taxation of income received by a mutual fund shareholder derived from repurchase agreements involving Federal obligations violates section 3124, repurchase agreements which we believe, in essence, were transactions that in substance were loans between private parties secured by Federal obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.735" offset="611342">The Nebraska supreme court erred in holding that Nebraska's tax violated section 3124.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.231" offset="641330">The computation of Nebraska's tax did not consider directly or indirectly either Federal obligations or interest on Federal obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.430" offset="686052">The repurchase agreements entered into by the mutual funds which distributed income to Respondent Loewenstein were in essence secured loans in which Federal obligations merely served as collateral.</text>

            <text syncTime="157.390" offset="769957">Repurchase agreements are called repos for short, and they're in essence contracts involving the simultaneous sale and future repurchase of an asset, usually Treasury securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.463" offset="822202">Repos generally consist of what is a twopart transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.227" offset="841219">In step 1, the party that holds Federal securities, denominated as the seller, transfers the securities to another party, the buyer, in exchange for cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.176" offset="881030">In this case the buyer would have been the mutual funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.096" offset="892733">The second step consists of a contemporaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase the securities at the original sale price, plus an agreedupon amount of interest at a rate specified in the agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="206.058" offset="964622">The interest paid by the seller is based on prevailing market rates on loans or financing transactions of similar maturity and risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.649" offset="994924">In fact, it was stipulated below that the interest paid by the seller on repurchase is less than the interest rate accruing on the underlying obligations.</text>

            <text syncTime="229.861" offset="1059812">If you sell a bond that has a certain maturity price, and if, in fact, rates for other obligations have gone up, the money you get won't depend upon the face interest on the Government obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.979" offset="1136298">It will depend upon what the market is at the time, won't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="262.863" offset="1191782">The distinction here, Your Honor, is that the way the repurchase agreement is structured, that the funds in essence are never, the owner is entitled to the Federal exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.359" offset="1233787">What they receive is interest at a rate agreed to between private parties that really doesn't bear a relation to the interest rate, and more importantly--</text>

            <text syncTime="294.539" offset="1318528">It has to do with what the going market is, so I don't see how that's a point for you at all, the fact that the interest rate depends on market rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.931" offset="1460112">If there is a bankruptcy by the entity that is acquiring the bonds temporarily, then if it's the owner there would be one consequence, if it was a loan there would be another.</text>

            <text syncTime="375.959" offset="1644223">With respect to your concern regarding the treatment of the purchase agreements in bankruptcy, Congress has in large part, of course, dealt with that concern by an amendment to the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.377" offset="1681839">There may be purposes for securities law transactions to be viewed again as differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.375" offset="1705872">It's pointed out in the amicus briefs filed by the Investment Company Institute and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that not all repos are identical to the precise transactions involved in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="413.460" offset="1794166">Is that... is it extraordinary to have a different characterization for tax purposes than for other purposes?</text>

            <text syncTime="423.269" offset="1833454">I think the mere fact that when you look at repos themselves and that there has been a division of the characterization and treatment, depending upon the purpose served, even the bankruptcy decisions, the Bevill case, that discuss the characterization of repos for tax purposes recognize that there may be different reasons why a rule or a principle of construction should be adopted for tax purposes that is different than the concerns in a bankruptcy context.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.040" offset="1936481">And that, in essence, is why we think that the economic substance principle, which has been recognized by Federal courts, construing the exemption of repurchase agreements involving cases construing section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code, which deals with the exemption of interest on State and local obligations, and State court cases that have also relied on the economic substance analysis to look at--</text>

            <text syncTime="1593.928" offset="6516060">Since 1862, Federal obligations have been, by statute, exempt from taxation by the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.548" offset="6550542">Nebraska statutes begin by recognizing this exemption by providing a deduction from a Federal adjusted gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.904" offset="6583978">However, the Nebraska Department of Revenue has adopted an administrative ruling that essentially takes away that exemption in the case of repurchase agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.541" offset="6626506">That revenue ruling violates the applicable Federal statute and the Supremacy Clause, and the Nebraska supreme court reached the correct ruling when it invalidated that revenue ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.287" offset="6677497">The results... to reach that result, the Revenue Department says that you should disregard the way in which the parties structured their transaction and restructure it to fit their interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.109" offset="6732772">The Revenue Department's ruling does not comply with this Court's decision in Frank Lyons, which sets out basically a threepart test for determining whether or not the structure the parties have chosen should be respected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.587" offset="6786688">First of all, that case requires that it be a genuine multiparty transaction with economic substance, secondly, the form of the transaction must be based on business and economic realities, and thirdly, it must be based on taxindependent considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.032" offset="6860458">It may not have been structured that way solely to avoid tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.203" offset="6877177">The transactions in this situation, these repurchase agreements, meet each of those three tests under Frank Lyons, and accordingly the Government should be required to respect the form in which the parties have chosen to structure their transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3322.968" offset="13432239">It seems that the issue in respondent's argument is focused on the validity of the addback provision which Nebraska and apparently other States have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.183" offset="13461079">We believe the validity of the addback provision was established by the Court's decision in First National Bank of Atlanta v. Bartow County, and if that is the only argument that they have to present, we think that the Court can certainly reverse the decision of the court below.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="3345.381" offset="13521892">I have just one question about why Nebraska is not taking the position that California and some other States have taken that all of this is beside the point, because what Loewenstein receives is simply a taxable dividend from the mutual fund.</text>

            <text syncTime="3361.952" offset="13588138">Of course, that's largely a policy question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.028" offset="13600468">Our Department of Revenue simply, in looking at the cases, I suppose, from the other States, saw that the trend was to allow the passthrough of interest income earned by direct ownership of Federal obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.368" offset="13653862">We have not raised the issue, but I assume it's based on the trend in those decisions, but, of course, our position isn't binding on what other States may attempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.895" offset="13691897">There's been no decision, obviously, by this Court on that question.</text>
