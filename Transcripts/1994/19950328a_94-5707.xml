            <text syncTime="93.885" offset="526640">What they're saying is... the Solicitor General says, the more drugs you've got, the more right you have to an announcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.851" offset="550464">The less drugs you've got, the less right you have to announcement, and then the State's position is that if you're completely innocent you really don't have any rights at all, and I submit to you that that turns the Fourth Amendment on its head.</text>
