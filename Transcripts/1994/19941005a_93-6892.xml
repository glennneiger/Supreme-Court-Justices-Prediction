            <text syncTime="49.133" offset="332872">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="53.536" offset="350531">The issue in this case is whether a charged motive to fabricate may be rebutted under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) by seven out-of-court statements made after declarant had that same motive to fabricate.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.656" offset="406955">We are asking this Court to hold, as did the common law, that a prior consistent statement rebuts a charged improper motive only if that motive did not exist at the time the statement was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.914" offset="460036">The criminal charges in this case arose out of a bitter child custody dispute between the petitioner, Matthew Tome, and his ex-wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.321" offset="497652">The dispute involved their small daughter, who is referred to in the briefs by the initials A.T.--</text>
            <text syncTime="96.364" offset="521789">The first time the child mentioned any abuse was 14 months after it was alleged to have taken place, and it was coincidentally on the same date a child custody hearing was supposed to have taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.072" offset="576647">Six different witnesses were allowed by the court to tell what A.T. had told them.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.858" offset="603814">Their statements expanded considerably on the very weak testimony at trial of A.T. All of these statements were admitted as substantive evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.664" offset="647073">As the trial judge ruled in his order releasing Mr. Tome pending a decision of this Court, the testimony of the six witnesses about statements made by the child substantially caused the defendant's conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.556" offset="710602">The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the admission of the statements, all of the statements under 801(d)(1)(B), and set forth a balancing test under Federal Rules of Evidence 402 and 403 to determine whether the statements had probative value apart from mere repetition.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.774" offset="775491">They took into consideration three factors: 1) the strength of the motive; 2) the circumstances in which the statement was made, and 3) the declarant's demonstrated propensity to lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.254" offset="833378">The court of appeals failed to consider that the child had the same motive at the time she made her statements as at the time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.730" offset="871308">That balancing test, which was imposed by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, is inconsistent both with the plain language of the rule and the common law history behind 801(d)(1)(B).</text>

            <text syncTime="219.825" offset="1015713">The question is that in terms of rebuttal it did not meet the premotive standard, and it's implicit and inherent in the rule that any statement which is made to rebut occurs prior to the motive to fabricate.</text>

            <text syncTime="276.322" offset="1241620">The court has to make an initial determination similar to the determinations made in other evidentiary questions as to preliminarily whether the statement does in fact rebut, because if the court... if a party is allowed to present a statement which does not in fact rebut, even though they're offering it, it's a misrepresentation upon the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2864.609" offset="11594782">--Well, in many ways this case is reminiscent of the problem that the Court had before it in the Daubert case, in which a contention was being made that the old rule of the Frye case should be preserved under the Federal Rules of Evidence, which would allow scientific evidence in only when it's generally accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.966" offset="11708258">And in the portion of Daubert that was unanimous, the Court rejected that as inconsistent with the more liberal thrust of the rules and their very generous definition of relevant evidence that a more multifaceted nuanced approach rather than what the Court called the austere standard, a per se rule for all cases, should be adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.778" offset="11843468">It's very comparable, it seems to us, to the premotive rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.449" offset="11858201">If one contrasts it with the formulation in one of, I think, the more thoughtful recent cases, a Sixth Circuit case called United States v. Lawson, which is cited in respondent's brief, and appropriately enough was written by a district judge sitting by designation... if I can just read a little excerpt to the court from that opinion, written by now-court-of-appeals Judge Sir Heinrich for the Sixth Circuit in 1989, when he was a district judge, the approach that the Court took there was that the trial judge must examine the circumstances under which the statement was made and make a determination of the statement's... this is the prior statement's... relevancy and probity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.577" offset="12094661">While these factors are more likely to be found where the statement was made prior to the alleged discrediting influence, temporal probity should not be a condition precedent to admissibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.899" offset="12152026">Where there are other indicia of reliability surrounding a prior consistent statement that make it relevant to rebut a charge of recent fabrication or improper motive, then the fact that the statement was made after the alleged motive to falsify should not preclude its admissibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="3027.105" offset="12244813">As I understand it, if you proceed under this hearsay exception, the particular one, you don't proceed under the catch-all, to get in under the catch-all, particularly because of the confrontation clause, you have to have special indicia of reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.274" offset="12305522">In this case, I take it, because of this exception, you don't, but you say, that's okay, because what's supposed to happen here is just what you read.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.700" offset="12335197">What's supposed to happen here is that they're supposed to over to Article IV, to the regular rules on relevance versus prejudice, and apply that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.385" offset="12365917">All right, so I can understand that as a coherent picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.078" offset="12376679">Then when I apply it to this case, I say, did that happen here?</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.399" offset="12389949">My goodness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.731" offset="12395278">In this particular case, as I read it, there is a child, 6 years old, who is in the court, not being able to be cross-examined very thoroughly because she can't answer most of the time, and then when you look back at this particular set of evidence, if the relevancy we're supposed to look to is the relevancy to show lack of a motive, all these statements were made after the mother took the child, and the mother could have told the child in the car, hey, I want you to stay with me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.579" offset="12506664">So the relevancy seems small, and if you look at the prejudice, it looks like this was the evidence on the basis of which the defendant was convicted, so what I don't understand is, if in fact you're supposed to read this provision to incorporate or at least refer by reference, say, judge, look at this, if you're just saying it twice, fine, let it in under this rule, but go back and look at 403.</text>
