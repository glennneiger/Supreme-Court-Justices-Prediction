            <label>Mr. Barry Scott Richard</label>
            <text syncTime="78.873" offset="449052">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="90.811" offset="496804">This case arose out of the adoption by the Florida supreme court of a rule which prohibited attorneys from engaging in direct mail solicitation to victims of accidents or their survivors for a period of 30 days after the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.421" offset="563259">The district court declared that the rule was unconstitutional, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.366" offset="591053">In an unusual postscript to its opinion, the Eleventh Circuit stated that it was disturbed that it was required by this Court's earlier decision in Bates and its progeny to reach that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.235" offset="654479">The concern that was expressed by the Eleventh Circuit reflected similar concerns expressed by at least seven justices in full or partial dissents in Bates and the cases following Bates.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.625" offset="708082">Bates itself was a limited decision by its own characterization.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.846" offset="724905">It held only that a State could not entirely prohibit an attorney from engaging in what the Court later in Ohralik referred to as restrained advertising of the rates for routine legal services and nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.109" offset="790002">A year later, in Ohralik, this Court stated that the States had a critical interest in maintaining the high standards of professionalism in connection with attorney advertising, and in fact it permitted States to prohibit altogether an attorney from engaging in direct, person-to-person solicitation of any nature.</text>

            <text syncTime="187.704" offset="884356">Does Florida permit lawyers to solicit business in person?</text>

            <label>Mr. Barry Scott Richard</label>
            <text syncTime="192.525" offset="903687">No, ma'am, it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.787" offset="908702">In doing so, this Court in Ohralik noted that an attorney's interest in his or her remunerative employment was charged with only marginal First Amendment concerns, and that regulation of that type of advertising falls within the State's proper sphere of economic and professional regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.491" offset="995533">In Ohralik, the Court noted a significant distinction between the restrained advertising that the Court had permitted in Bates and what it referred to in an earlier case of Railroad Trainmen v. West Virginia as ambulance chasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.094" offset="1065959">The case this Court stated in Ohralik did not involve ambulance chasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.367" offset="1091037">Ten years later, however, in Zauderer and Shapero, the Court prohibited the States from regulating what in essence amounted to ambulance chasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.455" offset="1139416">In Zauderer, the Court held that States could not prohibit direct solicitation of clients based upon a particular legal problem, and in Shapero, the Court took another giant step forward when it held that States could not regulate the direct, targeted solicitation of particular individuals who had suffered or were about to suffer a particular legal problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="307.050" offset="1361770">What it said in Clark v. Community for Creative Nonviolence, and in Ward v. Rock Against Racism, and in Renton v. Playtime Theatres is that the issue, the principal inquiry in determining content neutrality, and I'm quoting from Ward, is whether the Government's purpose in control... is the controlling consideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="808.159" offset="3366198">In Board of Trustees v. Fox, in addition to saying that there is no least restrictive means test, the Court said this: it said, we have been loath to second-guess the Government's judgment regarding where to draw the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.418" offset="3423249">We take into account the difficulty of establishing with precision the point at which restrictions become more extensive than their objective requires, and provide the legislative and executive branches needed leeway in a field, commercial speech, traditionally subject to Government regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.819" offset="3492839">Well, at the same time the Court was saying that, it was saying with respect to lawyers... and this is just commercial solicitation, which in Ohralik the Court said was only marginally charged with First Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.550" offset="3547697">At the same time it said that, it essentially, in Zauderer and Shapero, gave the courts... gave the States no leeway... no leeway to deal with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.935" offset="3581238">It basically said, you don't have a substantial enough interest to consider it.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.287" offset="3598688">In fact, in Shapero, in part 3 of Shapero, which represented the views of only four justices but nevertheless was part of the opinion of the Court, it said you couldn't even deal with the format of the letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.284" offset="3646648">You couldn't even deal with the letter that was essentially a used-car type of an advertisement that said to an individual, free legal services, that made subjective predictions of success, that said, call me now.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.945" offset="3701297">Now, In Ohralik, this Court said that the State had a substantial interest in avoiding the potential that a lawyer, because of the lawyer's training and experience, could be overbearing with an individual, and yet, in Shapero, in part 3 of Shapero, it essentially said, you can use any type of enticement to get that individual to call you, and then you're basically free.</text>

            <text syncTime="1760.202" offset="7174328">Instead, when it comes to attorney advertising, the Court has interjected itself and Federal courts have interjected themselves to the point of saying, we will manage this issue, and we will allow the States whatever the other problems may be that the States ought to be able to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.882" offset="7241097">The real question here is, shouldn't the States be able to address whether or not an attorney, by the manner in which he is approaching individuals with whom he has no prior relationship, by the manner in which he is presenting himself and, in turn, the legal profession, and perhaps in turn the administration of justice, shouldn't the State be able to consider whether or not that has an unduly adverse effect upon not only that individual, not only a community standard of propriety in terms of privacy and tranquility, but upon the entire--</text>

            <text syncTime="1810.985" offset="7377457">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.357" offset="7395011">The fundamental premise of the commercial speech cases is that truthful, nonmisleading information is of great benefit to the listener, and that's what this case is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.995" offset="7441509">The letters at issue in this case are highly regulated by the Florida Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.210" offset="7462407">At page 12-A of the appendix to our brief, we set forth the extensive regulations about these letters... what they must contain, what they must say, the fact that the envelope and each page must be stamped "Advertisement".</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.977" offset="7513502">These are the least intrusive, the most discreet forms of communication, and the question is whether or not that mode of communication can be precluded by the Florida Bar for a period of 30 days during the time, as then Chief Justice Shaw of the Florida supreme court said, during the time when a person is most in need of the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.413" offset="7607230">And yes, the question of underinclusiveness, as Mr. Richard I think has now conceded, goes to whether or not this regulation directly and materially advances substantial State interests, and if one of those State interests is this theoretical privacy right, then how is that State interest directly and materially advanced by a rule which precludes the lawyer from sending a letter informing a person of his or her rights but allows the insurance adjuster or the defense lawyer to communicate with that person any time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2571.774" offset="10420617">Basically, the bar's argument is, is that that line of cases from Central Hudson through Ibanez should be discarded, or at least discarded as to lawyers, and that Bates, RMJ, and Zauderer were wrongly decided, and that really is the essence of what the bar is saying, and its other suggestions... the measure of an argument oftentimes is how far one must stretch to make it, and when the bar likens these lawyers' letters to sound trucks and residential picketers, trying to draw strength from residential privacy, from those kinds of analogies, I think that demonstrates how far the bar must reach to try to get around what the established jurisprudence is.</text>
