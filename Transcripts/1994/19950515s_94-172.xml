            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="7.832" offset="118095">The petitioner in this case was convicted of violating section 1001 of the United States Criminal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.130" offset="147353">The so called false statement statute because he made two untoward and false statements in a bankruptcy proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.602" offset="177237">The statute applies the false statements that are made “in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency” of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.703" offset="213599">The question then is whether a Federal Bankruptcy Court is a department or agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.500" offset="236796">40 years ago in a case known as United States against Bramblett, the court apply 1001 do a false statement made to congressional Dispersing Officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.606" offset="269188">In that opinion the court construed the word department to cover all three branches of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.051" offset="291026">Thus, even though a court is not normally considered an agency or a department, Bramblett indicates that the court system has a whole is in fact the department of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.360" offset="332195">Over the past 30 years however the Courts of Appeals while recognizing at the reasoning in the Bramblett opinion treated the judiciary as a department.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.323" offset="364064">Developed a judicial function exception, this exception distinguishes his false statements made in judicial proceedings which cannot give rise to criminal liability under 1001, from those maybe the court administrators which are covered by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.255" offset="419862">In this case however the Courts of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit refuse to follow the judicial function exception and held that Bramblett required it to affirm petitioner’s conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.246" offset="455806">We granted certiorari to decide the faith of the judicial function exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.227" offset="475660">Our review has convinced this that Bramblett was incorrectly decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.246" offset="491751">Therefore we are really presented with the question whether we should overrule that case and thus eliminating the needfor any judicial function exception or hear to that decision not withstanding our conviction that was incorrectly decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.034" offset="542951">If we were to reaffirmed Bramblett we would be require to repudiate the judicial function exception because it is unsupported by the text is a statute as construed in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.610" offset="585269">Because this is a sort of question about which reasonable judges often differ, it is not surprising, that our conclusion is not unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.726" offset="613691">The majority of six justices has decided overrule a Bramblett, but for different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.136" offset="635320">I have filed an opinion that explains our reasons for concluding the Bramblett was incorrectly decided but my explanation for overruling that case is joined only by Justices Ginsburg and Breyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.061" offset="678997">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in Part and concurring in the Judgment that is joined by Justice Kennedy and the Chief Justice has filed a dissent that is joined by Justices O’Conner and Souter.</text>
