            <text syncTime="7.849" offset="118232">Now, this case arises under the Securities Act of 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.192" offset="135577">That Act regulates the sale and the issuance of new securities that provides a registration of the securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.994" offset="166820">It also provides a number of different remedies for persons who are injured by violation of the Act, and whether remedies has the right to rescind, the right to undo a transaction after it has been completed and that’s contained in section 12(2) of the Act, and the question here is whether or not this rescission remedy applies to a private secondary transaction as well as to publicly traded issues and public transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.081" offset="299208">The right of rescission as provided in the statute is a very sweeping remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.449" offset="324599">It provides that a purchaser may rescind, if the purchaser finds that the prospectus that a company, the sale of the securities contain a misstatement or an omission.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.279" offset="387920">It’s a sweeping remedy because fraud on the part of the seller need not be shown; no need the purchaser show reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.630" offset="429403">The right of rescission applies even though a purchaser did not rely on the particular misstatement, even though he did not rely on the perspectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.009" offset="466914">This case involved the sale of securities in a secondary private transaction in an Illinois transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.553" offset="505053">The private company sold its stock the purchaser’s were called the Alloyd Company that was actually the name of the old company and was also the name of the new purchasing company.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.030" offset="554999">The sellers were called Gustafson.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.079" offset="563149">The parties had a contract which contains certain recitals with reference to the financial condition of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.701" offset="593661">After the contract was closed and the shares had been transferred, it was alleged that one of these recitals was a misstatement and the question is whether or not the right of rescission applies to this private transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.661" offset="653429">There are two different views in the Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.822" offset="666072">The Third Circuit and the Seventh Circuit disagree; we took this case from the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.394" offset="684358">In an opinion filed today, we reverse the opinion of the Second Circuit which held that this was a prospectus.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.102" offset="723228">We find that section 12(2) applies only where the seller has made material misstatements by means of prospectus and conclude that the word prospectus is a term of art referring to a document that describes a public offering of securities by an issuer or a controlling shareholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.963" offset="786653">The parties agreed that prospectus has this meaning under section 10 of the Act which governs the information required to be contain in a prospectus.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.916" offset="818523">In our view the term has the same meaning throughout the Act, and so we find that the definition is controlling under section 12(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="190.810" offset="850078">All over the term prospectus is defined to include a written communication that offers a security for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.254" offset="875887">We read in context the term communication as referring to a public offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.893" offset="898457">The contract of sale here and its recitations were not held out to the public and were not a prospectus as determine as used in the 1933 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.692" offset="933566">Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Scalia, Ginsburg, and Breyer joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.375" offset="956345">Justice Ginsburg has field a dissenting opinion in which Justice Breyer joins.</text>
