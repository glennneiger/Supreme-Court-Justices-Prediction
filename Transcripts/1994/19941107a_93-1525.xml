            <text syncTime="3069.455" offset="12426346">Insofar as this policy was concerned, the Government was completely inactive and uninterested, and that is why the argument, until the briefs in this Court, has been that there's Government action under the theory of Burton, which was a case in which, under very unusual circumstances, this Court did hold that the Government's inaction amounted to action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.904" offset="12520178">Burton has never been applied beyond the limited factual setting in which it occurred, and the last place to apply it would be in a case involving the First Amendment, where the constitutional command essentially is to be inactive, and to leave the decisions regarding speech to private entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.782" offset="12587678">The position that we think is supported by the cases is that in a case like this, when there is evidence that the Government has, in fact, influenced or affected the decision that took place, it is fair to say that the Government is responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.709" offset="12647342">But when the Government has not had any influence whatsoever over the particular action, in those cases when Amtrak has made a decision for purely business reasons, it ought to have the same freedom to act that its competitors enjoy.</text>
