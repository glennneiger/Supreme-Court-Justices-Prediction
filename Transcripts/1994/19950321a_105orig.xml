            <text syncTime="13.408" offset="199776">The State of Kansas is here this morning in support of the report of the special master in this case in all respects except for three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.531" offset="244289">This is a compact enforcement case.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.817" offset="257350">It seeks enforcement of the Arkansas River Compact between Colorado and Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.221" offset="287025">It is a Federal statute approved by Congress and signed by the President in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.125" offset="314611">Kansas is the downstream State, Colorado is the upstream State.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.195" offset="338852">The United States intervened in the case after it was filed as Federal agencies physically perform some of the reservoir functions involved in the Kansas claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.670" offset="384828">Physically, Colorado diverts ten times as much water as Kansas diverts in this basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.692" offset="416906">Colorado normally diverts all of the inflows to the basin at least once, and in most cases many times, before those... the return flows from those diversions reach Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.516" offset="472181">Kansas depends on those return flows and on the benefits of John Martin Reservoir, which was conducted in the 1940's about 60 miles above the State line, and whose benefits are apportioned by the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.110" offset="534562">The rights of Kansas under the compact are protected by Article IV-D of the compact which forbids material depletions of the waters of the Arkansas River in usable quantity or availability.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.685" offset="588896">Kansas claims three violations of the compact have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.439" offset="611884">The special master has agreed with Kansas on its largest claim based on increased post-compact pumping in Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.862" offset="645530">That violation amounts to some 400,000 to 500,000 acre feet of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.533" offset="676250">As the volume of this courtroom is about 3-1/3 acre feet, that amounts to about 140,000 volumes of this courtroom, inside the pillars.</text>

            <text syncTime="155.648" offset="768723">The second claim asserted a violation based on the Colorado winter water storage program.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.670" offset="804772">The study period for that claim is 1976 through 1985, a shorter period.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.676" offset="836851">Kansas' evidence showed a depletion over that period of 40,000 acre feet, or about 12,000 volumes of this courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.068" offset="878437">The third claim is based on the operations of Trinidad Reservoir on the Purgatoire River, a major tributary of the Arkansas River in Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.606" offset="920547">The amount of that claim was 11,000 acre feet over a period 1979 through 1984, which amounts to approximately 3,300 volumes of this courtroom.</text>

            <text syncTime="267.972" offset="1218029">With respect to the Trinidad Reservoir claim, he did dismiss the Kansas case at the end of its evidence for failure of proof, but the reason was that he believed as a matter of law that Kansas had proved the wrong thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.666" offset="1280828">We proved that Colorado had violated the operating principles adopted by the Arkansas River Compact Administration for the operation of this reservoir.</text>

            <text syncTime="1479.959" offset="6065938">Colorado similarly supports the master's report, but has taken four exceptions to the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.112" offset="6094568">I would first like to address some comments to the Court concerning the Kansas argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.801" offset="6121317">I wish to make it clear that the master did not make a finding on the amount of actionable depletion as to the post compact wells in Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.340" offset="6163531">Counsel's description of the amounts of depletion when he was discussing how full the courtroom might be, or how many times it might fill, were strictly Kansas' allegations at the close of the evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.452" offset="6227897">Second, with regard to Trinidad, Kansas sought to use Article IV-D to show a material depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.955" offset="6257990">However, it admittedly did not show that there was a material depletion to State line flows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.211" offset="6291009">Remember, Article IV-D is designed to permit additional beneficial development in both States of the unused water, and it is Colorado's position, and it was the master's determination, that Kansas had to show that there was, in fact, a material depletion to the water that would otherwise be available to Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.459" offset="6367913">Simply showing that operating principles had been violated... and I wish to point out, operating principles that were negotiated not between the State of Colorado and the State of Kansas but between the Purgatoire River Water Conservancy District, a governmental entity within Colorado, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the State of Kansas, principles which were then subsequently submitted to the administration for their imprimatur, or approval.</text>

            <text syncTime="1628.655" offset="6660694">It was a... what they were concerned about was, if you simply use the term, depletion, Kansas and Colorado might be here every year arguing about some small glitch, and you must remember that this is a river that has average... that has flow conditions that on the average are a number of, you know, 600,000 or 800,000 acre feet, but rise into the millions and drop into the 200,000 and 300,000 each year, so you have this huge variability in the system, and they didn't want us here all the time arguing about little numbers, so material depletion was intended to cover that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1666.346" offset="6811473">It was important to the framers of the compact that waters be usable in each of the States if there was to be a call, or if there was going to be a demand on John Martin Reservoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.738" offset="6857030">The idea was that there was water, as the compact was negotiated, passing Garden City, Kansas, unused, and they wanted to be certain that that water was developable in each State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.347" offset="6911469">They didn't want to have a situation where Kansas was making insistence upon Colorado for water when in fact they had supplies within Kansas passing unusable out of the area covered by the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.488" offset="6964028">The procedures... I want to make it clear, the procedures that were approved, that were included within this agreement among the district, the Bureau, and Kansas, approved by the compact, not pursuant to rules and regs authority inherent in the compact but simply approved as a resolution, those procedures did not prescribe daily operation for Trinidad Reservoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.254" offset="7063189">They were based upon Bureau of Reclamation studies that dealt with averages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1735.776" offset="7089206">The State engineer of Colorado did, in fact, terminate by order the aggrieved use of the operating principles, the allegation that those principles weren't being followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.000" offset="7142078">That order is in effect today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.119" offset="7150646">There is absolutely no reason to assume that it will not remain in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.504" offset="7168096">Colorado is not in the business of seeking to violate its agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.892" offset="7189726">In response to Justice Scalia, the parties did not treat the procedures as being part of the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.212" offset="7215012">In fact, as far as the State of Colorado was concerned, they were in agreement among three parties that it was brought to the compact in Colorado because Kansas requested approval by the Commission, voted aye that those procedures should, in fact, be approved by the compact and utilized.</text>

            <text syncTime="2522.833" offset="10237484">Without that complaint, it was already trying to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2577.201" offset="10454927">We weren't able to defend ourselves in that regard because we couldn't get an explanation of how the 1940 through 1949 numbers were derived.</text>

            <text syncTime="2744.811" offset="11125334">Kansas has predicated that claim on the theory that Trinidad operations have breached the compact, but the only relevant limitation that the compact imposes on new projects like Trinidad is that they cannot materially deplete usable flows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.987" offset="11182072">Kansas has made no showing that Trinidad has had that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.291" offset="11199313">Instead, Kansas has attempted to show that Colorado has allowed a local irrigation district to violate reservoir operating principles, but those operating principles are not a part of the compact, and hence their violation cannot establish a violation of the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.949" offset="11257931">Simply put, Kansas cannot predicate its compact action based on conduct that the compact does not forbid.</text>

            <text syncTime="2845.076" offset="11526470">Instead, what had happened here was the Bureau of Reclamation had formulated these operating principles in anticipation of the completion of construction of the Trinidad project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.932" offset="11565863">They circulated the operating principles to interested parties to see if they agreed with the operating principles.</text>

            <text syncTime="2887.069" offset="11694385">The record fully supports that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.521" offset="11704207">Kansas seeks to overcome the master's finding by arguing that Colorado should bear the burden of disproving Kansas' allegations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3335.156" offset="13486699">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.191" offset="13502895">I'd like to respond to the United States initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.512" offset="13528181">With respect to the winter water storage program claim, I believe that there is some confusion here as to the appropriate question that the Court needs to address, and that is, while there may be dispute about the quantification of the depletions of usable flow caused by the Colorado winter water storage program, we would assert for your review that there is no meaningful dispute with regard to the existence of depletions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.483" offset="13652002">We showed 40,000 acre feet of depletions of usable flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.851" offset="13669556">Colorado did not take it to the usable ultimate answer, but when it analyzed the 27 years of our general study period in which the program didn't operate, it still found depletions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.361" offset="13723577">In addition, their expert took our model and made modifications, made it better for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.864" offset="13757536">He still said it wasn't what he would do, but he could not make those depletions go away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.085" offset="13778434">It's a very robust result as to whether there are depletions or not, and before you now is not what is the exact quantification of those usable depletions, but whether there has been a violation of Article IV-D at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3423.012" offset="13838202">What's the utility of recognizing a... let's say a proof of vague violation when it's simply going to lead to damages and the vagueness there is going to preclude a reliable damage remedy?</text>

            <label>Mr. John B. Draper</label>
            <text syncTime="3436.188" offset="13890865">Because there are both retrospective and prospective remedies potentially available, and the prospective remedy is very important to the State of Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.579" offset="13944469">With respect to the burden of proof, we believe that by relatively clear implication the Court in Nebraska v. Wyoming has indicated that the appropriate burden is preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.791" offset="14017298">We believe that if you tilt the playing field by adopting a clear and convincing standard for enforcing compact rights, that you are favoring the defendant State, which in most cases will be the upstream State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.219" offset="14090963">With respect to Mr. Robbins' comments on the Trinidad operating principles, that they were not adopted under VIII, Article VIII-B of the compact, we would assert that they are just exactly the kind of procedures that are laid out in Article VIII-B(2), and that it is very clear that the compact administration was acting in compliance with that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.855" offset="14209559">He also asserted that there was no agreement between the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.824" offset="14225442">On the contrary, when this interstate compact entity makes a decision, it is an agreement between the States pursuant to the terms of the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.083" offset="14286464">We believe also that the Court's ruling in Texas v. New Mexico in 1983 is very instructive with respect to the utility of observing and honoring and giving effect to operating procedures such as those that were adopted for the Trinidad project.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.461" offset="14355949">It would save this Court from micromanaging the operation of Trinidad Reservoir as to when those gates should be open and when they shouldn't, it would solve other problems that are before the Court on these exceptions such as burden of proof, the question of laches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.088" offset="14418434">It's immediately clear when someone fails to follow a procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.791" offset="14437242">There is a baseline conduct that is agreed to, and where it has been approved by it, even proposed by the United States, the owner of the project, we believe that it makes good sense to honor that set of procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.272" offset="14515192">I would simply point out with respect to the laches argument that Mr. Robbins made that Colorado does have the burden of proof on its affirmative defense and that the key difference which the special master recognized in his report is the type of knowledge that they are accusing Kansas of having, and the knowledge has to be of a compact violation or sufficient to lead to an investigation of the existence of a compact violation, and not simply the existence of wells upstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.765" offset="14681226">That is a much more complicated and less direct piece of knowledge, and the assertion over the years in the reports that Mr. Robbins has referred to was that the primary if not only effect of pumping in Colorado was on the downstream surface diverters who had less water to divert in their canals.</text>
