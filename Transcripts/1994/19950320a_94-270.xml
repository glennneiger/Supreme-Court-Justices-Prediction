            <text syncTime="103.080" offset="562432">About a month before he made the false statements to the FBI agents, his coconspirator informed him there was a grand jury investigation going on, and he said he was concerned about what would happen if he was subpoenaed to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.297" offset="615199">At the beginning of the interview with the FBI agents, almost at the very early stages he asked, am I a target, a term which he later testified was known to be used by FBI agents in connection with grand jury investigations.</text>

            <text syncTime="277.464" offset="1259901">As I understand, as I recall your brief, an answer to that is that in fact 1512(b) in fact does not have the same kind of coverage that 1503 would have on your theory.</text>

I think the monetary penalty is five times as high, the term of imprison... the maximum imprisonment is twice as high, and there are differences of that sort between the two statutes that might make one... that might go into the decision as to which one to charge, but the main reason was that we felt that his conduct was aimed directly at the grand jury, and that that's what should be charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.220" offset="1794993">I'd also say that I don't think that it's appropriate to construe a catch-all provision such as 1503 by first looking to other provisions and seeing what the coverage of those is and cutting out holes from 1503 to correspond to other provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.320" offset="1855388">1503 has always been understood to cover not only some of the territory that the other provisions cover, but some of the territory that they don't cover, and where the conduct comes within the plain meaning of the omnibus clause of section 1503, there's no reason to then look at some other statute to see that even though it's within the plain meaning of that omnibus provision, we're going to cut a hole for 1512, or 1513, or 1508, or any of the other obstruction of justice statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1001.888" offset="4157612">Now, what the statute requires is that a defendant have knowledge of either an authorization or an application to intercept telephone communications, that he act in order to obstruct such interception, and that he give notice of the possible interception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.728" offset="4212992">Now, when you talk about the interception that might result from an application or authorization for wiretapping, the interception has to be understood to extend not simply to the initial period of up to 30 days that you can get an order for, but any additional extensions of that period that might be added, and respondent plainly thought that that's what had occurred in this case, when 5 months after he found out about the authorization he gave notice... he gave notice to the target of it in order to obstruct it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.988" offset="4333991">In our view, the term, "possible", there, was used to tie back into the first clause of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.231" offset="4354993">That is, it ordinarily will be the case that a defendant will not know whether interception actually is going on, and defendant didn't know that in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1083.342" offset="4483411">In other words, if the defendant goes to someone and says,</text>

            <text syncTime="1096.331" offset="4535343">That, I think, is clearly the meaning of the term "possible" in the statute, and I don't think there's any question that defendant violated... that respondent violated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.486" offset="4568048">Now, respondent says, and the court of appeals believed, that the term "possible" was a term of limitation on the statute, and that Congress wanted to let the people who disclose a statute with... a wiretap with intent to disrupt it should be... should not be able to be prosecuted if for some reason entirely unbeknownst to them the interception is not going on, or can't go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.502" offset="4672120">If, for instance, the target is deceased, if the target's moved to a new house and isn't at the same telephone number anymore, if the target's already been informed of the wiretap, and therefore wasn't going to be talking on the phone under any circumstances, or if the wiretap has expired, as happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.156" offset="4746726">But I don't think that there's any reason why Congress would have created a... would have written a statute, and I really find it hard to believe that Congress would have wanted to create those kinds of windfall defenses that are based on the fact that the defendant didn't know about the... didn't know about the fact that he's now saying precludes his prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1726.083" offset="7054383">The Government's construction of section 1503 is flawed in at least two distinct respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.517" offset="7080087">In the first place, simply on the basis of its terms, the Government through this prosecution ignores the significant qualitative distinction between the types of conduct that have been traditionally punished under the omnibus clause and the type of conduct it seeks to punish here, and in the second place, the Government's construction of the omnibus clause ignores its place in the statutory scheme of which it plays but a small part.</text>

            <text syncTime="2027.920" offset="8261762">And I think this Court's decision in In Re Michael, which was a contempt case but was also considering the question of the due administration of justice in which the Court said that even perjury in court was not necessarily obstructive of the due administration of justice unless it could be demonstrated qualitatively that there was a risk of harm, and all of the cases relied upon by the Government, have one of two defining characteristics that's just not present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.077" offset="8374402">In the first place, where the grand jury affirmatively exercises its authority to secure particular testimony, for example by a subpoena or by compelling the attendance of a witness before the grand jury, it's perfectly clear in those circumstances that wrongful conduct at that point has a substantial risk of interfering with the administration of justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2129.794" offset="8669273">The second defining characteristic, Your Honor, is affirmative conduct by the defendant that substantially raises the risk that wrongful information is going to reach the grand jury, and I would give as a paradigm example of that the bribery of a witness, or the situation in Hawkins, where the witnesses went out and caused a third party to pretend to be a fictitious witness to give false testimony, and there, by the defendant's affirmative endeavor, there is a likelihood that the false information that that defendant is relating will reach the grand jury and interfere with its process and, of course, that's not present here either.</text>

            <text syncTime="3385.650" offset="13692619">First, with respect to section 1503 and the questions that arose concerning Agent Carlon's testimony, section 1503 is a statute that prohibits endeavors, and the one principle that's been quite clear from this Court's decisions about the statute is it prohibits endeavors to obstruct justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.760" offset="13765135">Therefore, although it's not important whether Agent Carlon actually testified, what is crucial, especially in light of counsel's argument, I think, is that respondent himself testified at trial that he knew that the false statements that he made to Agent Carlon would be reported to the grand jury, and I think that's what makes it sufficient to violate the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.783" offset="13841204">With respect to section 2232(c), I think that I'd just like to make two other brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.018" offset="13866177">One is that the statute was clearly designed not just to address, to be retributive of an actual evil that occurred, an obstruction of an interception, but to have a broader deterrent effect.</text>
