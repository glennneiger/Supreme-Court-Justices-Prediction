            <text syncTime="22.080" offset="260335">The State of Arkansas is before this Court today defending its constitutional authority to encourage rotation in office of its congressional delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.387" offset="305579">Amendment 73, which would have accomplished that objective was ruled unconstitutional by the Arkansas supreme court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.760" offset="342986">The court held that Amendment 73 amounted to a qualification and, further, that the State of Arkansas could not add additional qualifications to those listed in Article I, sections 2 and 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.837" offset="403381">We disagree with that ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.122" offset="412472">Amendment 73 is not a qualification, but even if it is a qualification, the State of Arkansas has the authority to add additional qualifications to those listed in Article I, sections 2 and 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.167" offset="484674">Our Founding Fathers envisioned a Congress of citizen legislators who would serve awhile, return and xx with the people, and not stay in office indefinitely, and during the 18th and 19th Centuries, voluntary rotation was a common practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.228" offset="560952">During the 20th Century, we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of long-term, entrenched incumbents.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.817" offset="599300">Entrenched incumbency makes for an electoral system that is less fair, less competitive, and less representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.773" offset="635035">Amendment 73 was adopted in 1992 by the people of Arkansas overwhelmingly, by a 60 percent to 40 percen majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.015" offset="684041">Twenty-two States now have some form of term limit proposals or ballot access initiatives on their books.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.038" offset="724165">Thirty-seven States have term limits that limit the terms of the executive branch officials of those States or the legislative branch officials of those States.</text>

            <text syncTime="171.193" offset="856763">That issue is not before this Court, however, but the people of Arkansas, by Amendment 73, have decided to encourage rotation in office to make the election process more fair and more competitive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1365.434" offset="5633723">I think that the question that several members of the Court have been putting really illuminates the constitutional structure that we're talking about here, and the argument that is being made by the opponents of Amendment 73, first of all skipping over and pretending that it's a legal incapacity when it's nothing of the kind... it's a less restrictive alternative that the State has adopted, but skipping over that and accepting the pretense that this is a limitation on service in the Congress, you're then put to the task of fitting together some provisions of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.094" offset="5796413">What does the Constitution say with respect to the power of Congress to adopt, say, a term limits provision and apply it to the States?</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.418" offset="5845628">I think the answer to that has to begin by looking at the sources of power of Congress and of the States, and they are very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.459" offset="5889827">Congress has power only insofar as it is granted in the Constitution, and the only grant of power to Congress to legislate in this area has to come from Article I, section 4, or, I quickly amend, the Necessary and Proper Clause, which is also part of Article I, section 4, and nowadays section 5 of the Fifteenth Amendment, which has received a very, very broad interpretation, and I don't think that we need to address that at this time, but we recognize that that's very broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.578" offset="6014274">The sources of power of the State are very, very different, and particularly when you have legislation, a constitutional amendment that the people of Arkansas adopted and imposed on themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="1501.072" offset="6176234">My answer would be no, it does not, for the following reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.840" offset="6187310">I would say, in the first instance, if you take the words of Article I, section 4, "make or alter", and say that those are of equal force, and I'm not sure that you have to do that at all, I would say Congress has the power to knock out any State law with respect to elections that Congress doesn't like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.219" offset="6260870">It's very, very clear that that's why Article I, section 4 was put in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.623" offset="6278529">But once you have the law passed, once you have the authority of Congress to do that exercise, that's not the end of the exercise, that's just the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.912" offset="6315623">This Court pointed that out in Williams v. Rhodes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.847" offset="6327326">There may be power there, but then, has the power been properly exercised?</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.834" offset="6347283">First of all, it would obviously be subject to attack under the Fifth... the equal protection aspects of the Fifth Amendment, just like a Fourteenth Amendment case, which is what this really is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.707" offset="6390856">Secondly, you would have to test it under the Tenth Amendment, because this Court recognized in cases like New York v. United States, Gregory and Ashcroft, that there is a certain core of State authority that really is sacrosanct.</text>

            <text syncTime="4089.972" offset="16531904">They seem to rely principally upon the times, places, and manner provision, Article I, section 4, but we have to remember that the power there is one shared coextensively by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4104.982" offset="16591881">Where does that lead the petitioners with respect to their arguments?</text>
            <text syncTime="4109.135" offset="16608495">If it is a qualification, then the States may add, and the Congress may add.</text>
            <text syncTime="4117.122" offset="16640469">If that's what they're relying upon, this creates an interesting situation that I think Justice Scalia and Justice Souter were alluding to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4125.395" offset="16673592">That is, if the States can set qualifications, then presumably, under Article I section 5, Congress can judge those qualifications not against the constitutional, textual qualifications, but the potentially myriad qualifications that States could set up along the lines of the ones that have been provided by Amendment 73.</text>
            <text syncTime="4152.462" offset="16781843">If it is a manner, then the States may bar access to the ballot, but Congress also may bar access to the ballot, and it is not a power in Congress that has to await action by the States.</text>

            <text syncTime="4182.665" offset="16902634">This is not times, places, and manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4184.951" offset="16911829">This is a qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.553" offset="16918203">With due respect to my cocounsel, I think it's unavoidable that this is a qualification.</text>

            <text syncTime="4234.449" offset="17109837">I think Justice O'Connor also asked the question, and I think the answer lies in the fact that Storer v. Brown was focused on one election cycle.</text>
            <text syncTime="4245.988" offset="17155917">That is, the burdens that were imposed upon the would-be candidates in Storer v. Brown were based upon their failure during the election cycle to do the types of things that California law required.</text>
            <text syncTime="4261.932" offset="17219760">Our view is that any burden placed on a candidate for Congress based upon conduct that has not occurred during the election cycle in question is a qualification.</text>
