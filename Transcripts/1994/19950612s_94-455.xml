            <text syncTime="7.664" offset="118278">Mr. Johnson sued five policemen; he said they have wrongly arrested him and beaten him.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.985" offset="143564">Three of the policemen then asked the District Court for a summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.425" offset="161327">They claimed there wasn’t any evidence showing really they had been around.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.184" offset="176374">The District Court said no, and they wanted to appeal; to appeal before the end of the case; an interlocutory appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.627" offset="210124">The Court of Appeals said, “There is no interlocutory appeal; you have to wait till the end of the case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="35.643" offset="230186">And that’s what we had to decide; can they appeal before the end of the case or not? We think they cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.153" offset="260175">Now, they agreed, normally, you can’t appeal from the denial of the summary judgment until the end of the case, but they point out they are special, because they are policemen with the defense of “qualified immunity.”</text>
            <text syncTime="56.035" offset="311793">They’ll get off if the law was not clearly against them; and they say the policy behind that should permit them to take an interlocutory appeal here.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.394" offset="353171">We decide however that the policy does not extend to this kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.647" offset="374173">This is a kind of case where the appeal would be heavily fact-laid.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.041" offset="391727">Where they have an appeal, it is a question primarily and purely of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.007" offset="415655">We explain in our opinion how that distinction fits within the words of the appellate statute and prior case law to deny them an appeal here.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.376" offset="461109">The opinion is unanimous.</text>
