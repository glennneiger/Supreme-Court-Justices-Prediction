            <text syncTime="75.140" offset="449359">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="77.391" offset="458345">The question presented by this case is whether, everything else being equal, a State may provide the same amount of AFDC benefits to a family where the dependent children are all related to their caretaker, but are not siblings of one another, as the State does where the children are all brothers and sisters of one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.747" offset="551759">California and 28 other States have adopted a rule that requires the combination of assistance units when there are more... when there are two or more assistance units residing in the same household with the same caretaker relative.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.218" offset="617692">California also requires the combination of assistance units if there are two caretaker relatives and they are married to each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.632" offset="647367">The full text of California's regulation is set forth at the... in the appendix to the petition for certiorari at note 3 on page 17, note 3 in the district court opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.792" offset="699925">The fundamental error committed by the Ninth Circuit in this case, in the Beaton case, which was the case the district court relied on in ruling in this case and which the Ninth Circuit simply followed in affirming the district court in this case, was to look at the Federal income rules before looking at the question of whether the State has the discretion and the right to require AFD recipients who live together in the same household to be considered one assistance unit for purposes of computing the grant that they receive from the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.874" offset="840255">In essence, the Ninth Circuit put the cart before the horse.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.408" offset="854466">It looked at the income availability rules before looking at the State's discretion to decide that assistance units and groups of AFDC recipients living in the same household may be combined.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.605" offset="911204">The rule that we are proposing that the Court adopt in this case is that under cooperative federalism, which this Court has recognized is the AFDC system that Congress has enacted, the States have the discretion to make this kind of a rule, that assistance units living in the same household be combined, a part of their AFDC program.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.969" offset="992706">To put that another way, we're asking this Court to hold that neither Congress nor the Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services have... by express edict, where that is the only way the State's discretion may be circumscribed in the AFDC programs, have taken that discretion away from the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.271" offset="1057907">I would like to illustrate first how the rule works in... with a practical example, and then I would like to make four points.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.526" offset="1090926">First of all, the points I would like... just briefly going through the points I would like to make this morning, first of all, deciding who must be in an AFDC assistance unit is largely a matter of State discretion, just as the State has a right to decide how poor a person has to be before they receive benefits and how much AFDC benefits the State should pay that person.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.927" offset="1168457">The second point, when assistance units are combined, the income and resources of all the persons in that household who are claiming AFDC are considered as available to every other member of that unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.327" offset="1222061">The availability rules really relate to the situation after the assistance units are combined, and determining whether the individual has income available to that person such that it then, because of the combination of the assistance units and the operation of the Federal statute--</text>

            <text syncTime="723.816" offset="3044049">The... in one household there's a single mother and her three children.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.979" offset="3060663">In that household, under Federal law and under State law, there's only one assistance unit, a four-person assistance unit because the caretaker is also eligible for AFDC, and in California, currently that four-person assistance unit would receive a maximum grant of 723.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.150" offset="3121372">The other household right next door, single mother, one child, takes in two grandchildren.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.804" offset="3151987">Her eldest daughter has died, or is... has abandoned the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.027" offset="3168915">In that household, there are two assistance units.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.568" offset="3183021">Initially, there are two assistance units, one made up of the mother and her child, the other made up of the two grandchildren.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.424" offset="3206531">California's rule simply provides that in that instance where there are two assistance units, one relative caretaker, that the assistance units be combined.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.650" offset="3247386">If the assistance units are combined, that family receives the same maximum aid payment as does the first family, 723 a month, irrespective of whether that's determined to be an adequate amount for purposes of support or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.900" offset="3308408">That's really not the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.961" offset="3312588">The issue is, we have two families that are similarly sized and essentially similarly situated, a single caretaker and three minor children.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.324" offset="3338084">If there are... if the State's rule cannot be enforced and we have to have two assistance units in that family, then the State has to pay out 980 to that second family because there are two two-person assistance units, each of which receive, under current California law, a maximum aid payment of 490.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.077" offset="3413107">Obviously, the reason for the assistance unit rule, the combination-of-assistance unit rule that we have suggested, is that the State sees this as a way of treating families who are similarly sized the same, and it also saves money.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.246" offset="3461799">There's no debate about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.488" offset="3466710">It does save money for the State of California.</text>

I would like to address briefly, because I'd like to reserve some time for rebuttal, the... our rule is different from the family filing unit rule, which is the Federal rule that mandates a nuclear family, the children, the brothers and sisters, parents, step-parents and... not step-parents, excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.303" offset="3570051">I misspoke... the parents and natural children or adopted children of that family be considered together.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.268" offset="3589904">That in a sense, Congress in a sense took the option away from recipients to exclude persons from the assistance units that may have income that would disqualify them or would disqualify the family, or result in less benefits for the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.936" offset="3644552">That rule forces individuals into an assistance unit, and Congress can do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.599" offset="3667226">Congress can say, irrespective of the availability-of-income principle in the regulations, we're going to require that these individuals be together in an assistance unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.535" offset="3702962">California's rule doesn't force anybody to apply for AFDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.389" offset="3718322">California's rule simply says, if you're going to apply for AFDC, and under the circumstances of the rule a single caretaker relative, all those individuals in the household must be considered, their needs and resources must be considered together.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.467" offset="3770671">So we're really not... and what we're really looking at then is whether the Federal regulations in some way have prohibited that, and we submit that they do not, that the regulations only come into play after the assistance unit is formed to determine whether or not the individual is... has income and resources that are available to that individual such that they would be deemed available to the rest of the assistance unit.</text>

            <text syncTime="935.496" offset="3890730">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="949.044" offset="3944960">Our position is that filing rules such as California's are consistent with the regulations governing the AFDC program, and that is the longstanding view of the Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.520" offset="3982890">California's rule simply ensures that single caretaker families with the same number of dependent children and the same financial resources receive the same amount of aid, otherwise, as my cocounsel has observed, there would be a disparity of aid simply between two families, simply because the children in one family happen to be siblings and the children in the other were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.753" offset="4063765">Eliminating that disparity was, in our view, one of a number of permissible ways that California had to allocate its finite AFDC resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.929" offset="4092500">Under this Court's decisions in Dandridge and in Jefferson, the State alternatively could have put a flat ceiling on the family grant regardless of the number of children in the unit, in the family, and it alternatively could have reduced across the board the level of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.727" offset="4147670">California's judgment was that the approach it's taken was the most fair one, and under the Social Security Act, it was California's prerogative to balance those equities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.292" offset="4181943">The... as for the availabilities rule, the availability regulations, those address a different situation entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.920" offset="4216425">They forbid a State from imputing income either to a dependent child or a group of dependent children from an outside source unless that outside source has a legal duty to provide that support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.817" offset="4260102">They do not prevent a State from assuming that children under the care of the same caretaker will share amongst themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="1043.989" offset="4324781">The regulations are printed on pages 30 through 32 of the petition appendix, and I think the dispositive language is as follows: the regulations forbid a State from including... from attributing income to somebody because either they are... attributing income from a person because they are either present in the same household or included in the same family.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.482" offset="4414746">But California has a different basis for grouping children together, and that is that in addition to being included in the same household and present in the same family, those children are also claiming AFDC with the same caretaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.420" offset="4462498">In other words, there's a different triggering criterion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.142" offset="4473365">That's clear, for example, on page... on appendix 30, the regulation there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.914" offset="4492487">They refer to... it refers to support, for the support of the assistance unit, making it implicitly clear that it is support from outside of the group of people claiming aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.223" offset="4533656">I think in this respect the rule simply is drawing... what California has done is simply drawing on a broader premise in the act, which is that family members share.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.567" offset="4567093">That was reflected in this Court's decision in Bowen with regard to child support payments, where the Court noted that the possibility that one child's use of... the use of funds earmarked for one child solely for the selfish benefit of that one child is really more of a theoretical than a practical--</text>

            <text syncTime="1404.437" offset="5766531">Now, of course, if a particular child was anticipating... if a family realized that a child in the unit was going to be receiving a decent amount of money that was not disregarded under the act in subsequent months, such as to reduce the family's old grant, California's rule permits the family not to claim aid for that child in subsequent months, Justice Ginsburg, and so as a result there is flexibility here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.784" offset="5859945">All California is simply saying is, if you do actually elect to claim AFDC with the same caretaker, you should be grouped together much as you would be if you were siblings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.229" offset="5893695">I think in that regard it's very important just to emphasize the limited impact of this rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1447.958" offset="5940611">The State here has simply said, only if you apply must you be included.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.199" offset="5953568">In the second respect, I think the concerns that the respondents have raised about the attribution of outside income are somewhat overblown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.842" offset="5980213">Section 602(a)(8)(A) of the statute provides that the earned income of any child claiming AFDC while still a student is 100-percent disregarded in order to ensure that there is some remaining incentive for that person to continue to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.882" offset="6032353">In all likelihood, that's going to be the overwhelming amount majority of cases where outside income is being brought into the unit by a child in that unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.207" offset="6065581">I'd like to address briefly the court of appeals rationale here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.551" offset="6083030">They equated the caretaker with the man in the house, so-called, from King v. Smith on the grounds that neither might be legally responsible under State law for particular children, such as a niece or a nephew.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.087" offset="6125140">That was wrong for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.539" offset="6130991">First of all, it's the statute, not the filing rule, which puts the caretaker, an extended family member, in the role of caretaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.531" offset="6154919">That's in section 606(a), which defines the caretaker to include aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins.</text>

            <text syncTime="1516.600" offset="6215210">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.515" offset="6238825">The State argues that its consolidation rule is a valid way to save money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.650" offset="6259409">We do not dispute that States may, in their AFDC's plans, take into account economies of scale in an effort to save money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.613" offset="6291279">However, California has quite simply chosen the wrong method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.056" offset="6304967">Although States do have discretion in setting up AFDC, that discretion is limited by congressional action, the regulations of HHS, and the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.493" offset="6342792">One such limit is that in counting income and resources, the States may only count income and resources that are actually available, in determining the grant and payment amount, and to which an individual has a legal entitlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.853" offset="6400157">For the most part, the State follows this principle in formulating assistance units.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.474" offset="6418652">Let me explain a little bit about how the system works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.366" offset="6430250">If I were to take in my orphan nephew, the State would pay to me a full grant of 299 a month, and it does that despite the fact that I have income of my own ineligible for AFDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.655" offset="6487406">The State does that because one of the goals of the statute is to encourage the care of children in the homes of their relatives, and also because I have no legal obligation to support that child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.823" offset="6528053">Similarly, as the State admits, if two adult sisters live together, both of whom were poor, both of whom had children and required AFDC, the State again would pay two full grants and would set up two separate assistance units, and similarly, they do this because there is no legal duty to support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.633" offset="6603285">But when it comes to the poorest people and the neediest people, the State stops following this general rule and forces consolidation and doesn't pay a full grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.253" offset="6649783">Sweeping the whole family into the assistance unit is important, as counsel has noted, because once in, all of the income and resources count.</text>

            <text syncTime="2835.458" offset="11490586">First, when they combine the units, it violates the regulations at issue because in so doing it consolidates the unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.823" offset="11532069">It reduces the grant based on the fact that this individual lives with the other folks, despite that there's no legal obligation of support between those individuals, and perhaps the best example is from our named plaintiffs, the Edwards household.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.294" offset="11593927">The Edwards household, when the child first came in they mistakenly under their rule paid, but correctly under our interpretation, two different units, two different grants, and had two assistance units, so the Edwards grant, when they consolidated, went for the household from 901 a month to 630 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.008" offset="11668846">The child, the needy niece who came into the new household, her grant went from 341 a month to 210 a month, so what they're doing in that situation is actually reducing the amount of assistance payment paid to the household and to the individual child based on the presence of the family members and the household together, even though there's no legal duty to support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.381" offset="11758289">Secondly, in violation of the substitute parent regulation, which says that you can only presume and make this automatic assumption that the income of a parent is going to be available, they assume that all people in the household will contribute to one another, and here the example that was asked... I think it was Justice Ginsburg asked about, if you were... if the Solicitor General were... allowed the family to remove themselves from a lump sum income, they couldn't do that if outside income came into the home, and that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.412" offset="11882423">So in that situation, when somebody gets, for instance, Social Security death benefits, which are probably the largest single source of outside income in the AFDC program, if an individual such as the child of the caretaker relative were to receive those death benefits, then not only would that... would the... would they be attributable to the parent, the mother, and to the child, but they're also attributable to the nephew, and that point there's nothing--</text>

            <text syncTime="3019.929" offset="12228493">But that's incor... that's correct in the future, the nephew might be able to opt out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.114" offset="12257228">But in our situation, for instance, we have groups of multiple nephews, so for instance, you have two sets of cousins, two cousins each, okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.161" offset="12293486">If this set of cousins has no income but this set of cousins over here, one of the two gets outside income, that one cousin cannot opt out, because that cousin is brought in because of his sibling being in there, and so they're all combined, so they would have to stay in the assistance unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.832" offset="12356075">The only way you could not count that income is if both of those cousins opted out, and the problem with that is that these children are needy, and need AFDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.835" offset="12392124">It's slightly disingenuous, I think, for the State to suggest that these needy orphans or nephews need not apply, or aren't mandated to apply for AFDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.953" offset="12424621">They really have no choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.572" offset="12431099">I mean, they're in need.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.924" offset="12436533">They're the poorest of the poor, and so it's not true that you could opt out in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.466" offset="12454609">And similarly, as I said, it's news to me today that with the lump sum income rule, it's a similar kind of thing if the individual got a lottery ticket, as you suggested, although the largest kind of lump sum is typically Social Security death benefits awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.099" offset="12529215">If the individual got Social Security death benefit awards, and that death benefit came to the child of the parent again, the nephew could not opt out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.134" offset="12569339">I mean, that's what the rule says now, and I'm surprised by what the SG is saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.909" offset="12588461">I think what the Solicitor General maybe was suggesting is that if it only came to the nephew, then the nephew could opt out, but since the parent and the child have to be in the assistance unit, they're not going to be able to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3121.727" offset="12635690">Well, I guess we don't really have the opt-out situation and the lump-sum question before us here.</text>

            <label>Ms. Katherine Meiss</label>
            <text syncTime="3127.931" offset="12660559">Well, as a matter of fact, the class definition says that any individual... it's true none of our named plaintiffs received a lump-sum income, or outside income, but the class definition is, any individual affected by this policy, and at the time this was submitted to the district court we had a joint stipulation of undisputed facts, and one of those facts was that outside income would be treated in the same way, so I do believe the matter was before the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.886" offset="12760346">To summarize, one of the basic principles in the AFDC program is that only income that is actually available to somebody or that they have a legal entitlement to can be counted in determining the grant and assistance payment amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.551" offset="12846968">Congress has recognized this principle, and has created certain exceptions to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.982" offset="12864732">For instance, the mandatory filing unit rule, which we talked about earlier, 42 U.S.C. (a)(38) is one of those exceptions in which it said nuclear family members must be on aid together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.120" offset="12905274">Similarly, the proration plan pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 612, which says that you can assume economies of scale and which we say is the method which should be used in this case, since you have a shared living situation with more than one assistance unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.309" offset="12954070">That's an exception to the availability regulation, and there are other similar ones, such as Congress has now allowed the deeming of step-parent income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.743" offset="12983746">But Congress has not created an exception in this case, and as the State admits, it starts with two assistance units and then it combines those assistance units.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.629" offset="13015302">That combination of assistance units is contrary to the plain language of the regulations, and it's contrary to the contemporaneous construction given those regulations by their drafters when they were adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.015" offset="13060859">HHS's interpretation there also ignores the plain language and the contemporaneous construction and was not adopted pursuant to the APA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.573" offset="13099102">Therefore, no deference is owed to that interpretation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dennis Paul Eckhart</label>
            <text syncTime="3244.866" offset="13128255">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.868" offset="13140271">I would like to make a couple of points in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.861" offset="13152288">First of all, the... on the last point regarding the combination of assistance units being a... somehow the boogie man in this case, the combination of assistance units as... the State's right to combine assistance units in this instance has always been the interpretation of the Department of Health &amp; Human Services and its predecessor, the Department of Health, Education &amp; Welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.127" offset="13249254">That's always been its interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.456" offset="13254583">It's true that the Department or the Secretary only addressed the question of the availability regulations in the most recent action transmittal, the one that's reproduced in the appendix to the petition for certiorari that was issued in 1994.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.028" offset="13316859">It's true that the Secretary only addressed the availability regulations at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.520" offset="13330861">However, the Secretary is presumed to know what its... what his or her regulations are, and the earlier interpretations, which were interpretations... not changes in the rules, but interpretations, which do not need to be adopted pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act, were... are consistent, that the State has the right to combine assistance units in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.682" offset="13411527">And I believe that there... although the current California rule says that only an assistance unit where there's a single caretaker relative and children who are not siblings of one another, or two caretakers of separate assistance units who are married to each other or have a child in common, if those are the only situations the State has currently addressed, that does not mean that the State could not address the further situation which was discussed at some length by respondents' counsel, that if there were two sisters living in the same house, each with their own children, again we're talking about individuals either one of whom could be the caretaker for her sister's children, for her nieces, for her nephews.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.476" offset="13554678">In that instance, I believe it's perfectly consistent with the understanding of who a caretaker can be, that the State can combine those assistance units in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.234" offset="13593757">Secondly, I think the... in the arguments about the--</text>

            <text syncTime="3396.229" offset="13733669">That would prevent... the availability rules would prevent the State from imputing the income of that person, that person who is not in the assistance unit who just happens to be living in the house.</text>
