            <text syncTime="11.539" offset="191991">Mr. Pendley.</text>

            <text syncTime="12.724" offset="196798">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.426" offset="207560">Adarand is a small, family-owned corporation that does business in Colorado Springs, Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.212" offset="226682">It is owned by and operated by Randy Pech, his wife Valerie, his mom Ruth, and their friend and Partner, Steve Gaglan.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.317" offset="255103">In the year surrounding the events that led to this action, Adarand's annual average gross receipts were approximately $900,000, but their average annual net profits was but $30,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.125" offset="302332">In fact, in the year before this event, they had a net negative cash flow of some $20,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.862" offset="325320">Adarand specializes in the construction of highway guardrails, primarily as a result of the receipt of subcontracts from prime contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.383" offset="355413">In 1989, Adarand submitted a bid to do the guardrail work on the subcontract as a subcontractor along 4.7 miles of highway in the San Juan National Forest in extreme Southwestern Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.840" offset="405255">Although it submitted the lowest bid, and although it has an excellent reputation for doing quality work on a timely basis its bid was rejected by operation of the statute questioned here, a statute which presumes that all members of certain enumerated racial and ethnic groups are socially and economically disadvantaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.285" offset="470979">Adarand challenged the constitutionality of the statute both on its face and as applied to him in the loss of this $20,000 contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="92.193" offset="514655">When we look at the statement by Mountain Sand and Gravel at page 30 and 31 of the joint appendix, Mountain Sand and Gravel says, but for the SCC, the subcontractor compensation clause, Adarand would have received the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="115.925" offset="609532">That is clear by other means, Justice Souter.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.177" offset="622593">There are several means: 1) Adarand, Randy Pech testified that in fact it was the operation of the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.481" offset="647775">He said, Gonzales is a DBE because he is a minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.616" offset="664285">In addition, we have the testimony that's contained in the appendix in the reply, at pages 7, 9 and 10, and 14, where three Government officials testified they knew of no circumstance under which anybody had been a DBE for any other reason than the operation of the presumption.</text>

            <text syncTime="155.083" offset="766162">As page 31 of the appendix in our petition for writ of cert makes clear, both parties on cross-motions for summary judgment stipulated to all the facts, or agreed there were no genuine issues of material fact remaining in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.093" offset="822273">One of those issues would have been the subcontracting compensation clause's operation.</text>

            <text syncTime="200.212" offset="946721">In addition, that... there is section 637(d), which is on page 11 of the Government's appendix, which sets out the presumption, and that presumption is applied to 644(g) because of the appropriation in the STURAA, what's called the STURAA, the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act, which is at page 16-A of the Government's brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="310.868" offset="1389340">And one of the reasons why that's very important, Justice O'Connor, is because section 108, the subcontracting compensation clause, requires the prime contractor to provide to the Federal Government a copy of the DBE certification, so the Federal officials involved in this program have known from the very beginning the basis upon which the certification took place, which adds increased importance to their testimony that they knew of no situation in which DBE's were certified by any other way than the presumption.</text>

            <text syncTime="1492.685" offset="6116562">The subcontracting compensation clause challenged here is a means of effectuating a national policy designed by Congress and supported by Presidents of both parties to ensure to the greatest extent possible that Federal procurement programs do not compound the continuing effects of well-documented discrimination but, rather, serve to offset their consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.765" offset="6208931">The process by which compensation is awarded is neither overinclusive, since members of certain designated racial and ethnic groups were not, in fact, disadvantaged or ineligible under the program, nor underinclusive, since some individuals who are not members of those designated groups may qualify as socially and disadvantaged persons under the regulatory scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="1626.688" offset="6652595">One has to understand that the Small Business Act, for example, was in existence for 25 years before Congress decided to focus, as it has in recent years, on the problems of members of certain racial and ethnic groups that were socially and economically disadvantaged, so there was some experience on the part of Congress with the way in which Federal procurement dollars were somehow not finding their way to people who were the victims of discrimination.</text>
