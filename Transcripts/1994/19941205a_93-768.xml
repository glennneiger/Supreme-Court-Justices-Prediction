            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="142511">We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 93-768, the Milwaukee Brewery Workers' Pension Plan v. Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.684" offset="185247">Mr. Bruton.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_g_bruton" startTime="11.809" stopTime="173.071">
            <label>Mr. Michael G. Bruton</label>
            <text syncTime="11.809" offset="189740">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="15.401" offset="204055">In 1981, the Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company closed its Milwaukee plant and completely withdrew from the Milwaukee Brewery Workers' Pension Plan, a defined benefit, multiemployer plan in which Schlitz' employees had participated since the plan's inception in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.065" offset="282736">In the late 1970's and early 1980's, the brewing industry in Milwaukee was considered a declining industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.406" offset="316069">The number of hours that plan participants were currently working were diminishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.356" offset="335922">At the same time, the average age of plan participants, as well as their length of service, was increasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.588" offset="364761">As a result, this plan, like many other multiemployer plans at that time, experienced significant underfunding problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.239" offset="403422">As of December 31st, 1980, which was the last day for this plan in the year prior to the year in which Schlitz withdrew, this plan had unfunded but vested liabilities in excess of 111 million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.607" offset="480849">That amount represented the difference, as of that day, between the fair cash market value of the plan's assets, approximately 51 million dollars, and the present cash value of the plan's liability to pay for vested benefits at some future date, as of that date, approximately 162 million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.518" offset="584503">It's significant to note that in 1980, in reducing the future liabilities for present cash... for the vested benefits to present cash value, this plan used a discount rate of 7 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.981" offset="646361">After carefully studying the problems that multiemployer plans faced in the area of underfunding, and the application of ERISA to the multiemployer plans, Congress passed the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, or MPPAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.724" offset="717309">Perhaps the most significant portion of MPPAA is the requirement that a withdrawing employer continue to make payments to a multiemployer plan in an effort to fully fund a portion of the unfunded vested liabilities which are attributed to that employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.247" offset="803409">Simply stated, the question in this case is, how much was Schlitz required to pay to this plan?</text>

            <text syncTime="173.071" offset="834756">Well, isn't the question even more simply stated as the question of how much interest?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael G. Bruton</label>
            <text syncTime="177.913" offset="854087">I think the question, Your Honor, is, in total how much was Schlitz required to pay?</text>
            <text syncTime="184.660" offset="881149">The important component of the amount that Schlitz was required to pay is the interest on the unfunded but vested benefits that were allocated to it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael G. Bruton</label>
            <text syncTime="198.201" offset="935275">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.888" offset="937992">It's important... the answer to the question lies in the proper application of section 4219(c)(1)(a) of MPPAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.588" offset="976862">That provision can be found at page 4 of the blue brief of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.305" offset="995670">In that section, Congress very carefully and with great detail instructed that a presumed or hypothetical payment schedule should be created in order to determine the number of level annual payments that a withdrawing employer should be required to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.829" offset="1073724">In this case, of the 111 million dollars in unfunded liabilities as of December 31st, 1980, Schlitz was allocated 23.3 million dollars, but Schlitz has not paid 23.3 million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.494" offset="1144464">Despite never missing a payment and never being late with a payment, Schlitz has paid 28... approximately 28.5 million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.833" offset="1185842">The plan submits that when section 4219(c)(1)(a) is properly applied, that the plan... that Schlitz should have paid approximately 31.1 million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.061" offset="1234743">That 2.6 million dollar difference depends on how the first payment in this presumed schedule, which must be established under 4219, is treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.180" offset="1291167">The plan submits that when properly constructed, the payment schedule is contained in the blue brief of petitioners at page 28 and 29.</text>

            <text syncTime="300.630" offset="1344980">Assume a case in which the annual payment that it has to make is 100 percent of the unfunded liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.424" offset="1376118">One payment would do it, and the payment would be due in August of the year, and it's made in August of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.734" offset="1401404">They paid up to that time by the regular payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.389" offset="1412062">Would you say they also had to pay a year's interest on that?</text>

            <text syncTime="616.736" offset="2609411">In other words, Congress considered the contributions for that year, the actual contributions that were being made, as a wash, and for purposes of making the calculation easy to determine, and to prevent plans from incurring enormous actuarial expenses each time a withdrawing employer decided to withdraw, a simple method of just designating the end of the plan year prior to withdrawal was adopted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2606.014" offset="10566518">It's clear under the statute that the liability arises, and the amount of the liability, when it arises, is the principal amount, not the principal amount plus a year of interest, and so we don't think there's room here for the Court to find the imposition of interest, and the legislative history makes it clear it is a deliberate choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2635.189" offset="10683233">The first markup of the bill provided that the presumed payments... the payments were presumed to be made as if they occurred at the end of the year in which made, and that allowed for the payment of 1 year of interest in the first year's payments of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.076" offset="10734746">Then, for some unexplained reason, by the time it was passed on the floor, that was changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.432" offset="10752196">The presumed payment occurred at the beginning of the year in which the payments were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.040" offset="10774661">So the statute, while it was originally backloaded, turned into a frontloaded statute between the first markup and the time the bill passed on the floor of the House.</text>

            <text syncTime="2687.809" offset="10893675">So while Congress didn't say, this is why we made the change, we know they were making changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.057" offset="10910707">They said they were making a number of changes in order to reduce the amount of liability imposed on employers, and they took a statute where the interest was backloaded and turned it into one that was frontloaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.647" offset="10949055">So while there are a number of other aspects of the legislative history that we think support our reading of this statute, we think it's clear that as to this one feature, the accrual of interest, it is that interest would not accrue until the point that the amortization schedule began.</text>

            <text syncTime="2853.619" offset="11556976">Actuarial projections generally are imprecise and are normally supposed to be conservative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.477" offset="11580382">That is, actuaries are supposed to overestimate the liabilities, not underestimate them, and here, for example, as pointed out at page 174 of the Joint Appendix, this plan was earning in the year of the valuation over 15 percent of its investments, and yet they assumed they would only be able to earn 7 percent as the actuarial rate of return.</text>

            <text syncTime="2918.485" offset="11816424">Actuaries are supposed to and, generally, try to be conservative to provide a cushion there, so there is a cushion that's provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.669" offset="11845159">Also, the annual payment formula here is skewed to require employers in a declining industry like this to pay more money after they withdraw than they did before, so that the annual contribution from Schlitz actually went up after it withdrew and no longer had employees participating in the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.615" offset="11916944">And then finally, the plan is revalued every year, and the assumptions are adjusted, so if in fact the plan is having a streak of bad luck, the actuarial assumptions are adjusted, the funding levels are changed, and the remaining employers make up the difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="3303.443" offset="13356186">As I recall in Huber, Justice Ginsburg, the withdrawal occurred at the outset of the plan year, and so it was a little hard to tell whether the court in Huber meant that interest should accrue from the date of withdrawal or from the end of the prior plan year, since they were so close together in time, and in fact one later district court case which we cite, which was affirmed by the Third Circuit without opinion, seemed to have thought that it was accruing from the withdrawal date and not from the end of the prior plan year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.947" offset="13466214">I have to agree those opinions are somewhat murky, and so I can understand why Judge Easterbrook may have been confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.414" offset="13496098">Also, I would point out that in none of these cases up till now has interest really been the principal issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.459" offset="13520340">Even in the court of appeals here, other issues predominated, and so it may be that other courts have not had an opportunity to consider this interest rate accrual issue in quite as much detail as we have in briefing it for the Court today, or the Court has in studying it.</text>
