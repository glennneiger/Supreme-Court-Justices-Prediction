            <text syncTime="11.219" offset="197807">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.434" offset="222676">The issue in Robert O'Neal's case is that once a habeas corpus petitioner has proven a constitutional violation, does the State then have the burden to prove the constitutional violation harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under Kotteakos?</text>
            <text syncTime="32.012" offset="280981">It used to be beyond a reasonable doubt under Chapman.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.794" offset="292057">This Court adopted the Kotteakos standard, which reduced the burden that the State must maintain, and with the reduction of the burden also came the allocation of the burden, so yes, the State must maintain the burden of proving the error harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.571" offset="343257">With Kotteakos came the Kotteakos case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.714" offset="355796">As in Justice Stevens' case, Justice Stevens' concurrence indicated that placed the burden of proving harmless error on the State for constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.209" offset="389755">This was consistent with all the Court's precedent in this area of harmless error determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.503" offset="414937">Under Chapman, the burden was placed upon the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, and now the Court has placed the burden upon the State to prove the error harmless, with no substantial and injurious effect upon the verdict.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas R. Wetterer, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="87.088" offset="501245">And that was the issue that this Court resolved in the Brecht case, and didn't make a different result by reducing the burden on the State to accommodate the interest of the State in finality, comity, and federalism.</text>

            <text syncTime="97.554" offset="543146">Well, why shouldn't it also accommodate those interests by saying that the burden is on the petitioner rather than on the State as to, when the thing is equally divided, I guess?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_r_wetterer_jr" startTime="108.462" stopTime="141.982">
            <label>Mr. Thomas R. Wetterer, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="108.462" offset="586823">Because the writ would no longer be able to serve the purposes that this Court has placed upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.046" offset="609079">In order to protect the factually innocent and ensure the accurate determination of guilt and innocence in the trial process, and to protect the constitutional rights, the burden must remain with the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.904" offset="664563">In those cases in which there is an equal inference on whether or not the petitioner has met his claim or not, traditionally the State has borne that risk of error and the risk that the constitutional right was not violated.</text>

            <text syncTime="141.982" offset="720883">Do you think a lot of cases will be affected by how we decide this question?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas R. Wetterer, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="147.348" offset="742303">Under the current case law it indicates that not as many as would under other cases that this Court has decided in habeas corpus, because under habeas corpus law, under Fretwell, the Court is supposed to first determine whether a constitutional violation has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.667" offset="807610">If this Court were to place the burden upon the petitioner, then this case would affect every case, every habeas corpus case in the United States, because then the Court would then have to determine prejudice as part of the determination on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.956" offset="856720">If this Court remains the burden on the State to prove harmless error once the petitioner has proven a constitutional violation, then this will affect a few cases, because under the Chapman standard it was estimated that only 1 in 1,000 cases warranted any review under the Chapman standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.947" offset="924743">It's assumed that not that many petitioners will make the... will find relief under the lower standard of Kotteakos, and therefore it depends upon the decision of this Court whether this impact has a... has an impact in every Federal case that ever comes before any court or magistrate, or whether this decision only applies in those situations that once the Court has found that there has been a violation of the constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.123" offset="1021396">If there's been a violation of constitutional rights proven by the petitioner, that has met the interest that this Court has set for a meeting of comity, finality, and federalism under McCleskey.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.412" offset="1078552">At that point, the State has no interest in a constitutionally defective judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.696" offset="1095688">Under the Kotteakos standard, this Court has said that when there is grave doubt as to the impact of the error, then relief is to be granted, and that is those cases in which the State has been unable to demonstrate that the error did not affect the rights of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.995" offset="1160890">In a lot of cases, it will be very clear for the Court that the error did or did not affect, but in those few cases, in those cases in which the courts have reviewed the record, found a constitutional violation, and then have been unable to really determine whether there has been a violation but they have grave doubt, and those cases clearly were granted relief under Chapman and should still remain to be granted relief under Kotteakos and Brecht.</text>

            <text syncTime="1087.114" offset="4501428">To reframe, the single issue on which the Court granted certiorari in this case is whether the habeas petitioner or the habeas respondent bears the burden of showing that any error identified at trial was of such magnitude that it actually had a substantial and injurious effect in determining the jury's verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.204" offset="4569765">It is our position that the habeas petitioner properly bears this burden, as stated in Brecht, for two reasons: First, this is consistent with the nature of habeas proceedings as civil actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.921" offset="4608635">Second, this is consistent with the longstanding tenor of this Court's habeas jurisprudence, which recognizes that a collateral challenge to a separate and distinct State court judgment requires the party initiating the collateral challenge to make all the showings necessary to justify setting aside that State court judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.182" offset="4677703">And Justice O'Connor, I think you are correct to note that a habeas action, this Court has long held, is a civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.579" offset="4707273">That means that the petitioner, who, in essence, is the plaintiff in the case, must make all the showings necessary to justify relief, and this is, in essence, an element of the claim necessary to show a custody in violation of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.858" offset="4764325">There must be a causal link, as the Solicitor General submitted in the brief for the United States, between the error and the verdict to justify relief here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1302.446" offset="5362738">--Because I think that with Chapman the Court carried in a criminal law formulation, and I think that the Court's application of Kotteakos both before and since, Palmer v. Hoffman, McDonough Power, is that in a civil proceeding the party seeking to set aside the judgment must bear the burden of showing that the error actually affected the result in the case such as to influence its substantial rights, and that's the appropriate formulation, we believe, in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.831" offset="5464302">In particular, Justice Ginsburg, to return to the question you asked of the petitioner, we do not understand that the analysis here on this issue would be an affirmative defense that the State must raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.539" offset="5511113">That would not be consistent with the Court's habeas jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.599" offset="5519368">Instead, what would be consistent is to treat it as the Court has treated procedural default in McCleskey, in Coleman, exhaustion in Granberry v. Greer, as a matter that the State must raise, or it may waive it, but once raised, the burden is on the petitioner to make the showings necessary to justify relief, and we think that that's what's consistent with the Court habeas jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.584" offset="5599303">And we think that that's true because the fundamental nature of these proceedings again is they are collateral challenges to separate and distinct State court judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.669" offset="5631590">This Court has held in all such collateral proceedings such as in Park v. Raley, two terms ago, that the burden is on the parties seeking to challenge that judgment, which is now presumed to be final, and the presumption of finality has attached when it's been upheld on direct appeal, to make the showings necessary to justify setting aside that judgment, and it is also consistent with this Court's touchstone principles of its habeas jurisprudence, which stress that there are interests that the State and its citizens share here that are felt in very human terms by the State and its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.441" offset="5762725">This goes directly, if we have endless relitigation in these issues, to the return effect of the criminal laws which is felt in all of our communities and neighborhoods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.684" offset="5791668">It goes directly to public confidence in the judicial system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.297" offset="5806088">It erodes that confidence which is necessary if we're going to secure the voluntary cooperation of citizens who are victims of crime, witnesses to events.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.014" offset="5837017">As this Court said in Engle v. Isaac, quoting an article, famous article by the late Professor Bator on habeas and finality, it also goes to the rehabilitation of the offender, because one who doesn't yet recognize that they stand fully and finally convicted is not prepared to undertake rehabilitation, and these are very important interests that the State and its citizens feel, I would stress, in very human terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.726" offset="5923848">And the presumption of finality, if it means anything, means that when a petitioner has not succeeded in showing that error identified at trial actually had an effect on the jury's verdict, a substantial injurious effect, it is not appropriate to presume, then, that the State court judgment should be set aside.</text>

            <text syncTime="2110.173" offset="8593667">I think it's very clear from the Sixth Circuit's decision that first of all they found that there was no error in the jury instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.466" offset="8614774">It was a proper... perhaps not ideal, but a proper statement of Ohio law and complicity and conspiracy that intent to kill can be presumed from circumstances, including a common design to enter into a crime that is reasonably likely to cause the death of the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.715" offset="8667750">However, more than that, the Court only assumed arguendo that there was error, perhaps, in a combination of jury instruction with prosecutorial comment, and so if the Court were to disagree with us as to the allocation of burden of proof, we think both sides would agree that remand would be appropriate first for the Sixth Circuit to actually determine if there was error, and second, whether, under a different allocation of burden of proof, that the verdict should be upheld nonetheless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.199" offset="8757716">But again, we think that it is very clear that in a collateral challenge, a civil action habeas proceeding, the burden should be allocated here to the habeas petitioner to make the showing necessary to justify relief, to show that the presumption of finality should be set aside, and that that's consistent with the Court's view of habeas proceedings as only correcting extreme malfunctions in the State court process that have grievously wronged an offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.395" offset="8854473">If the habeas petitioner is unable to show that error actually had effect on the jury's verdict, actually had a substantial injurious effect, we would submit that the State court system has not extremely malfunctioned, it has not grievously wronged the habeas petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="2243.589" offset="9127296">Our position is that the habeas petitioner should bear the burden of proof as to harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.252" offset="9145895">That's not based on an analysis of section 2111, the harmless error statute, or the Federal Rules of Civil or Criminal Procedure, because in our view those rules were primarily designed to deal with errors that occur in a Federal proceeding from the time the proceeding was started until the time the court is asked to assess the effect of some error that's occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.136" offset="9221441">Instead, it's based on the fact... this case does not involve that kind of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.849" offset="9244325">The error that occurred here occurred in a State court proceeding that was finished and came to final judgment before the Federal proceeding was instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.483" offset="9274836">In those circumstances, in our view the crucial point is that there has been a final judgment in the prior proceeding, and that that is what is being attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.580" offset="9307228">The habeas petitioner bears the burden of proving that an error was committed in that proceeding, and for essentially the same reasons, we think the habeas petitioner bears the burden also of showing that that error was not harmless, that it had some effect on the outcome.</text>

            <text syncTime="2322.000" offset="9440974">I can't give you an empirical survey, or empirical results, but if you look through F. 2d, and look through appellate decisions, there are dozens of appellate decisions that have addressed harmless error after having found error on habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.518" offset="9482979">Most of them don't even mention the concept of burden of proof, and at least my sense of looking at them is that it's not ordinarily the decisive question, so I don't think it would affect a very large number of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.636" offset="9535433">On the other hand, in cases where it will affect things, it can have... it can be a very extremely important issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.530" offset="9559048">In this case, for instance, the petitioner was originally tried 14 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.253" offset="9573990">The possibilities of retrying him at this time, it would be very difficult, and the confidence in the outcome of that proceeding that would result in a just conviction if he turned out to be... if he was guilty would be severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.712" offset="9627802">It's for those reasons that the habeas corpus statute specifically speaks in terms of the... what the petitioner must show is that he's in custody in violation of the Constitution, not that he's in custody pursuant to a judgment rendered at a trial at which a constitutional error occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.721" offset="9691854">In our view, because he must be shown to be in custody in violation of the Constitution, that imports a notion of causation which is essentially what--</text>

            <text syncTime="2410.878" offset="9796449">His custody isn't a violation of the Constitution unless there was an error that occurred and that error had some relationship to his custody.</text>

            <text syncTime="2477.624" offset="10063420">I think also the Court's repeatedly said habeas is not supposed to serve the function of a direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.458" offset="10086721">And I would finally point out that Rule 52(a) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure has been interpreted by this Court to put the burden of proof on the Government of showing harmless error once there's been an error that's been shown by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.198" offset="10141683">So I think that's squarely governed by those rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="2513.408" offset="10206571">But on habeas, where the court is not able positively to state that the error did have such a substantial injurious effect on the verdict, I think that the petitioner hasn't made out his claim and that the habeas petition should be denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="2545.197" offset="10333735">A court can reasonably act by assuming that an error has occurred and asking itself whether it's harmless, or they can find out whether the error occurred and then conduct a harmless error review.</text>

            <text syncTime="2732.471" offset="11082823">Nor was it addressing the burden of proof issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.172" offset="11093585">Indeed, as to that point, the experience of the lower Federal courts, Chapman and Kotteakos were equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.558" offset="11119185">The lower Federal courts had had very substantial experience at that time in dealing with both standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.791" offset="11136112">It was a necessary condition, perhaps, for the Court to adopt the Kotteakos standard, that this Court would have had confidence that what it was adopting would be understood by the lower Federal courts, but I don't think it was a sufficient condition, and I certainly wouldn't read into that any statement about the allocation of the burden of proof on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.211" offset="11201732">It was just that this standard, substantial and injurious effect on the verdict, was something that the lower Federal courts would be able to understand what it means, because there's been a lot of case law developed about that in a number of circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2784.556" offset="11291175">There was a constitutional violation found by the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.848" offset="11308312">The court... the Sixth Circuit traditionally, when it's reviewing the record and determines there's no constitutional violations, gives short shrift and says, there's no constitutional violation here, and then dismisses the case in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.396" offset="11354496">The court of appeals in this particular case in the last two pages of the opinion found that some of the errors the petitioner raised did not raise to a constitutional level, and therefore they indicated they weren't going to even analyze them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.874" offset="11404442">Under the Boyde standard adopted by this Court for determination of a jury instruction, the court does not look only at the jury instruction, but has to look at how the jury instruction is used by the court, by the parties in this particular case, and Boyde, even though in this case the jury instruction alone was not a violation, it became a constitutional violation when it was used by the court in this manner, and in response to the prosecutor's comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.742" offset="11511858">In the record below, there will be a demonstration that there was three instances in the closing argument of the prosecutor in which he made references to transferred intent arguments to the jury, and that the court, in its original charge, made at least six references to the ability to transfer intent, and at least three references in a supplemental charge which was given after the jury was given... asked a question about reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.237" offset="11605899">In Mr. O'Neal's case, the prosecution made a very gruesome argument to the jury, and asked them to go back in the room, put the clothes on, walk around and think about what it would be like to hit at someone in the head with a crowbar, and that they should find these parties guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.808" offset="11668174">If the jury really believed at that point the best evidence of guilt, Toney's, then there would have been no reason to come back and ask for any further instructions, because under the State's theory, the best theory the State had was that Mr. O'Neal killed Mr. Podborny with the help of his assistant, and that Mrs. Podborny had paid for that to be done, and that there were other people that verified Mrs. O'Neal's... Mrs. Podborny's story, but there was no one to tie... O'Neal's issue was very substantially in doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.317" offset="11790219">But the jury came back, and they asked for more instructions, and at that point they got this defective jury instruction again which basically, if the jury found that Mr. O'Neal was factually innocent, they had to find him guilty based on the intent of others that had been convicted in an earlier proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.909" offset="11848524">This case, if the burden is placed upon the State, would not affect that many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.692" offset="11871721">It would only affect the cases in an equipoise, and those are the cases that this Court has traditionally said are entitled to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.014" offset="11897007">The person that has been deprived of his liberty has that liberty taken away in a trial, and we're saying that as a result of that constitutional violation that has occurred, and that there's grave doubts as to whether or not he should be in prison at all, or he should have obtained a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.775" offset="11960014">In the administration of criminal justice, the society has always borne that risk, and in these cases, society should still remain to bear that risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.431" offset="11994705">When we're dealing with the administration of justice, sometimes justice should go before the easy administration of justice, and in this case, it goes hand-in-hand, because if the Court were to place the burden upon this petitioner and other petitioners, it would extremely complicate the process and would make it a burden upon the district courts at all levels to determine what constitutes the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.796" offset="12088119">Every individual should know what constitutes a constitutional violation, whether on direct review or collateral review.</text>
