            <text syncTime="54.887" offset="361566">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="60.692" offset="384763">The issue in this case is whether a public official who sued under section 1983 and whose response is that he did nothing wrong has asserted a defense of qualified immunity that may be raised on interlocutory appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.029" offset="426141">In answering that question, I think it's useful to divide it into three component parts and to consider them separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.322" offset="447248">First, whether an official who says that he did not violate clearly established law because he didn't violate the law at all has asserted a defense of qualified immunity, second, whether the validity of that defense is somehow called into question by the existence of a predicate factual dispute about what the defendant did, and third, whether an immunity defense of this kind satisfies the Cohen test for interlocutory appeals, and I'll consider those three points in turn.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="100.439" offset="543692">What was the second point again?</text>
            <text syncTime="101.540" offset="548185">You went too fast for me.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="102.329" offset="551320">I'm sorry, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.190" offset="554768">The second issue, which I think is an integral component of the first, is whether the existence of a predicate factual dispute about what it is that the defendant did somehow calls into question the validity of what otherwise would be a valid qualified immunity defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.371" offset="619447">On the first point, whether or not there is an immunity defense at all, the court of appeals was of the view that immunity comes into play only to protect public officials who acted in the face of legal uncertainty, and therefore, under the court's approach, a public official who says that he didn't violate clearly established law because the law was in a state of flux or uncertainty when he acted, does state an immunity claim and may take an interlocutory appeal if that defense is denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.446" offset="719757">But under this approach, the public official who says that he did not violate clearly established law because there is no evidence that he violated the law at all does not raise an immunity claim and cannot take an interlocutory appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.135" offset="762493">Now, we think that that approach is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the immunity doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.298" offset="783182">Immunity is not designed solely to protect public officials who face legal uncertainty when they act.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.260" offset="803035">Instead, the Court has repeatedly defined qualified immunity to protect all official defendants who did not violate clearly established law.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.926" offset="837726">That is a group that necessarily includes defendants who did not violate the law at all either because they didn't commit the acts alleged or because the acts alleged were clearly constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.773" offset="869073">That point follows directly, I think, from the purposes of the immunity doctrine as repeatedly stated by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.155" offset="894569">The Court has said time and again in cases like Harlow--</text>

            <text syncTime="192.609" offset="912436">How can you possibly apply a doctrine like that, you're immune if you're innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.533" offset="928110">You don't know whether you're innocent until you've been... until the facts have been displayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.915" offset="949635">I mean, it seems to me an immunity doctrine divorced from reference to some principle of law seems to me meaningless.</text>

            <text syncTime="421.238" offset="1826931">In addressing that claim, the court has to xx make some assumption about what the defendant did and then apply the clearly established law to that state of facts, so looking first at whether the law was clearly established or not, clearly we cannot lose the immunity claim, because the law was clear that what we did was constitutional, so the fact that the claim here is that the defendant ultimately didn't violate the law at all shouldn't detract from the immunity claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.484" offset="1927868">The second step of the inquiry is then, all right, let's look at what the defendant did and decide whether that violated clearly established law.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.518" offset="1952005">Now, there typically are disputes about what defendants have done, in cases in which immunity is claimed, and in that situation the court has to make some assumption about what the defendant did.</text>

            <text syncTime="720.404" offset="3023548">And that I think is because there are substantial institutional constraints that prevent public officials in this situation from taking insubstantial appeals, because they are faced with additional section 1983 attorney's fees liability if they ultimately lose on the merits, because the district courts and the courts of appeals both have procedures for weeding out insubstantial claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="873.914" offset="3637635">Now, the Court's decision in Anderson v.

            <text syncTime="885.953" offset="3685804">The court will look to the entire record, will apply Rule 56, as it ordinarily does, and will decide whether there's a genuine issue of material fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="1511.852" offset="6189380">For example, if the district court in Mitchell had not denied qualified immunity because it found the law was clear, but instead had denied it by erroneously holding that there was a dispute in the evidence in that case about whether there was a national security justification for the wire tap, the court of appeals in that kind of case has to look at the record to conclude that the district court was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.619" offset="6288436">Without correcting that error, the court of appeals would be unable to verify that the claim falls within the gray area and that qualified immunity is warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.684" offset="6316753">Now, that kind of review, the sifting of the evidence, has to be available in that case, otherwise Mitchell would have been deprived of immunity, his conduct would have been the same, the state of the law would have been the same, and the interest in prompt disposal in that case would have been the same as they were in the Mitchell case, so a refusal to consider a district court's error when it inheres in the evaluation of whether the facts meet the Rule 56 standard is something that has to be amenable to interlocutory review.</text>

            <text syncTime="1584.441" offset="6479757">The question presented here is whether there is an absolute right to an appeal, an interlocutory order denying a motion for summary judgment, where a trial judge found that there was a genuine issue of material fact in dispute, simply because the moving party is a public official who has also raised a qualified immunity defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.106" offset="6574425">That's what I hear as being the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.830" offset="6589262">The general rule is clear that with very narrow exceptions denials of motion for summary judgment are not immediately appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.784" offset="6629073">That's the law everyone is subject to, but you must wait for final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.419" offset="6655613">The reasons for the final judgment rule are to avoid delay and unnecessary appeals, precisely what would result if the decision below were not upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.997" offset="6709948">Thus, if only a claim in this case were assault and battery based on the same events that are alleged in this complaint, there's no dispute that there would be no interlocutory appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.187" offset="6766686">The only question is whether the fact the petitioners are police officers who claim qualified immunity because they allege they did not do the acts alleged, whether that changes the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.945" offset="6817782">In our view, the narrow exception created in Mitchell is just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.538" offset="6840142">It's a narrow exception, and it does not apply here, because much of the rationale for Mitchell is not present in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1717.057" offset="7010252">That should not get upstairs because Mitchell wanted cases to be dismissed before discovery.</text>

            <text syncTime="1738.431" offset="7095724">This case and cases like it necessarily require that discovery be done in order for an appellate court to, or district court to pour through a factually... a factual record, so one half of what Mitchell and this Court in Mitchell wanted isn't even present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.494" offset="7179943">Secondly, it's not the type of question that had ever been held by this Court to be appropriate for interlocutory appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.070" offset="7218291">It's a very different character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.432" offset="7227695">The appellate courts are to determine what is the state of the law and teach us in other cases, and police officers and other governmental officials, what is the clearly established law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.540" offset="7280149">They are to determine what is clearly established law, so the focus really is upon what is legal precedent, not what the facts are.</text>

            <text syncTime="3042.813" offset="12313213">I thought, and tell me if I'm wrong, this case is a very good case for an illustration, because there were two questions, one that did involve the interlocutory appeal, was there probable cause to arrest, a question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.942" offset="12369742">The court of appeals said yes, there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.635" offset="12376534">A perfect case for interlocutory appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.455" offset="12383849">Second issue: did the defendants, as alleged, beat up the plaintiff?</text>

            <text syncTime="3078.496" offset="12455946">Had the issue... the question of fact there been disputed, had there been some dispute as to what the arresting officers knew at the time of the arrest, the appellate court would have to have some factual basis for resolving the question of whether there was probable cause or whether a reasonable officer would have believed probable cause to exist, and the question then is, is the court stuck with what the district court said about whether there's a genuine issue of material fact, or may the appellate court make its own determination on that question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3111.038" offset="12586141">--Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg, the question is... there is a question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.852" offset="12609337">It's an easy question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.883" offset="12613517">Is what we say the defendants did violative of the Constitution?</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.476" offset="12627937">The answer is clearly no, but again, there is always going to be a question of law, an issue of law to be applied to the facts, and the question is, what facts should the Court assume in deciding that question of law?</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.142" offset="12670569">In the probable cause situation that you stated, again, you have to look to what the officers knew, and in looking to what the officers knew, you have to say, what did they know?</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.539" offset="12708185">Either they knew what the district court believed they knew, or the court of appeals can look to the record in deciding that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.040" offset="12726157">And if the court can do that in a question... in a case in which there is an unsettled question of law, it would be perverse to say that they can't do it where the law is clear that what the defendant did was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.277" offset="12763042">That would give more favorable treatment to defendants who might have or who actually did violate the Constitution than to those who clearly did not.</text>
