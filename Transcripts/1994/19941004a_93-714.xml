            <text syncTime="68.253" offset="421494">This is a case which contains within the question presented, as set forth in the Court's March 28th order, a much more narrowlyfocused question, and that question is whether the decision below should be vacated when after this Court granted certiorari the parties settled and mooted the case before this Court, and that settlement did not contain any agreement or condition requiring, or for that matter precluding vacatur.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.462" offset="526402">We also contend for a rule... a more general application, and that is that the established precedent confirmed in the Munsingwear decision and in later decisions of this Court which require vacatur upon mootness, that those decisions be generally adhered to in cases where mootness arises as a result of settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.483" offset="622428">And because that is the established practice of this Court, we believe that the burden should be on the respondent, Bonner, to demonstrate why that practice should be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.009" offset="668508">Our position here can be summarized rather succinctly 1) in a case like this one, where the Court has granted review so that the decision below is not final in the Federal statutory scheme and therefore there is no presumption of correctness, we believe, which attaches, vacatur is appropriate generally and in this specific case.</text>

            <text syncTime="902.009" offset="3756600">For example, in this case, the parties were negotiating prior to the filing of the bankruptcy case in 1991.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.632" offset="3783036">U.S. Bancorp had proposed certain settlement terms that it was willing to live with.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.115" offset="3801008">Those terms included very basic minimums that it required, a market rate of interest, an adequate loantovalue ratio, things of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.315" offset="3833818">Those terms were ultimately what was accepted by Bonner in January of 1994 and then some subject to certain other conditions which then also were met later so that the consensual plan could be confirmed in March of 1994.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.856" offset="3891914">Bonner was the party that made certain concessions and decided to forego reliance on the decision it had won in the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.882" offset="3936009">U.S. Bancorp did not exercise unilateral action.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.350" offset="3949906">When you look at the facts in that light, I think what you see is that U.S. Bancorp was in the position of having to choose in this dilemma whether to accept an economic settlement which was favorable on its terms or having to defend a decision, or to challenge a decision in the Ninth Circuit which the prevailing party was no longer willing to litigate and was willing to forego, so it is not unilateral action in that sense at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.072" offset="4064845">I think also that the fact that this Court granted certiorari is perhaps one of the most salient elements of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.506" offset="4110507">Another salient element is that the settlement which I briefly described was a bona fide settlement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1001.392" offset="4154079">There's no issue of a deep pocket attempting to purchase vacatur in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1310.781" offset="5391656">Well, several points I'd like to make in response to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.420" offset="5406180">Munsingwear was a discussion of the issue, but included in the Court's discussion in Munsingwear where the Court announced its general rule, it made no mention of the word happenstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.432" offset="5450275">The Court referred to its established practice when a case becomes moot, and cited a number of cases, four of which, as is pointed out in footnote 5 of petitioner's brief, involved settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.036" offset="5492698">So the Court was recognizing that the general practice that it had already established at the time of Munsingwear applied to settlement, so there was no need to separately discuss, no need on this Court's part to separately discuss how that rule should apply to settlement because the Court was already relying on cases that involved settlement, and that, the Court's following of that practice since that time simply confirms that there has been a general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.012" offset="5592590">The question before this Court is whether the Court should now depart from that general rule, and we think that respondent has shown no reasons for doing so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1814.908" offset="7408100">I, as a court of appeals judge, would have sent the whole thing back to the district judge to make a decision about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.435" offset="7438298">And the reason I would have had him do that is there are not many, but there are quite a few complex litigations involving cleaning up the Boston Harbor, for example, or managing mental health facilities, for example, and the vacating of a judgment might have significant implications on lots of other parties to the mental health litigation or the cleanuptheharbor litigation, and might have changed their whole strategy were something like that to come up, or might have all kinds of implications that only the district court would know about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.752" offset="7563476">Therefore, even had they agreed on the settlement, I would have sent it back to get the district court's determination about how it affects third parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="1878.117" offset="7660965">Moreover, 99 percent of the time, the appellant won't bother to ask for the vacating of the judgment, so sometimes it's there, sometimes it's not there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1918.366" offset="7821984">The second thing is that what causes... what leads the court to vacate the judgment is not the agreement of the party to vacate the judgment, it's the agreement of the party that settles the case which renders the case moot.</text>

            <text syncTime="1956.319" offset="7973808">We argue that this Court should not extend Munsingwear to mandate routine vacatur, or any kind of stipulated reversal upon settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.003" offset="8016544">We argue that such vacatur would erode certainty, it would allow for the manipulation of courts, including judge and forum shopping, and would directly challenge this Court's longheld belief in the fundamental importance of stare decisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.997" offset="8076521">Public confidence in our judicial system would be undermined if decisions could be bought and sold at will, and the only settlements that would be promoted by such a rule as the Government proposes would be in the rare but important cases where the court's future the court decisions' future impact and future results that a party might suffer has a present monetary value to one of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.313" offset="8201805">I would suggest that these impacts and these results go far beyond even the broadest possible reading of Munsingwear, which the Government does in its proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.714" offset="8247362">We suggest a better rule that is short and simple in its application no vacatur upon settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.821" offset="8279754">We believe this rule not only properly follows Karcher v. May, but it limits vacatur to its proper place, an equitable rule that is discussed in Munsingwear, and when mootness is due to circumstances beyond the parties' control, it is unfair to apply preclusion and collateral estoppel to those parties in that dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3383.214" offset="13681354">I would further like to argue, and argue in conclusion, that the decision of a court, this Court under these circumstances or any other court, is a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.255" offset="13745511">I don't believe you... that it can be avoided that this is a decision, it is a ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.549" offset="13766722">I do agree with the Government that it does, a vacatur does specifically vacate precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.576" offset="13798800">I don't know how the terms vacating can do anything with the Ninth Circuit opinion but to vacate precedent and relegate it to arguable authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.089" offset="13828894">Without happenstance, without this extrinsic event, this outside event, the decision that any court makes in a vacatur situation is made in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.913" offset="13872152">There are no grounds presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.257" offset="13877586">There's no reasoning presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.037" offset="13884691">There has still been no articulate reasoning of why the court should vacate by the bank, other than the Ninth Circuit might have been wrong, we couldn't find out, so there should be an asterisk by the decision that renders it not as precedent in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.515" offset="13946549">And you would be really in a situation of destroying existing parties... you couldn't avoid destroying existing... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.700" offset="13979359">You couldn't avoid destroying existing court decisions without it being on the whim of the parties if you adopted... if you extend Munsingwear the way the Government proposes to do it, which will be an automatic vacatur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.726" offset="14031395">It wouldn't be practical for this Court to have vacatur hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.349" offset="14049889">The better rule is simply to determine if it's happenstance that should be apparent, and it's moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.237" offset="14077475">If it's not, dismiss the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.299" offset="14085729">If they have grounds, if the losing party below has grounds to go to the circuit, 60(b)-type grounds, or go to the district court, they're not foreclosed by the refusal of this Court to vacate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3524.142" offset="14245076">Second of all, the distinction was raised in Karcher, and third, in the various circuits, right now, as we stand here, in the various circuits in either a majority, or nearly a clear majority of the circuits, Munsingwear is specifically limited to happenstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.368" offset="14321981">The courts now, with the Second and Tenth Circuit, are saying this.</text>
