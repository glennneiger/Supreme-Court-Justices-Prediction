            <text syncTime="13.724" offset="195597">Before the Court today is the question of whether the State of Oklahoma may constitutionally impose on the in-State purchaser and require the in-State vendor to collect a sales tax on the purchase of bus transportation sold within the State, the tax being measured by the full purchase price of the ticket even though the ultimate destination of the trip, or a portion thereof, is to be traveled beyond the State's borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.695" offset="323493">The facts of the case are basically very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.481" offset="338644">The State of Oklahoma has a general sales tax which taxes the sale of tangible personal property and certain services, including bus transportation by common carriers.</text>

            <text syncTime="124.226" offset="637589">Under the stipulations that are in the Joint Appendix, beginning at page 3, the intrastate routes and interstate routes that are operated or were operated by Jefferson involve... the intrastate being, of course, totally within the State of Oklahoma, and according to the stipulation the only sales involved in this case were those which originated in Oklahoma and terminated outside of the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="153.529" offset="754827">The stipulation seems inconsistent with something stated in the bankruptcy court opinion, and I just didn't know which one to think was the correct one.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stanley P. Johnston</label>
            <text syncTime="165.687" offset="803414">I... my memory of the opinion was that it did recognize that Jefferson sold other types of interstate trips in the State of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.061" offset="848972">For instance, round trips would be one type.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.680" offset="859421">The stipulation wasn't part of that, but that was a stipulation that is in the record, that these sales, the exact sales in question in this case were all those which originated in Oklahoma and extended outside the State, or had a destination outside the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.141" offset="933295">In that respect, Jefferson, while operating in Oklahoma and selling its bus trips and selling its bus tickets from various outlets and locations across the State for both intrastate and interstate trips... that is, extending beyond the State's borders, collected sales tax only on those bus tickets which were sold for intrastate trips.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.226" offset="1033605">Jefferson, of course, had a sales tax permit issued by... as a vendor by the State of Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Tax Commission, and dutifully reported all sales made in Oklahoma, both intrastate and interstate trips.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.466" offset="1090552">On the sales tax report, however, Jefferson then deducted those sales which were connected with interstate trips, did not collect or remit sales taxes on those sales, only the net.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.226" offset="1153560">Jefferson filed for bankruptcy, and office audits by the tax commission of Jefferson's sales tax report developed that the interstate trips, the tax was not being collected or remitted, and a claim was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.318" offset="1213955">Jefferson objected in the bankruptcy court to the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.853" offset="1228061">The bankruptcy court sustained Jefferson's claim that it violated... that the tax on these trips violated the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.793" offset="1263901">The court, of course, analyzed the State tax in view of the four-prong test of Complete Auto.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.999" offset="1308727">Analyzing and realizing that Jefferson is physically present in the State of Oklahoma when it makes all of these bus sales, these ticket sales, and that Jefferson's customers are physically present in the State when the sale is made, the bankruptcy court found that this presence satisfied both the nexus requirement of Complete Auto and also established that the State was providing services both to Jefferson and to its customers in connection with the sales transaction, and therefore the fourth prong was satisfied that the tax was fairly related to services provided by the taxing State.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.428" offset="1478418">As to the second prong of the Complete Auto test, however, that the tax be fairly apportioned, the court looked at the accepted test of whether or not the tax is internally consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.901" offset="1524289">That is whether, if every other State enacted the same tax, would there be multiple or double taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.639" offset="1547277">The court found that there is not, because, of course, a bus ticket can be sold in only one State.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.626" offset="1575176">As to the second portion, however, the bankruptcy court determined that the tax as it applies to interstate trips was not fully... fairly apportioned because the court envisioned that the tax was essentially the same as the tax in a prior case, Central Greyhound Lines v. Mealey.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.110" offset="1677158">However, in the case before this Court today, we are talking about a sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.514" offset="1702758">It is a tax on the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.966" offset="1712580">The taxable transaction is the sale itself, and it is not the thing that is purchased or the use of the thing purchased.</text>

            <text syncTime="405.290" offset="1761899">Mr. Johnston, one more background fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.226" offset="1777573">In the two bankruptcy proceedings that I think involved another bus company there was a statement that you tax even tickets that were sold outside the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.384" offset="1830236">Was... the bankruptcy judge thought that the tax reached transportation of... where the ticket was sold out of State.</text>

            <text syncTime="432.470" offset="1870569">--I... it's incorrect under the law, Your Honor, and you're speaking of the Greyhound case, which is an almost identical case which is currently pending in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.582" offset="1931068">The stipulations in that case were a bit broader than the stipulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.033" offset="1952802">They did not restrict themselves to trips, only to trips originating in Oklahoma and terminating outside insofar as interstate trips are concerned, but the... I'm sorry--</text>
