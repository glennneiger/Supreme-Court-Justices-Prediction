            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="144674">We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 93-1286, American Airlines v. Myron Wolens.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.689" offset="183335">Mr. Ennis.</text>

            <text syncTime="10.956" offset="188455">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.110" offset="209040">The Airline Deregulation Act categorically preempts any State law relating to airline rates, routes, and services.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.817" offset="251881">In 1988, American Airlines decided to change the rate for purchasing tickets through its frequent flyer program.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.471" offset="282496">Respondents challenged that decision on State law grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.375" offset="298170">They claim State law overrides American's express reservation of the right to change frequent flyer rules and awards at any time, and gives respondents a right to purchase tickets at the rate in effect before the change.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.218" offset="361490">In Morales, this Court ruled that the ADA broadly preempts State laws whose enforcement would have a connection with rates, routes, or services.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.275" offset="409765">That test requires preemption of respondent's statutory and common law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.012" offset="432648">Enforcement of either claim would have a direct impact on American's rates because it would require American to rescind its system-wide rate decision or pay substantial damages.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="85.487" offset="486565">What about a negligence claim arising out of a plane crash, Mr. Ennis?</text>
            <text syncTime="89.641" offset="503178">That certainly... I mean, if American, for example, wasn't held liable for negligence in plane crashes it certainly would affect its rates, probably affect its way of flying, too.</text>

            <text syncTime="100.247" offset="545601">Your Honor, in Morales this Court ruled that not every claim that literally relates to rates, routes, and services is preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.769" offset="575694">Some claims will have too tenuous an effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.554" offset="586875">We believe that those kinds of safety claims would generally not be preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.125" offset="609131">There are also indications in the text of the ADA and in the structure of the ADA that--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="122.945" offset="636403">--accidents can have a very powerful effect on service, can they not?</text>

            <label>Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="131.050" offset="668795">--Well, Justice Ginsburg, the Morales test stands for two propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.889" offset="692201">First, claims are preempted if the claims assert a direct right to a particular rate, route, or service, and those kinds of safety claims would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.762" offset="735668">The claims in this case would.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.229" offset="741520">Second, under the tenuousness exception of Morales, claims that would have an indirect effect on rates, routes, and services are preempted, but not if they're too tenuous.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.785" offset="779763">In our view, the way to understand that is to say that claims will generally be preempted if their indirect effect will have a significant impact on competitive decision-making regarding rates, routes, or services.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.378" offset="834098">If they are not likely to have a significant effect on competitive decision-making, then they are probably going to be too tenuous to warrant preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.234" offset="865549">That test, impact on competitive decision-making, is consistent with both the text of the ADA and the legislative purpose, which was to place maximum reliance on competitive decision-making on market forces.</text>

            <text syncTime="197.093" offset="932945">Your Honor, the actual formulation of the test in Morales was not mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.414" offset="950290">Morales simply said that claims will not be preempted if their effect on rates, routes, and services is too tenuous or peripheral.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.587" offset="982996">We have attempted to formulate, to flesh out a test that gives meaning to the tenuousness exception in Morales that is consistent with the text and with the legislative history, and in our view, that test, impact on competitive decision-making, would not generally preempt most safety claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="227.298" offset="1053840">What if a potential passenger has a ticket and a reservation that says, that guarantees him... I know airlines don't do it, but supposing we have an oddball airline that does, guarantees him passage on the 4:00 p.m. flight from Chicago to Washington, and he gets there, and he's just told, well, we've sold the place to somebody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.294" offset="1137850">He gets there in plenty of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.761" offset="1143701">So he simply wants to sue the airline for damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="256.348" offset="1170032">Generally, Your Honor, those kinds of denied boarding claims will be preempted, because most of those claims will assert a direct right to a particular rate, route, or service.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.273" offset="1213709">They can't be considered tenuous in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.541" offset="1222800">However, preemption of those claims will not leave passengers without a remedy, and will not create a major administrative burden for the DOT, because the DOT has already issued regulations governing denied boarding claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="333.733" offset="1479531">You said overbooking is preempted.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="338.819" offset="1499907">--Well, Justice Ginsburg, I have to answer that in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.887" offset="1512132">I think that most claims involving luggage would not be preempted under our test, but some would.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.875" offset="1536165">Let me explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.993" offset="1540553">If the claim challenges the liability limit that the airline has set for lost luggage claims, that claim would be preempted, because enforcement of that claim would have a significant impact on the airline's competitive decision regarding what the appropriate maximum limit should be, and that's consistent with DOT regulations which permit airlines to set maximum limits for luggage liability, so enforcement of that claim would impede Federal objectives and have a direct impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.012" offset="1656641">But if all we're talking about is the value of a particular piece of luggage within that limit, those kinds of claims generally would not be preempted, because they would not assert a right to a particular rate, route, or service directly, and their indirect connection would be tenuous.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.974" offset="1732501">Airlines are not going to change their competitive decisions regarding the appropriate liability limit just because a State court decides a bag is worth $300 instead of $200.</text>

            <text syncTime="407.913" offset="1776282">Mr. Ennis, is it your position that any subject or question or issue that's within the competence and the jurisdiction of the DOT is preempted?</text>

            <text syncTime="422.105" offset="1833020">That's not exactly our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.124" offset="1841170">Our position is that the... section 1305, the express preemption provision, is an express preemption provision, and the purpose of an express preemption provision is to preempt all laws within the sphere of laws whose enforcement might interfere with Federal objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.586" offset="1914940">This is not actual conflict preemption, this is an express preemption clause, so generally speaking, the answer is yes, that if it would be within the competence of the DOT to regulate, it could be preempted, but our test is not exactly the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="497.505" offset="2134682">The DOT could certainly come in and, by rule, prescribe a uniform rule for even those kinds of evaluation claims which would not, in our view, be preempted by section 1305 itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.147" offset="2181180">The point of the deregulation act was simply to take away regulation of the economic aspects of air carriage which had historically been supervised by the COB... CAB, now DOT.</text>

            <text syncTime="552.074" offset="2352961">The first was simply deregulation, get State governments off the airlines' backs with respect to rates, routes, and services.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.794" offset="2379815">But it also had, as a goal in itself, as an independent purpose, as this Court said in Morales, to place maximum reliance on competitive market forces.</text>

            <text syncTime="1292.988" offset="5316605">As this Court referred to in the Nader decision, the Department of Transportation's authority is to effectuate public rights, and it has the authority to protect its own regulations in compliance with its statute, but it does not have the authority to adjudicate private contract disputes between private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.818" offset="5399884">And that's consistent with the deregulation act insofar as what the act aimed to do was to encourage a free market where prices and production were determined precisely by private contract, as opposed to by tariffs or Government decision, and in our view the private market depends on the effectiveness of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.267" offset="5493716">One of the examples that Mr. Ennis gave was the limits on baggage liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.286" offset="5513778">That limit is a contract limit, and the ability of the airlines to enforce it against their passengers is, in fact, a matter of State contract law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.010" offset="5552648">The act's repeated references to contracts or agreements between private parties we think reflects Congress' assumption that contracts in a usual sense would remain effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.799" offset="5595802">The preemption clause, by its terms, preempts enforcement of law, not enforcement of contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.334" offset="5617954">That was the position of the Civil Aeronautics Board, which it took contemporaneously with the passage of the Airline Deregulation Act, and that's the position we take today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.725" offset="5655570">Our view is supported first by the text and structure of the act, including the text of the preemption clause, references elsewhere in the active contracts, the clause saving remedies, and the actions of any provision for an alternative Federal remedy for breach of contract rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1448.905" offset="5940201">Here, you have a situation where the Department does not have a mechanism for providing for the rights of passengers or others dealing with the airlines.</text>

            <text syncTime="1842.042" offset="7512772">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.100" offset="7553001">Contrary to Mr. Ennis' argument this morning, these claims were never considered by the DOT.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.854" offset="7588005">That case, which is part of the record, that DOT decision was a coupon broker rulemaking petition where the reasonableness or unreasonableness of those capacity control restrictions and those black-out date restrictions were at issue, and it is important to note that in that proceeding, American opposed the rulemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.904" offset="7692285">American opposed having the Department of Transportation regulate frequent flyer programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.593" offset="7719035">The plaintiffs in this case are not asserting a direct right to a particular rate, or a service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.782" offset="7755711">Even under the test proposed by Mr. Ennis, whether it has a significant impact on competitive decisions, the claims in this case would still not be preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.988" offset="7800537">The fundamental question that must be answered by the Court in this case is whether Illinois courts are precluded from enforcing contracts which airlines voluntarily enter into with other parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.081" offset="7856961">This case comes before the Court at the pleading stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.433" offset="7870336">It's based on a complaint alleging such a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.754" offset="7883606">Our contract happens to involve a frequent flyer program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.956" offset="7904400">It could involve food service, the purchase of gasoline, passenger terms... it doesn't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.411" offset="7938254">Congress did not intend to preempt these voluntary agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.965" offset="7960511">No matter what American argues in this case, they believe they have the right to enter into enforceable contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.004" offset="7996664">They enter into these contracts all the time, and they file lawsuits all over the United States trying to enforce them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.927" offset="8028325">It is curious that in all of the litigation filed by American which is noted in our brief, and there are literally tens of other cases they've filed, that American did not find themselves barred by the doctrine of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.536" offset="8094780">If American's position is correct, they cannot sue, either, to enforce their contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.125" offset="8129157">The enforceability of contracts was not addressed by this Court in Morales, a case where a group of State attorney generals sought to regulate fair advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.866" offset="8176073">This case is clearly not Morales, and it requires a different analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.337" offset="8198016">As this Court stated in Cipollone less than a month after Morales was decided, liability for breach of contract is measured by the terms of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.811" offset="8243887">Voluntary agreements involve duties undertaken by the contracting parties rather than those imposed by State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.000" offset="8276592">Such contracts can be enforced without undoing or undermining the Federal deregulatory scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="2130.331" offset="8665921">But there are circumstances... for example, in tort cases... where punitive damages would really not impact on the deregulatory scheme and therefore would not be preempted nor regulatory, so I don't think there can be a hard and fast rule that punitive damages would be preempted, but they're generally not available in contract claims for breach of contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="2423.718" offset="9839446">If there were a circumstance where the laws of all the States were so diverse as to be unduly burdensome on American, they could go to the Department of Transportation, they could ask for a rule on that subject matter, and that rule would take precedence over the State law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3287.696" offset="13295446">First, there is no textual basis for the Government's unworkable distinction between normative and nonnormative contract claims, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.935" offset="13332331">First, limiting preemption to State-imposed norms or policies is very much like limiting preemption to State-imposed requirements or prohibitions, which was the very different statutory language at issue in Cipollone, but section 1305 sweeps much more broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.265" offset="13413729">It preempts State laws that relate to rates, routes, and services, not just State laws that relate to rates, routes, and services and also impose State norms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.740" offset="13455629">Second, as this Court made clear and held in Morales, section 1305 preempts State laws even if the underlying State policy would be consistent with the Federal objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.298" offset="13505784">There is, therefore, no reason to have this normative distinction, because State laws that relate to rates, routes, and services are preempted regardless of what the underlying State policy is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.253" offset="13545595">The express preemption clause is designed to preempt a sphere where there's a risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.723" offset="13563463">Here, the risk is palpable because the impact of the statutory claim and the contract claim would be the same, and also--</text>

            <text syncTime="3365.948" offset="13608393">The respondents in this case are claiming a direct right to a particular rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.352" offset="13633993">Tort claims are not claiming a direct right to a particular rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.887" offset="13648204">Those are in the indirect, tenuousness exception of Morales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.339" offset="13661996">Second, the remedy that preempted claimants would have here is exactly the same Federal remedy as the Government agrees would be sufficient for the normative contract claims that the Government agrees should be preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.115" offset="13721033">Third, this case necessarily depends on State norms of unconscionability or inadequate notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.121" offset="13753112">The argument that the reservation clause does not apply is an argument that it did not adequately inform consumers that it would have a so-called retroactive effect.</text>
