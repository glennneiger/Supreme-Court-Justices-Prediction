            <text syncTime="19.212" offset="219273">The central issue in this case is whether Government can mandate the expression of messages and viewpoints in a privately organized parade over the objections of the private organizers.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.971" offset="278310">After ordering the respondent, the Irish-American Lesbian, Bisexual, and Gay Group of Boston, into the 1992 and 1993 parades, and after a hearing before a trial court, a judgment issued and was affirmed by the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts, and in that judgment the supreme judicial court upheld a statement and declaration by the trial court that a proper celebration of St. Patrick's and Evacuation Day requires diversity and inclusiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.131" offset="442986">This pronouncement reflects only one of the plain errors and misapplications of well-settled law that requires reversal and a vacation in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.689" offset="489170">The Veterans Council clearly stated what the expressive purpose of their parades were.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.795" offset="521562">They announced during trial and prior to their application, filing their application itself, that they wished to celebrate their traditional religious and social values.</text>

            <text syncTime="143.542" offset="716540">If that is done, then it will be seen that there were no facts at all to support any conclusion that my clients either discriminated or were conducting anything other than their own celebratory parade.</text>

            <text syncTime="268.440" offset="1216210">The first is you, I think you told Justice Kennedy not only that the parade was expressive in its nature... I guess all parades are in your view... but that that was crucial to your case.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.132" offset="1278904">You also said that the particular message, the viewpoint, if you will, was generally a celebration of religious and social values of Irish Catholics.</text>
