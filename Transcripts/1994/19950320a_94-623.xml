            <text syncTime="62.481" offset="382446">This case is before the Court on a writ of certiorari to the First Circuit Court of Appeals and concerns a perceived conflict between the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act and the Federal Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.390" offset="426123">The case arises from the sale of a cargo of oranges which was shipped from Morocco to Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.635" offset="451096">Petitioners subrogated underwriter of the purchaser of the cargo, and respondents are the vessel owner and the ship in rem.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.409" offset="482234">Among the commercial documents that the purchaser received from the shipper when it purchased the cargo was an ocean bill of lading that the vessel's agents had issued to the shipper in Morocco.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.928" offset="532284">Included in the fine print boilerplate clauses of the bill of lading was a Japanese law clause and a Tokyo arbitration clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.320" offset="561855">The purchaser first had notice of these clauses when it received the bill of lading from its bank, after it had paid for the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.977" offset="592471">By that time, the bill of lading terms were fait accompli.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.778" offset="607622">When the cargo arrived damaged in Massachusetts, petitioner filed suit in the district of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.383" offset="634058">Respondents moved under Chapter 1 of the FAA to stay the case pending arbitration in Tokyo.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.098" offset="660911">Petitioner opposed the motion on the grounds that the foreign arbitration clause was invalid as a prohibited lessening of the carrier's liability under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="175.435" offset="834260">They don't have it... their opinion... one of their footnotes I thought indicated that they didn't reach that issue, and that issue wasn't before them, so there was no... they were not ruling based on the state of Japanese law, and they were assuming that of course, if they were correct, that would be reached in the first instance by the arbitrator, but we don' have that before us to review in any case, do we?</text>

            <text syncTime="200.971" offset="936451">And in any event, even if it were arbitrated in Japan, would the case remain in the district court for purposes of ultimate review under whatever the standard is of review for arbitration?</text>

            <text syncTime="218.155" offset="1005205">Well, the district court would retain jurisdiction of the case, not least because it has in rem jurisdiction over the ship, so there is always the opportunity, after the arbitration in Japan were concluded, to come back to the court here and, for one reason or another, if there had been manifest disregard of the law, for example, to seek vacation of the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.868" offset="1088066">What the First Circuit did, in answer to Justice Souter's question, was simply defer the issue of what choice of law the arbitrators would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.603" offset="1126936">However, it is petitioners' position that there is simply no choice of law issue in this case, because COGSA itself applies to all bills of lading in United States trade, and this Court decided almost 100 years ago in the Knott case that choice of law clause in bills of lading are invalid, because they are directly in contravention of the express enacting provisions then of the Harter Act, today of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.305" offset="1253787">The enacting clause of COGSA, section 1300, says, the American COGSA, this act shall apply to all bills of lading in United States trade, and given that congressional directive, that Japanese law clause in this bill of lading was null and void, and what petitioner--</text>

            <text syncTime="388.337" offset="1685956">The... what Congress did when it enacted COGSA was yes, to model our COGSA to the American COGSA on the Hague Rules, but it nevertheless said that our statute shall apply to bills of lading in United States trade, and yes, it is true that it brought uniformity to international commerce, but that did not give the courts here in the United States license to disregard what is our statute, and all of the jurisprudence which has been developed over the last 60 years which supports what our interpretation of COGSA is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1065.030" offset="4392660">The authorities that were cited demonstrate in the United States the carrier has the nondelegable obligation to load and stow the cargo even if that cargo is loaded and stowed, as in this case, by stevedores hired by the shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.253" offset="4461623">In other words, the carrier simply can't delegate entirely to the shipper, or to the stevedores hired by the shipper, the responsibility for the safety of the cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.319" offset="4501852">In contrast, the Japanese Hague Rules impose the obligation to load only on the carrier and on those hired by him, which would exclude the stevedores in this case hired by the shipper, so the construction of Article 3, which is independent of the exception which Justice Scalia mentions in section 4, does create a significant difference between the Japanese law and the United States law, and if not proven as a matter of fact, as Judge Friendly mentioned in Indussa, in order to determine if, in fact, there would be any potential change in the law, you would simply have experts forecasting what a court might or might not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.558" offset="4678753">That itself, we believe, is unacceptable lessening of liability, because it removes the glue from what is otherwise a bona fide claim assertable here in the United States, and what the First Circuit did not do on the merits, if you conclude that in fact a bill of lading clause providing for foreign jurisdiction is invalid under COGSA, is a lessening of liability, it did not seek to reconcile the two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.868" offset="4800066">In particular, it did not determine whether or not COGSA, which is a Federal law, would have been a basis under the savings clause in section 2 of the FAA for finding that the bill of lading clause was revocable, and what it was the obligation, we believe, of the First Circuit to do, is attempt to reconcile those two statutes, not simply conclude, as the First Circuit did, that the two statutes were irreconcilably in conflict and then just pick one over the other, in this case the FAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.533" offset="4946665">If... if a bill of lading clause is invalid under COGSA, if it's a prohibited lessening of liability under section 3(8), it is then revocable at law within the meaning of the savings clause of section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.472" offset="5006433">Furthermore, apart from the literal terms of the savings clause, which makes these two statutes textually reconcilable, the policies which have animated this Court in its decisions on the Federal Arbitration Act don't come into play in this case, because there is no meaningful consent in bills of lading to any of the bill of lading terms.</text>
