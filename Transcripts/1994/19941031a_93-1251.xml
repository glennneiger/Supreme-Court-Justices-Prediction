            <text syncTime="66.464" offset="408581">Under the Medicare Act and section 413.9 of its implementing regulations, the United States reimburses the reasonable cost of services provided to Medicare beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.563" offset="456960">The Secretary of HHS makes the reimbursement determinations under the act subject to judicial review under the APA.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.407" offset="488307">This case concerns whether, in making these determinations, the Secretary is required by her regulations to apply generally accepted accounting principles even when she rationally determines in a particular case that application of those principles will not arrive at the reasonable cost for the services provided during the reimbursement period.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.312" offset="575974">In our view, the language of the regulations contains no such requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.895" offset="594259">Section 413.20 of the regulations, on which the court of appeals relied, specifies that providers are to maintain their cost records by use of standardized definitions and accounting procedures and practices, and states, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="127.814" offset="653923">"that essentially reimbursement under the act involves making use of that cost data to arrive at equitable and proper payment. "</text>
            <text syncTime="135.681" offset="685479">while nothing in these general admonitions about maintaining and using cost data to arrive at equitable and proper payment represents a clear, unambiguous and firm undertaking by the Secretary that she will always apply GAAP in reimbursement determinations.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.823" offset="1133949">For example, under accrual accounting, which is what the regulation talks about, or even under GAAP, a hospital with gold plumbing could arrive at a valid accounting statement for its actual depreciation costs.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.386" offset="1368215">The first point is whether these regs require that we imply... employ GAAP, and our point is, the text of the regulations doesn't require it, and it would be illogical for any such requirement to exist, because GAAP has only a remote relationship to whether costs are reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="898.026" offset="3734805">It came out of the Research Medical Center case in the Eighth Circuit, and what the court held... what that was about was where, in preconstruction of a facility, interest was accruing on a debt.</text>

            <text syncTime="916.198" offset="3807530">What the Secretary determined in a PRM was that this type of preconstruction interest should not be paid by Medicare, it should be capitalized until the building is finished, and then it should be reimbursed over an amortized period while the building's being used.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.709" offset="3869492">Now, the reason that she did it that way was because it is extremely important in Medicare to align the costs incurred over the periods benefited by this cost, precisely because the hospital's level of reimbursement, the percentage of its costs that are repaid, fluctuates depending upon the level of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.063" offset="3954965">And in the Research Medical Center case, the court gave the example of a cost incurred by a hospital in year 1 that provides benefits for 10 years, and the court said that if the Medicare payment, if Medicare paid that whole cost in year 1, and then the hospital stopped covering Medicare patients in years 2 and thereafter, the result would be Medicare fully paid for costs that benefited non-Medicare patients in other years.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.929" offset="4058410">That result would precisely contradict the statutory cross-subsidization rule, which is that Medicare funds shall not be used to provide benefits for non-Medicare patients.</text>

            <text syncTime="2677.170" offset="10851396">The prior manual provision that she applied to advanced refunding losses between December 31, 1976, and the issuance of manual provision 233, under that manual provision, Guernsey Memorial Hospital would have been entitled to the full Medicare portion of its advanced refunding loss in the year of the refinancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.066" offset="10942929">That is because, under the prior manual provision 215, Guernsey Memorial's loss qualified as a small loss, which was meaning it was less than 50 percent of what its interest expense otherwise would have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.115" offset="11011161">Therefore, under that manual provision, we would have received the full Medicare portion quite unlike what her treatment is now, when she's issued 233.</text>

            <text syncTime="2740.860" offset="11106142">This manual provision is a substantive rule under the APA because it creates a complicated new method for reimbursing advanced refunding losses.</text>

            <text syncTime="3084.572" offset="12481019">You attach it to the underlying asset, and it is amortized, very similar to... as what Justice Stevens was referring to, depreciation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3171.092" offset="12827089">There are two questions of interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.075" offset="12847046">The first is whether the Secretary is required by her regulations to apply GAAP in reimbursement determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.010" offset="12874736">Her consistent and contemporaneous interpretation of the regs has been that it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.593" offset="12897097">That interpretation has been set out in the manual, which makes quite clear that GAAP applies only if there is no other applicable manual provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.481" offset="12936594">It's been made clear in her litigation over the last 15 years on this subject, and her rational and contemporaneous, consistent interpretation should be given controlling weight in understanding her own regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.137" offset="12987272">Now, the other question of interpretation is whether the amortization of these types of advance refunding costs are rationally to be related to the periods over which they benefit the hospital by reducing its costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.319" offset="13051951">For the reasons that we've explained, it seems eminently rational.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.370" offset="13068147">The courts below agreed with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.613" offset="13077133">And not to quibble, but there were three dissents to the GAAP opinion, but one of the part... one of the members of that opinion who assented to the opinion also believed that amortization would have been proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.020" offset="13122795">This is an issue on which accrual accounting could reach different conclusions, and the conclusion reached by the Secretary as to that substantive question was not unreasonable or arbitrary, and I should point out that in Thomas Jefferson University, when the Court emphasized the deference which the Secretary's decision should be given... the Court emphasized that these kinds of determinations involve the application of policy judgments to the facts of the--</text>
