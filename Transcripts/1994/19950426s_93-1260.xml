            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87125">I have the opinion of the Court to announce the number 93-1260, United States versus Lopez.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.204" offset="115860">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Court of the Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.933" offset="134772">After respondent, then a 12th-grade student carried a concealed handgun into his high school.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.988" offset="159014">He was charged with violating the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, which makes it a federal offense for any individual to knowingly posses a firearm within a thousand feet of a public or private school.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.845" offset="214498">Respondent was convicted but the Court of Appeals reversed that conviction because it concluded that the Gun-Free School Zones Act was invalid as beyond Congress' power under the Interstate Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.924" offset="266743">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.851" offset="286492">The constitution creates a federal government of enumerated powers and delegates to Congress the power to regulate commerce among the several states.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.054" offset="323272">Our cases have long upheld federal regulation of a wide variety of commercial activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.343" offset="356395">The Guns-Free School Zones Act however goes further.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.648" offset="373636">It neither regulates a commercial activity, nor contains a requirement of the possession of the firearm be connected in anyway to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.987" offset="411043">To uphold the act we would have to pile inference upon the inference in a manner that would bid fair to convert Congressional Authority under the Commerce Clause to a general police power of the sort retained by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.215" offset="463915">To do so, it would require us to obliterate the distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.168" offset="487739">So, this is something we are unwilling to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.603" offset="497456">We hold that Congress in enacting the Gun-Free School Zones Act exceeded its authority under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.416" offset="524728">Justice Kennedy has filed a concurring opinion and joined by Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.969" offset="542909">Justice Thomas has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.901" offset="554717">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.729" offset="566002">Justice Souter has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.383" offset="580630">In addition, Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg and I have filed a dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.519" offset="609156">In our view, the statute falls well within the scope of the constitution's commerce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.268" offset="636114">In reaching this conclusion, we apply three well-established legal principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.726" offset="657953">First, Congress can regulate acts within a single state but significantly affect commerce among the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.373" offset="692539">Second, in deciding whether that is so, the court must consider not a single instance; say if the single gun in a school, but the cumulative effects of many similar instances of all guns that are in or near schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.944" offset="762861">Third, the court must also give Congress considerable leeway that is to say, the court must ask not whether there is in fact a significant Commerce Clause connection but only whether Congress could rationally believe so.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.687" offset="829838">Applying these standards, it seems clear to us that Congress could believe that guns in schools are now to a commercial as well as a human problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.984" offset="879053">A host of government reports, hearings and studies set forth facts that show; one, that guns in schools is a serious problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.109" offset="927536">One study for example says that 6% of intercity children carry guns to school, the 12% have been shot out and up to 20% have been threatened.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.472" offset="980931">Two, that school violence significantly impairs learning.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.611" offset="1001515">Three, that learning, reading, writing, arithmetic has long accounted for much of our nation's economic growth, and today and in the future in a world of high technology and global economic competition, the differences between classrooms that teach and those that do no, may well spell the difference between high paying jobs and unemployment between firms locating in a community or staying away in a word between prosperity and poverty.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.937" offset="1142785">At the least, Congress could have a come to such a conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.866" offset="1158563">It could have found guns in schools, antithetical to a well-educated workforce and it could reasonably have believed that an educated workforce in today's world gives a community the kind of advantage comparable to that, given by location near a railhead or harbor in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.413" offset="1244767">This court has long recognized to 'Justice Holmes', that commerce is a practical not a technical legal conception.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.324" offset="1288340">It also has long proved willing to apply preexisting Commerce Clause Law to changing economic circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.082" offset="1327419">That being so, the reasonableness of Congress' factual beliefs should have proved sufficient bases for finding the connection with interstate commerce that the constitution requires and holding he Gun-Free School Zones Act constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.878" offset="1402547">Such a holding would be consistent with if not dictated by this court's prior President.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.008" offset="1431073">For these and other reasons we dissent.</text>
