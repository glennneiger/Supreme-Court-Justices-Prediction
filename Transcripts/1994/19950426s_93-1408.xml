            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="15.287" offset="148046">This case comes to us on Writ of Certiorari to the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.644" offset="165495">As part of a hospital rate setting scheme, New York requires hospitals to collect surcharges from patients covered by a commercial insurer but not from patients insured by Blue Cross Blue Shield Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.345" offset="212202">It also subjects certain health maintenance organizations the surcharges depending on the number of Medicaid recipients the HMO has enrolled.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.041" offset="246997">Commercial insurers and HMO sued state officials, claming that the Federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or ERISA preempts the surcharges.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.364" offset="296317">ERISA regulates employee benefit health plan some of which provide commercial health insurance or HMO membership as a means of resting the regulation of such plans away from the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.432" offset="340620">The act provides the preemption of state laws that relates to any covered employee benefit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.337" offset="376251">The district court found that the New York surcharges just were preempted because they could lead to an increase in ERISA plan’s cost and that the purpose of the surcharge was to increase the relative attractiveness of ensuring a Blue Cross Blue Shield and to make membership in HMO that enroll only few Medicaid recipients relatively expensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.459" offset="456708">The Court of Appeals agreed holding this purposeful interference for the choices that ERISA plan make for healthcare coverage triggered the preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.040" offset="499027">In an opinion filed with the clerk of court today, we reversed the judgment of the Second Circuit and hold that New York surcharges do not relate to ERISA plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.192" offset="535598">To give content for the limitation on preemption, we look to ERISA’s objective and find that the principle purpose of preemption was to avoid multiplicity of regulations not to issue a national cost uniformly and that this purpose does not require a preemption of the surcharges.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.271" offset="595993">Moreover, they hold that ERISA preempts New York surcharges would be inconsistent with Congress’ silence regarding substantial state efforts underway in 1974 to regulate healthcare cost and it would render a legal nullity, Congress’ approval just months after ERISA, a federal assistance to those state efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.114" offset="675301">The opinion is unanimous.</text>
