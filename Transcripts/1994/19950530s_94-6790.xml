            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="10.065" offset="127106">This case concerns the meaning of the words “in custody” as those words are used in the Federal Habeas Corpus statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.765" offset="165871">A prisoner, who wants to attack a state conviction as unconstitutional, may do so in Federal Court to a Habeas Corpus petition only if he is still in custody under the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.361" offset="224281">The petitioner here Harvey Garlotte, plead guilty in a Mississippi State Court in 1985 to a charge of marijuana possession, and two murder charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.624" offset="269316">Sentences were imposed in this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.302" offset="280079">First, a three year term for the marijuana conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.727" offset="293767">Second, two life terms to run concurrently on the murder charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.387" offset="316337">The two life terms were consecutive to that is they were to be served after the three year marijuana term.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.577" offset="349146">Soon after these sentences were imposed, Garlotte commenced attacks on the marijuana conviction in Mississippi state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.676" offset="381538">When his claims were unsuccessful at the state level, he sought federal habeas relief again attacking the marijuana conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.873" offset="418319">By that time however, Garlotte had completed service of the prison period set for the marijuana offence, and had begun serving the life sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.462" offset="456666">The state of Mississippi maintained that because Garlotte has served at the prison term imposed for the marijuana conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.573" offset="485088">He was no longer in custody as required by the Habeas statue.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.066" offset="503060">United States Courts of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit agreed with the state, and therefore rejected Garlotte’s Habeas petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.450" offset="536601">We hold that Garlotte was in custody under the marijuana conviction when he found his federal habeas challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.202" offset="567635">Accordingly, we reverse a decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.754" offset="581845">To define in custody, we rely primarily on a 1968 decision of this court Peyton against Rowe.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.456" offset="616640">That case involved two Virginia prisoners, both of them incarcerated under state imposed consecutive sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.950" offset="646629">We allow the prisoners in Peyton to reply for federal habeas relief from sentences they had not yet begun to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.368" offset="680275">We said in Peyton that for purposes of the “in custody” requirement, we review consecutive sentences as a continuous series flowing together as one stream and not as totally discrete units.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.203" offset="731684">The statutory words in custody should not be given a meaning here different from the meaning we gave those words in Peyton simply because the sentence imposed under the challenge conviction lies in the past rather than in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.098" offset="795213">Justice Thomas has filed the dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice joins.</text>
