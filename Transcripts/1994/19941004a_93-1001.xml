            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="143953">We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 93-1001, Allied-Bruce Terminix Companies, Inc. v. Michael Dobson.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.889" offset="187421">Mr. Farr.</text>

          <turn speaker="h_bartow_farr_iii" startTime="12.299" stopTime="97.866">

            <text syncTime="12.299" offset="193063">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.372" offset="209364">The Alabama law applied by the courts below declaring all predispute arbitration agreements to be unenforceable as a matter of public policy, embodies precisely the sort of hostility to arbitration that prompted Congress to enact a Federal arbitration act in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.696" offset="286686">Nevertheless, the Alabama courts held that the Federal law did not apply to this case, saying that the reach of the act is limited to transactions in which the parties contemplated substantial interstate activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.605" offset="346350">We think this reading of Federal law is too narrow, for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.158" offset="364531">First, the best reading of the language and history of the act indicates that Congress meant to exercise its Commerce power fully, except as it is specifically provided in the definitions and the exceptions contained in section 1 of the act, and second, the benefits to commerce that Congress sought to obtain through enforcement of arbitration agreements... greater certainty in dealings, lower litigation costs, fewer litigation delays, and ultimately the lower cost of goods and services... apply to all transactions within the scope of the Commerce power, not just to some of them.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="97.866" stopTime="105.740">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="97.866" offset="535372">Mr. Farr, I suppose... now, this act was adopted in what year?</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="107.242" stopTime="116.639">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="107.242" offset="572884">Right, and as of that time, I suppose we didn't have as broad a view of Commerce power as we have today?</text>

          <turn speaker="h_bartow_farr_iii" startTime="116.639" stopTime="134.912">
            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="116.639" offset="610500">Well, Your Honor, the best evidence I think that we have of that in 1925 is first of all Congress' own view as reflected briefly in the House report, which indicated that the Commerce power extended to all contracts relating to interstate commerce.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="134.912" stopTime="143.319">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="134.912" offset="683538">Well, you would acknowledge, though, that we had a narrower view of the Commerce Clause power in 1925 than we have today?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="h_bartow_farr_iii" startTime="143.319" stopTime="174.458">
            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="143.319" offset="717184">Just O'Connor, I think it was not uniformly as broad as it is today.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.830" offset="735261">I would certainly admit that.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.262" offset="740903">However, if one looks, for example, at the brief that was submitted on behalf of the ABA to Congress in 1924, actually, I believe, that refers to a very broad definition of the Commerce power, indicating that it reached not just matters that in fact involved the crossing of State lines, but purely intrastate matters that had an effect on interstate commerce.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="174.458" stopTime="243.413">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="174.458" offset="841736">Well, of course, my view, as expressed in the Southland case, is that Congress didn't intend to do more in this Federal Arbitration Act than affect what happens in Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.416" offset="893563">This Court has rejected that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.549" offset="906102">I still think that was correct, but faced with Southland, do you think that we should properly give some meaning to the words that Congress used involving Commerce, evidencing, the word evidencing... do the use of those words indicate some narrower reach of the statute than you would have us adopt?</text>
            <text syncTime="223.111" offset="1036296">There are many laws out there among the States that try to protect consumer contracts from having arbitration clauses, and preserving the rights of people to sue, and your view would sweep all of those aside, and I'm concerned that that wasn't what Congress had in mind.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="h_bartow_farr_iii" startTime="243.413" stopTime="306.481">
            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="243.413" offset="1117589">Well, Justice O'Connor, let me make two points, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.576" offset="1126157">Of course I would say that the Court ought to give meaning to the words that Congress used, as I hope to explain this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.283" offset="1156982">I don't think that those words support a narrow interpretation of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.288" offset="1177044">But before, perhaps, I turn to that, I'd like to make clear that the issue regarding the construction of the scope of the act overlaps with but is not the same issue, precisely, as the issue whether the act preempts State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.349" offset="1241305">The Court has said that the Federal act does not occupy the field, and does not preempt all State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.776" offset="1279026">For example, I think it is understood now that State laws of general applicability can be applied to arbitration agreements and, indeed, the language of section 2 itself, which provides that they can be provoked on grounds applicable to any contract would suggest that, and the court in the Stanford University case indicated that the parties could in fact incorporate State law.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.481" offset="1369827">Mr. Farr, can I ask... this is a very interesting point that you're making.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.993" offset="1383829">If Alabama had a statute similar to, say, I think Georgia has one of these statutes that, there's a dollar limit and they exclude consumer contracts of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.679" offset="1414653">Would you say, then, the Federal act would not apply here, if Alabama had a statute like that, rather than just a 100 percent policy against--</text>

            <text syncTime="325.756" offset="1446941">No, I would say, without knowing exactly the details of the transaction, the act might well apply but would not necessarily preempt whatever the State law is.</text>

            <text syncTime="336.703" offset="1490722">--Where the State law says certain contracts are not subject to arbitration, certain consumer contracts are not, how could it apply without preempting it?</text>
            <text syncTime="345.170" offset="1524577">That's what I don't quite understand.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.652" offset="1530533">Well, if that's... if the definition of the law is a very narrow law that is aimed at arbitration agreements itself, I think in fact it probably would be preempted--</text>

            <text syncTime="383.269" offset="1677027">--Well, let me try to use an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.711" offset="1686745">If, for example, a contract was signed by someone representing that they have authority to sign for a corporation and they do not, that can be applied to make the arbitration agreement, as well as any other parts of the contract, unenforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.752" offset="1750902">It's possible if a State law, for example, had... a State had a law that said, all provisions that are not on the face of the contract must be separately initialed by the parties, then it seems to me that one could say that's not something that aims at arbitration, not something that is intended to make arbitration more difficult itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="434.145" offset="1880469">That would be preempted by the Federal, no question, and I should make clear to... just by way of clearing up any of this introduction, as far as this case is concerned there is no question in our mind that the Alabama law being applied here has to be preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.998" offset="1951940">This is... the Alabama law that we are talking about here says, we do not enforce arbitration agreements simply because they're an arbitration agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="465.248" offset="2004916">I believe that Justice Stevens was referring to his position in Southland that the State could carve out certain kinds of contracts like franchise agreements, and you have given, do I understand you correctly, to say no, that can't be done?</text>

            <text syncTime="481.999" offset="2071894">I think I can't give an absolutely clear answer for every case, because it depends on the particular nature of the State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.565" offset="2110137">At least the way I believe the correct analysis would be is that one would look at the nature of the State law, how broadly does the State law apply?</text>
            <text syncTime="500.461" offset="2145769">If it applies to all the agreements, including arbitration agreements, that seems to me it puts it on the side where it is not preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.097" offset="2180250">If it applies exclusively to arbitration agreements, it clearly puts it on the side of the line where it is preempted.</text>

            <text syncTime="516.203" offset="2208671">I mean, it seems to me the conflict with Federal policy is just as severe in either case.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.337" offset="2233226">Whether it's sort of a penalty against a State for singling out arbitration agreements, I mean, as far as the conflicts with Federal law is concerned, whether it's a general law or a specific law addressed to arbitration agreements, it has the same result.</text>

            <text syncTime="535.907" offset="2287561">But I think one starts with the language of section 2, and the language of section 2 says that agreements to arbitrate, within the field, which I will discuss this morning, are enforceable save on grounds that are sufficient for revocation of any contract and, therefore, it seems to me that, when one is looking at State law seeking to be applied to an arbitration agreement and seeking to say that it makes it enforceable, one... the first inquiry, naturally, one makes is, is this grounds for revocation of any contract?</text>

            <text syncTime="628.240" offset="2656828">With that exception, though, however, we do believe that the correct reading of this language in fact does indicate that Congress intended to reach all contracts that are within its power under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.669" offset="2714611">The word "involving" commerce, for example, the word "involving" is, among its meanings, synonymous with the word "affecting".</text>

            <text syncTime="1406.456" offset="5769684">So if it simply is a jurisdictional statement, but it is not a finding by Congress that all arbitration are within the jurisdiction, I don't see what function it has.</text>

            <text syncTime="1597.021" offset="6531937">Justice O'Connor asked Mr. Farr if the... a broad reading of the statue would in fact sweep away State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.761" offset="6578957">That is our position exactly, that a broad reading of section 2, particularly to the limits of the constitutional powers of Congress, would, in fact, sweep away a great amount of State law and, in fact, we cannot imagine congressional intent in 1925 for Congress to regulate contracts where people in a city arrange to have insects in their home sprayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.319" offset="6681148">We cannot imagine a congressional intent to reach that far into traditionally State matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.043" offset="6704031">I would like to turn first in this question of statutory construction to the express language of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.578" offset="6738200">I would like to draw into that the legislative history, because we draw different conclusions from the legislative history as the ones that Mr. Farr has outlined for you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.954" offset="6779682">First, the choice of the word "involving" commerce we believe is important, because, as the Chief Justice has mentioned, traditionally the word "affecting" commerce has been used when Congress wanted to use all of its constitutional power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.638" offset="6850422">The question was asked whether that was a term of art in 1925.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.839" offset="6867244">Well, we don't... we can't look into the minds of the Congressmen that voted on that act, but we... what we can say is that they were aware that they had less than... that they had more power than to only regulate contracts which were directly in commerce, and the reason I say that is that our cite in footnote 17 of our brief to two cases of that era, and as the Will v. Department of State Police case tells us, that's what we look to, are the authorities of the era.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.562" offset="7002141">We don't know, as Justice Scalia mentioned yesterday, exactly what these Congressmen were thinking about in 1925, or whether they read Supreme Court precedent, but nevertheless, in trying to give some meaning to the word 1922.</text>

            <text syncTime="1770.571" offset="7226167">That case talked about the fact that on the one hand Congress had power to regulate matters which were in the current or flow of commerce, and in talking about what was in the current or flow of commerce, they used the words, matters which involve commerce intrinsically, involving commerce intrinsically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.046" offset="7316133">Now, whether that was a specific language that Congress had reference to 2 years later when they passed this act, we cannot know, but that was an authority of the era, and the same language was used again in the United Leather Workers case 2 years later.</text>

            <text syncTime="3201.956" offset="12951685">We would suggest that if the jurisdictional inquiry is made, and once the Court gives some definition to the term, involving commerce, then the Court could fashion a rule or a test if it's dissatisfied with the contemplation-of-the-parties test to properly define the jurisdiction of section 2.</text>

            <text syncTime="3268.861" offset="13219388">Your Honor, I'm sorry, I don't have all the answers to the questions of exactly what the test would say, and part of that difficulty is that, at least the way I see this case, the first question that the Court needs to address is, what is the jurisdictional reach of the act, and to my way of thinking about it, it seems to me that normally what this Court has done is first determine what the jurisdictional reach of the statute is and then, secondly, try to fashion a test that will lead courts which inquire about that in the right direction, and we feel like something akin to, if not exactly like, the contemplation of the parties test would lead in that direction if the Court construes the jurisdictional reach of the act as we think it should.</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="3322.747" offset="13434846">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.410" offset="13445504">I have just two points that I would like to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.590" offset="13454281">First, with respect to the contemplation of the parties, it has yet at least been explained to my ear why Congress would want the scope of the act to turn on the parties' contemplation about interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.480" offset="13517811">The logic of this argument, as I understand it, is that even though the parties solemnly agree in a written contract to arbitrate their disputes, if they do not, on the face of the same contract, say something about interstate commerce, it means that they are not intending Federal law to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.225" offset="13600776">In the first place, I don't think that is a logical inference to draw from it and, secondly, I can't imagine that Congress would intend that that undisclosed inference be the basis for deciding whether Federal law applied or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.723" offset="13658768">The second point I'd like to make is that one has to look, I think, at the reasons that Congress wanted to make arbitration agreements enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.580" offset="13702235">They had several thoughts in mind, 1) that it would provide some sort of greater certainty in dealings, but in particular that it would lower the cost of litigation, it would lower delays, or reduce delays that were associated with disputes that arise out of agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.333" offset="13773184">Now, what you have in this particular case is simply a contract for the sale of goods and services, a standard, garden-variety contract, one that we believe involves interstate commerce, for sale of a service involving goods to a citizen in another State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.475" offset="13841834">Now, what is there about that contract that makes it inappropriate for arbitration, as Congress viewed arbitration?</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.170" offset="13876629">Indeed, the legislative history talks about dealings such as a farmer selling his potatoes to an out-of-State dealer, and makes reference to that clearly, I think, suggesting that that would be within the coverage of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.861" offset="13935352">Now, this may seem like a mundane transaction, if one thinks of interstate commerce in some grand sense, but in fact, arbitration in contracts like this also can reduce costs, can reduce the burden on the courts, and ultimately can reduce prices to the very consumers who sign contracts like this, and those policies clearly apply to what everybody agrees is the scope of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.476" offset="14037857">Thank you.</text>
