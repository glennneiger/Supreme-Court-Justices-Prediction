            <text syncTime="85.388" offset="480767">In this habeas action, Mr. Garlotte challenges the conviction that resulted in the 3-year term, and the question in the case is whether Mississippi's treatment of all of Mr. Garlotte's consecutive sentences as a single, essentially general sentence for penalogical purposes means that Mr. Garlotte was in custody for purposes of habeas corpus when he began this action in 1989.</text>

            <text syncTime="358.757" offset="1574252">But you have a different argument, as I understand it, based on Peyton.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.566" offset="1597554">You're saying the reason the sentences were amalgamated in Peyton in order to be able to "anticipate" a sentence for purposes of habeas attack was to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement that he be in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.576" offset="1661501">Well, if you can amalgamate in order to anticipate, the you've got to follow the same jurisdictional rule when in fact you're looking backwards, so I think you're... you have a separate argument saying you can't have Peyton for jurisdictional purposes and not allow me to attack, i.e. on the basis of custody for jurisdictional purposes, and that's a separate argument, isn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="406.096" offset="1763588">I mean, that's an argument based on Peyton, and you're saying you can't have it both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.251" offset="1776231">That's correct, Justice Souter.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.298" offset="1780411">The principle that derives from Peyton is that a prisoner serving consecutive sentences is in custody under any one of those sentences for the balance of his confinement.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.590" offset="1837567">Why can't you say, you know, the law makes up these categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.604" offset="1853658">There's no such thing as, you know, whether it's separate or amalgamated.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.837" offset="1870585">It's simply how you choose to look at it, and we choose to look at it as amalgamated in Peyton in order that you didn't have to wait a long time before you could try the factual matters necessary to determine the earlier incarceration, but in this case that practicality cuts in precisely the opposite direction, doesn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="455.171" offset="1959924">Oh, undoubtedly there were practical considerations that motivated the Court in Peyton, and those you described, and it is clear that the rule that we propose would permit Mr. Garlotte to challenge his marijuana conviction for as long as he remains in iron bar confinement in Mississippi, just as it would permit another prisoner serving a life sentence to challenge that life sentence for as long as he remains confined.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.677" offset="2077998">But the practical considerations that motivated the Court in Peyton led to a principle in the case that obviously spans beyond the narrow factual circumstances that the Peyton Court confronted, and the principle is that the prisoner serving consecutive sentence is for all intents and purposes really serving a general sentence on multiple convictions, and can bring the petition in time.</text>

I can't remember the exact words, but if he commits a serious violation of prison rules 20 years from now the State, under my reading of the Mississippi statutes, can withdraw that earned time, and in that situation, of course, he will be deemed to have begun technically serving the life sentences a year-and-a-half later.</text>

            <text syncTime="882.926" offset="3670945">I think that argument is the one that is foreclosed by Peyton, and quite clearly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.268" offset="3700306">Virginia in that case tried to block a prisoner from challenging the second of two sentences... I think they were 30 and 20-year sentences... in that case on the ground that he'd only been in prison a few years and hadn't yet begun to serve the second term.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.448" offset="3773031">Observing that the prisoner in that case had a single parole date under Virginia law, the Court held that he was for all practical terms serving a 50-year sentence and it would be treated as such for habeas purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.097" offset="3835621">Essentially, what the Court held is that the sentence under which a prisoner is technically marking time is... that question whether the prisoner is marking time under the challenged sentence is a separate one from whether he is held or in custody under the conviction, and that's amplified by some of the Court's other decisions, Hensley v. Municipal Court, Estelle v. Dorrough, and Braden v. 30th Judicial District Court, which permit a prisoner to challenge confinement that he is scheduled to serve in another jurisdiction before that... before he's begun to serve that confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.786" offset="3978354">I think the theory is that in that situation the prisoner is not only being held by the first jurisdiction to discharge the first sentence, but he's also being held in anticipation of serving another sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.516" offset="4029345">Mississippi relies a great deal on Maleng v. Cook, and submits that the issue has already really been decided in Maleng, but all Maleng held was that a sentence or a conviction that no longer poses any present restraints on a prisoner does not become a source of custody for purposes of Federal habeas corpus simply because it's been used to enhance a sentence upon a subsequent conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1056.247" offset="4364234">The only continuing influence of that prior conviction, in fact, was the prisoner's status as a felon, which was obviously influential to the sentencing judge in the subsequent conviction in seeing that the prisoner is a danger and thus enhancing the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.523" offset="4433302">I think the principle to be derived from Maleng is that in that situation where a prior fully expired conviction is used to enhance a sentence for a subsequent offense, that the source of the prisoner's injury and the proper object of his habeas petition is that subsequent sentence, that subsequent conviction, and that's in fact what the Court held in that case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Brian D. Boyle</label>
            <text syncTime="3147.515" offset="12729270">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.015" offset="12735330">I'd like to make just a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.561" offset="12745465">First, on the question whether it would be possible to parse consecutive sentences according to whether the prisoner is marking time in those sentences, another thought occurred to me, sitting down, and this is amplified in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.133" offset="12807741">In Mississippi, as I think in most States, the sentences are really discharged in dovetail fashion, so that when Mr. Garlotte's initial parole eligibility comes around in March 1996, he will still have the balance of his life terms to serve as well as a parole term on the marijuana conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.859" offset="12878690">This is not idle imagination, either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.921" offset="12890915">One of the cases we cite, Williams v. Puckett, describes a situation where a prisoner who was on probation committed a subsequent offense, was sentenced upon that offense, and had his probation revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.933" offset="12935010">The order in which the Department of Corrections considered those sentences satisfied was first the mandatory term on the revoked probation, second, the minimum parole term on... actually, it was a nonparolable offense, armed robbery, that entire 10-year term next, and finally the parole term on the original offense, so it's... they really are discharged in dovetail fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.017" offset="13031350">Then also, in response to Justice Breyer's question, which is an intriguing one, I think this case, of course, illustrates the direct restraint that is posed by Garlotte's marijuana conviction, but I think even beyond the date of initial parole eligibility, like in the year 15 or 20, the sentences still are treated as a general sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.258" offset="13120270">The earned time that he has on his marijuana conviction is carried forward and can be forfeited at any point, and if the marijuana conviction is invalidated, he can get credit for that service on his life sentences, even at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.080" offset="13171575">If there are no further questions, thank you.</text>
