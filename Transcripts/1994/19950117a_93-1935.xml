            <label>Mr. Laurence Reich</label>
            <text syncTime="66.073" offset="411020">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="68.956" offset="422514">The issue in this case is the effect of section 402(b)(3) of ERISA on a plan term included in a governing plan document, a summary plan description, issued by a plan sponsor that had reserved the right to modify, amend, or terminate the plan from its inception as an ERISA plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.720" offset="505583">It does not concern the right of the plan sponsor to terminate company-paid retiree medical benefits, which the lower courts agreed it has.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.278" offset="547797">Section 402(b)(3) provides simply that every employee benefit plan shall provide a procedure for amending such plan and for identifying the persons who have authority to amend the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.633" offset="597221">In considering the requirements of section 402(b)(3), it should be kept in mind that ERISA applies to a variety of employee benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.934" offset="650406">Initially, there is the dichotomy between pension plans and welfare plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.228" offset="675588">Pension plans are subject to a panoply of regulations in part 1 of ERISA that do not affect welfare plans Some pension plans are subject to substantive regulation under title 4 of ERISA that affect only pension plans and not welfare plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.882" offset="750194">Most pension plans have some concern with Internal Revenue Code requirements that do not affect welfare plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.436" offset="780496">In each category, there may be plans that have trustees involved and plans that do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.541" offset="812887">The presence of a trustee obviously impacts upon the need for... upon the procedure for amendment, since a trustee may require that amendments be made... affecting it be made only with its consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.273" offset="875790">Some plans are adopted unilaterally by a plan sponsor as a voluntary matter, and other plans are adopted under the provisions of a binding collective bargaining agreement which obviously adds a layer of complexity to the amendment of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.026" offset="958860">Other plans, both pension and welfare, are single employer plans, and some multiemployer plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.059" offset="978922">In many cases, multiemployer plans, and even, indeed, single employer plans, will involve regulations under section 302 of the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.000" offset="1034719">The Curtiss-Wright plan is the very simplest of all these plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.242" offset="1051647">It is a voluntary, single employer plan unilaterally adopted by the employer, not... no collective bargaining agreement involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.949" offset="1082471">There is... and there is no trustee, and as a welfare plan it is subject to no substantive regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.483" offset="1112669">As far as the amendment... requirements for amendment procedure of section 402(b)(3) are concerned, there is nothing in ERISA that intends that a... indicates an intent that a corporate plan sponsor, which, of course, is a person under section (3)(9) of ERISA, that expressly reserved unto itself the right to amend, specify which of its agents should amend.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.435" offset="1248505">Of course, a corporate plan sponsor, being a corporation and a juridical entity, not a... a legal entity rather than a physical entity, can only act through--</text>

            <text syncTime="318.144" offset="1419242">In many cases, there might, indeed, be a need for a procedure for identifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.489" offset="1444633">I would suggest that, since the end result that is obviously intended by Congress is that there be an identification, if the situation is a simple one such as here, it should be sufficient to identify the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.194" offset="1539509">There should not need to be a procedure merely for saying that the plan sponsor will set forth a procedure for identifying itself as a plan sponsor.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.421" offset="1584440">It would seem superfluous to utter those words as an incantation when the purpose--</text>

            <text syncTime="375.063" offset="1646925">As applied in this case with a single employer voluntary welfare benefit plan, is the identification of the person who has the authority to amend just surplusage?</text>

            <text syncTime="1660.378" offset="6788241">It would be far more natural, in our view, to recognize the effectiveness of the amendment if the person identified has clearly manifested its or his intention to change the plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="1703.595" offset="6961067">It would be inconsistent, we believe, with Congress' intent that beneficiaries and participants be able to rely on the terms of the document as written to invalidate the plan under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.724" offset="7013625">That leaves, of course, the question of whether ERISA itself prohibits amendments in the absence of a plan procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1726.531" offset="7052809">The harm caused by the failure to have a procedure is the failure to provide guidance to the fiduciaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.713" offset="7069527">The fiduciaries will, in the ordinary course, simply go to the employer in that kind of a circumstance and request further guidance, more detailed procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.509" offset="7104741">In the unlikely event that the corporation or sponsor were to refuse, ERISA provides a tailored remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.014" offset="7130758">Under section 502(a)(3), the fiduciary can enjoin the employer to provide a more specific procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.008" offset="7158762">Because ERISA provides that remedy, it need not be read to provide a remedy of invalidation, or to require a procedure for amendment as a condition precedent to amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.825" offset="7209962">We agree with petitioner that the act cannot honestly be read... that 402(b)(3) should not be read to provide... to serve as a condition precedent, because there are various other provisions in the act in which Congress has made clear its intention to have a condition precedent when it wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.758" offset="7281746">Finally, we believe that reading 402(b)(3) as a condition precedent is inconsistent with the approach to 402 more generally.</text>

            <text syncTime="3007.763" offset="12177720">The first is that there is a statute of limitations here which would prevent participants from going back more than 6 years to complain of amendments supplied to them that had not been properly adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.062" offset="12226935">Within that 6-year period, since at least 1990, the Third Circuit in the Frank and Hozier cases has made it quite clear that plans that persisted in adopting amendments not pursuant to a 403(b) procedure were at risk of having rendered themselves unamendable, and if a plan sponsor has proceeded to continue to maintain itself out of compliance with ERISA, and is harmed by this, it's a self-inflicted wound in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.578" offset="12337067">There's been ample notice to them that this was a congressional directive, and it was entitled to be respected.</text>

            <text syncTime="3221.123" offset="13031193">In our view, that's inappropriate when the default was not a reporting and disclosure obligation in section 102, but a far more fundamental section directly within the fiduciary sections of ERISA.</text>
