          <turn speaker="irving_l_gornstein" startTime="13.641" stopTime="268.847">
            <label>Mr. Irving L. Gornstein</label>
            <text syncTime="13.641" offset="196809">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.771" offset="205272">This case arises under the vaccine injury act and involves an interpretation of two related provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.645" offset="236828">The first creates a presumption that a vaccine has caused a child's condition when the first symptom or manifestation of the onset of that condition occurs within a specified period after the administration of a vaccine.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.635" offset="296805">The second permits the Secretary to rebut the presumption of causation by showing that the child's condition is due to factors unrelated to the vaccine.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.855" offset="341632">Our position is that the court of appeals erred in its interpretation of each of these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.658" offset="368799">Let me start with the statutory presumption in section 300aa-11, which appears in page 2 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.214" offset="407042">The court of appeals interpreted the requirement that the first symptom or manifestation of onset must occur in the statutory period to mean that a presumption of causation will arise whenever any manifestation of a covered condition occurs after the administration of the vaccine, even if that condition has already manifested itself beforehand.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.922" offset="513935">So under the court of appeals decision, if a child has very clear manifestations of a serious brain injury, and then has the vaccine, and then another manifestation of the same condition, under the court of appeals decision, there will be a presumption that the vaccine caused the onset of the child's condition, and we think that interpretation is incorrect for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.899" offset="621769">First, it is inconsistent with the use of the statutory terms, first, and onset.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.025" offset="650294">When a condition has already manifested itself prior to the administration of a vaccine, any manifestation of that same condition that occurs after the administration of the vaccine cannot be first, and it cannot be a manifestation of onset.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.794" offset="721347">The very first symptom or manifestation of onset necessarily implied the absence of any preexisting symptom or manifestation of that same condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.873" offset="769726">The second reason that we think the court of appeals erred in its interpretation is that its interpretation fails to take into account the fact that Congress specifically addressed cases where conditions had already manifested themselves prior to the administration of a vaccine through the significant aggravation presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.029" offset="858334">Under section 300aa-11, there is a separate presumption of causation when the first symptom or manifestation of a significant aggravation of a preexisting condition occurs within the statutory period.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.608" offset="924685">We think the clear import of that separate presumption is that when a condition has already manifested itself prior to the administration of the vaccine, a presumption that the vaccine has something to do with the child's condition can only arise when that preexisting condition has gotten worse after the administration of the vaccine.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.823" offset="1017472">So under a simple and straightforward reading of the statutory language, the simple existence of a symptom or manifestation of a covered condition in the statutory period is never enough by itself to trigger the presumption that the vaccine has caused the child's condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.758" offset="1097197">In addition, it must either be the case that there's no preexisting symptom or manifestation of that condition, or the child's condition has gotten markedly worse afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.866" offset="1149651">By holding the court of appeals holding that the existence of a symptom or manifestation of a condition in the statutory period was sufficient by itself to trigger the statutory presumption, we think the court of appeals clearly erred.</text>

          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="268.847" stopTime="281.154">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="268.847" offset="1217569">Mr. Gornstein, if we had only the language that was in that table and not the statutory language, wouldn't there be more of a case for the opposite interpretation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="irving_l_gornstein" startTime="281.154" stopTime="383.292">
            <label>Mr. Irving L. Gornstein</label>
            <text syncTime="281.154" offset="1266784">Justice Ginsburg, I think even if we were just looking at that table language, and that appears, by the way, at page 4 of our brief, and says,</text>
            <text syncTime="290.561" offset="1304505">"Time period for first symptom or manifestation of onset or of significant aggravation after vaccine administration. "</text>
            <text syncTime="297.506" offset="1332195">there would be more of a case, but I still think you would come to the same conclusion, because the words "first" are still used in relation to the term "onset" and I think when a condition has manifested itself prior to vaccine administration, anything that comes after that cannot be the first manifestation of onset.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.729" offset="1409099">Even trying to give some meaning to the word "first" in the table period is difficult, given the way the court of appeals interpreted that phrase, because if Congress had set out to do what the court of appeals had done, it wouldn't have needed to use the word "first" at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.071" offset="1486526">It could have just said, any symptom after vaccine administration, because any symptom is always first in relation to what came... comes after the statutory period.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.988" offset="1530203">The only real reason to use the word "first" is to make clear that you're talking about first in relation to what came before the statutory period.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.084" offset="1566565">But whatever ambiguity you have when you just look at this language, I think the bigger problem with what the court of appeals did is that it looked here at all, because the purpose of the Vaccine Injury Table is not to set out what the claimant is required to show in order to trigger the statutory presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.479" offset="1652143">It's set out to show the time period in which the claimant has to make that showing.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="383.292" offset="1675339">Isn't the term "first" somewhat superfluous with the term "onset"?</text>

            <text syncTime="388.414" offset="1695819">Well, I think you have the first symptom or manifestation of onset, or significant aggravation.</text>

            <text syncTime="396.920" offset="1729883">I think it... it does modify onset, yes, but I think it's just first symptom or manifest... it's somewhat superfluous, I would agree, but I think it makes it more clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.677" offset="1768962">It describes a relationship between "first" and "onset".</text>
            <text syncTime="410.410" offset="1783904">So I think that that is the basic mistake, is in looking to the Vaccine Injury Table, because what... under section 300aa-13, it tells you that compensation is appropriate when the petitioner has demonstrated the matters in 300aa-11, and 300aa-11 is the part of the statute we're relying on, which is very clear, and I believe even the court of appeals acknowledged that when you look at 300aa-11, it's very clear that the claimant has to show, in effect, the first of all manifestations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3482.597" offset="14072636">Hypothetical number 2, the doctor says, there is in fact a recognized syndrome or condition in which seizures and neck-twisting go together.</text>
