            <text syncTime="64.177" offset="397692">The Double Jeopardy Clause protects against the Government seeking a second punishment for the same offense in a second prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.409" offset="430606">The issue in this case is whether the Government's attempt to punish Mr. Witte for cocaine offenses previously included in relevant conduct violates that protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.139" offset="469581">The facts of this case illustrate exactly what the Double Jeopardy Clause was designed to protect against.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.544" offset="491210">They also illustrate how these Federal Sentencing Guidelines can be defeated and eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.963" offset="516915">Mr. Witte was sentenced to 12 years in Federal prison after buying 375 pounds of marijuana from Federal agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.616" offset="547426">That sentence was based upon two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.067" offset="557248">It was based upon a guideline range of 292 to 365 months, which included all prior marijuana offenses and all prior cocaine offenses negotiated or committed by Mr. Witte.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.735" offset="603955">It was further based upon Mr. Witte's cooperation and a Government request to reduce his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.342" offset="630391">The Government has now indicted Mr. Witte for the same cocaine offenses and seeks to punish him again.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.029" offset="653169">The express language of the sentencing guidelines shows that Mr. Witte was previously punished, and that he will be punished again.</text>

            <text syncTime="169.843" offset="820353">The reason the claim is ripe is because under the Federal Drug Guideline and the other language of the guidelines, all offenses were merged for purposes of punishment in the first prosecution, and Mr. Witte has received all punishment that he can receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.197" offset="881793">The Government is barred from the end... obtaining the end of the second prosecution... that is, any further punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="206.391" offset="966534">I was troubled by it, and I wondered how you would deal with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.218" offset="981894">I also am troubled by how you would distinguish that case of Williams v. Oklahoma, where we held that the use of evidence of an uncharged crime at sentencing for the crime for which the prosecution succeeded, doesn't constitute punishment for the uncharged conduct, and it seemed to me quite close.</text>

            <text syncTime="243.235" offset="1113969">In Williams v. Oklahoma, this Court sought in vain for a cross-reference between the murder statute and the kidnapping statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.624" offset="1143540">Finding no cross-reference... that is, no merger of the two crimes for purposes of prosecution, no merger of the two crimes for purposes of punishment, it found no violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause and said, well, this is just a mere enhancement.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.448" offset="1198815">In this case, the Federal Drug Guideline 2D1.1 and the policy decisions made by the Commission effect a merger for purposes of punishment, and that is exactly where the violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause--</text>

            <text syncTime="291.219" offset="1305917">I infer from the Court's seeking a cross-reference between the two statutes that it was looking for some sort of merger that would prohibit either the second prosecution or the second punishment, or it would not have sought some cross-reference between the two statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.572" offset="1527331">2D1.1 and the grouping provisions state, group the offenses, drug offenses, according to their weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.100" offset="1565365">The guidelines also say drug offenses present a fungible harm and therefore ought to be grouped.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.315" offset="1598280">So what happens is, the drug offenses, we arrive at a guideline by grouping them, by getting a total weight of the drugs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2274.068" offset="9237320">One is an argument based on the Constitution, that what we are doing violates double jeopardy per se and that, we think, is wrong for all the reasons that we've been discussing, that all these Court's cases are to the contrary on both sentencing and due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.517" offset="9291132">Now, there is also a statutory argument, I suppose, that could be made, that Congress intended when it passes... passed the guidelines and the Sentencing Reform Act to so transform the sentencing system that it would in effect forbid, as a matter of statutory law, subsequent prosecution and successive prosecutions of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.040" offset="9361140">Now, we think that that cannot hold up, first of all because there is no positive indication anywhere in the language or the history of the Sentencing Reform Act or the guidelines to suggest that that's what Congress had in mind, and second because the guidelines themselves in section 5G1.3 have an explicit mechanism which is designed to take care of exactly this kind of situation, where you have successive prosecutions for the same kind of conduct, in fact, the same exact conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.327" offset="9470332">Now, it is implausible that Congress addressed, then the Sentencing Commission addressed that issue specifically in 5G1.2 if they thought that it was unconstitutional anyway, given what they had done to the definition of offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.118" offset="9521532">To return for a moment to the issue of what you are punished for when you are punished, no matter what is being taken into account, I'd like to just point out one example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.269" offset="9574090">The amount of marijuana involved in the first prosecution here happened to be 370 pounds, and that put Mr. Witte in the statutory sentencing category of 5 to 40 years, a very broad category which, as I mentioned, accommodated any of the possible changes in the guidelines range depending on the relevant conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.901" offset="9648592">But supposing it had been 50 kilograms of marijuana, then his statutory maximum sentence under section 841, leaving aside unlikely other events, would have been 5 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.944" offset="9696761">Now, suppose that the guidelines range, as it would have been, would have been 33 to 41 months, in the middle of that 5-year range, and suppose the district court had taken account of the other 232,000 kilograms of marijuana equivalent that it took account of in this case as relevant conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.859" offset="9764471">It would have wanted... it would have been required to enhance his sentence, but it would have hit a statutory maximum of 5 years, and it would have been able to impose no sentence greater than 5 years, because that's the statutory maximum for the offense of conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2659.954" offset="10780843">But until the legislature does that, and there's no case that has ever held that the legislature has done that, until they do that, what the legislature decides is an offense element and a sentencing factor controls, and if it's a sentencing factor, it need only be proved by a preponderance, although of course Congress could prescribe something greater, and it does not go to the question of whether you've been punished for that conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.164" offset="10865689">You've only had that conduct taken into account in enhancing your punishment for something else, of which you have been duly convicted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2908.049" offset="11773183">Let me point out first that the Government says that it has always had the opportunity to bring separate charges and obtain different punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.811" offset="11820307">The Sentencing Reform Act and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines changed that system because of the disproportionate sentences that came about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.367" offset="11862521">It changed that system because Congress wanted uniformity and honesty in sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.351" offset="11882374">The fact that the Government cannot now bring subsequent prosecutions to try to get different sentences is something that Congress wanted to bring about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.860" offset="11932425">Now, let me say a few words about the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.439" offset="11942769">The record in this case show... shows that number 1, the Government filed a criminal complaint alleging all acts and all offenses at the outset of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2984.815" offset="12080278">The Government, in the motion to dismiss hearing in this case, when questioned by the judge about a Castlebaugh problem said, oh, no, judge, we had all the evidence before Mr. Witte pleaded guilty in the first case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.702" offset="12127821">So they had all the evidence to prosecute him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.185" offset="12137747">They could have filed an indictment then, and could have gotten their conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.824" offset="12152272">If there was a problem finding Mr. Parkorny, they had plenty of tools in their arsenal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.244" offset="12170035">They can get a continuance under the Speedy Trial Act to try to apprehend fugitives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.445" offset="12190828">They can try the cases separately and merge them for sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.599" offset="12207442">The Government is not precluded by getting another conviction at the same time when it alleged all those facts at the outset of the first prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.144" offset="12241610">Finally, I'd like to point out the Government cannot cite a reason for pursuing this prosecution that puts Mr. Witte, according to the Fifth Circuit's opinion, in jeopardy for an additional 118 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.106" offset="12297408">I think the Court can only infer that the reason it's going after this is to get a second bite at an apple, to get additional punishment, which is exactly what the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.679" offset="12343697">Your Honors, we request that you reverse the decision of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and remand for dismissal of the indictment in this case.</text>
