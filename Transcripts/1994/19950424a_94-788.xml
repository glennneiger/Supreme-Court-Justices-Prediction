            <text syncTime="10.528" offset="183087">Mr. Strauss.</text>

          <turn speaker="david_a_strauss" startTime="75.831" stopTime="274.441">
            <label>Mr. David A. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="75.831" offset="444207">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="78.994" offset="456851">The question in this case is whether a district court in an admiralty collision case may in the exercise of its discretion withhold prejudgment interests on the ground that the plaintiff was the party predominantly at fault, and that the defendant, throughout much of the litigation, had reason to believe it would not be held liable at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.566" offset="535218">The collision involved in this case occurred on Christmas Eve, 1979, when a storm blew up in Lake Michigan near Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.511" offset="570954">A ship called the EM FORD, loaded with cement, broke away from its mooring, crashed into its berth, took on water, and sunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.376" offset="606480">The respondents are the owners and insurers of the ship, and they sued in admiralty for $6.5 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.553" offset="635110">They claim that the city was negligent in not warning of the danger of storms.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.595" offset="655277">The city denied negligence and said that the accident had been caused by the negligence of the ship's master in leaving the ship essentially unattended in its berth, without any means to monitor the weather or to call for help.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.484" offset="706895">The city also counterclaimed for a quarter of a million dollars in damage to its dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.997" offset="728942">The suit didn't come to trial until 1986, at which point the issue of liability was tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.292" offset="754124">The district court decided the liability issue in 1989, and it ruled at that point that the respondents were almost entirely at fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.557" offset="787143">Specifically, the city was liable for only 4 percent of the damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.738" offset="803861">That ruling of the district court, 10 years after the accident, was reversed by the Seventh Circuit a year later.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.756" offset="835940">The Seventh Circuit held that the district court had inadequately explained its apportionment of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.990" offset="860913">Instead of remanding, however, the Seventh Circuit itself reapportioned the liability, still assigning the bulk of the share to respondents, two-thirds to respondents, one-third to the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.704" offset="899783">At that point, the parties entered into a settlement agreement on the liability issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.639" offset="919531">The city agreed to pay $1.67 million, compared to the $6.5 million initially sought, to the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.234" offset="953909">The parties further agreed in this settlement that the district court would determine whether prejudgment interest was to be awarded, and if so, in what amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.161" offset="989540">The district court then denied the respondents' request for $5.3 million in prejudgment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.104" offset="1017334">The district court recognized, and it is common ground here, that in admiralty the presumption is in favor of awarding prejudgment interest, but the district court denied prejudgment interest in this case on the ground that the plaintiff was far more at fault than the city, and that throughout most of the litigation, nearly all of the litigation, there was a good chance that the city would not be held liable in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.529" offset="1111061">The Seventh Circuit again reversed, holding that the district court may never exercise discretion to withhold prejudgment interest on the grounds that the plaintiff was at fault, and this Court then granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.168" offset="1165605">Now, there is no general Federal prejudgment interest statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.940" offset="1184727">Instead, judge-made rules govern prejudgment interest in Federal courts in admiralty, and in cases arising under Federal statutes that are silent on the matter of prejudgment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.560" offset="1227149">The one constant in these--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="274.441" offset="1238643">Are you saying there's no Federal statute governing prejudgment interest, period, or prejudgment interest in admiralty cases?</text>

            <label>Mr. David A. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="281.024" offset="1264975">--There is no Federal statute governing prejudgment interest in admiralty cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.339" offset="1286291">There's also no umbrella Federal statute, as there is for postjudgment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.941" offset="1304681">There are prejudgment interest provisions in certain specific Federal programmatic statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.583" offset="1323280">In the judge-made cases that govern admiralty and also the Federal statutes that are silent on prejudgment interests, the one constant has been that an award of prejudgment interest is by no means automatic, as this Court said in its most recent such case.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.953" offset="1384720">Rather, the trial court has discretion in deciding whether to award prejudgment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.738" offset="1407917">Here, the district court exercised its discretion, and withheld prejudgment interest because two factors coalesced.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.684" offset="1439682">First, for the first 11 years of the 13-year litigation, the city had every reason to think that it would be subject to no significant liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.050" offset="1481164">The suit was initially brought by a ship that had broken loose from its mooring.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.638" offset="1519512">The city did not moor the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.257" offset="1525990">The claim was only negligent failure to warn.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.459" offset="1538738">When the district court decided the liability issue, the district court reapportioned the liability on a 96 to 4 basis, holding the city only 4 percent at fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.566" offset="1579176">Even after the court of appeals reversed, the plaintiffs were still the party predominantly at fault by a ratio of 2 to 1, and that was the second factor that influenced the district court's exercise of its discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="396.189" offset="1725670">You leap to the conclusion from the fact that the district court gave a 96-4 break that all during the period up until then the city thought it would have negligible liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.087" offset="1769242">I don't know why that follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.177" offset="1773631">Certainly it's reasonable to say that from the time of the district court decision until the time of the court of appeals decision the city thought, what the heck, I'm not... the interest won't amount to anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.946" offset="1816681">It's only for that 1 year.</text>

            <text syncTime="420.966" offset="1824831">--Well, Justice Scalia, I think that's quintessentially the kind of issue that the district court is in a position to resolve, and were the district court to say, in the exercise of its discretion, you should have known all along that you might be held substantially liable, the district court could exercise its discretion and award prejudgment interest in some amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.767" offset="1892018">But the district court here reached the opposite conclusion, and all we're contending for is that the district court should be able to exercise its discretion in that regard.</text>

            <text syncTime="599.594" offset="2539332">The other factor, as I said, that influenced the district court was just, as this Court has said in its prejudgment cases, the relative equities of the parties, a factor that this Court has frequently said should play a role in deciding the award of prejudgment interest, and the district court was influenced by the fact that the plaintiffs were not only at fault but predominantly at fault.</text>

            <text syncTime="1479.790" offset="6060116">We lay out many reasons in our brief, including the one I mentioned to Justice Souter, the cases that were cited, that we cited in our brief that the divided damages rule wasn't in play and nonetheless this mutual fault approach to prejudgment interest was applied, but I suppose the best way to explain the weakness of the court of appeals reasoning is that this... denying prejudgment interest is a very crude way of dealing with the supposed inequities of the divided damages rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.870" offset="6188429">When lower courts wanted to deal with those... with the perceived harshness of that rule, what they did was to design rules to deal with it, the so-called major-minor fault rule, that when a party was only somewhat at fault they would not divide damages, and the so-called in extremis rule, which operated to somewhat the same effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1569.499" offset="6418934">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.782" offset="6440041">I'd like to go directly to a couple of questions asked here, because I've lived with this case since that ship went down and I saw it the next morning, and I know some of the answers and I don't think Mr. Strauss does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.351" offset="6490300">First of all, in personal injury cases as well as in all admiralty cases, prejudgment interest is the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.959" offset="6532723">As a matter of fact, Anderson v. Whittaker, which is cited in our brief, out of the Sixth Circuit, which disagrees with the Fifth Circuit, holds that prejudgment interest in a personal injury case is the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.179" offset="6593641">All admiralty courts in all circuits, including the Fifth and the Eleventh, hold that prejudgment interest is to be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.955" offset="6632720">Now, whether you want to talk about it in terms of a court has the discretion to award it, or it is the rule and the court has discretion to deny an award of prejudgment interest, the measure is still the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.422" offset="6682666">Did the court abuse its discretion by denying prejudgment interest?</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.587" offset="6707326">The reason we're here is because the Ninth, Sixth, and Seventh Circuits hold that the exception to awarding prejudgment interest is special circumstances, and all courts agree on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.682" offset="6791649">The Ninth, Sixth, and Seventh Circuits hold that mutual fault, or if you want to call it magnitude of fault, or if you want to call it genuine dispute in a mutual fault situation, they are not special circumstances, and they do not justify by themselves a denial of prejudgment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.655" offset="6883496">The Third and Eighth Circuits have not ruled on the question, but have given indication in cases that they probably are going to go along with the Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth in that line of reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.227" offset="6953817">District courts in the First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Eighth Circuits have held that mutual fault is not a special circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.924" offset="7000629">The Fifth Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit, which generally goes along with it, have held that it is a special circumstance, and a judge may exercise his discretion to deny prejudgment interest if he wants to because of mutual fault, and that's why we're here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.173" offset="7101670">There's a split in the circuits on this, and the majority rule is what I'm espousing, and the minority rule is what Mr. Strauss is espousing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.059" offset="7137197">It seems to me that this is a relatively simple thing, although nothing is ever simple, I guess, in life, but the underlying philosophy for the award of a prejudgment interest is that it is a part of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.217" offset="7201771">It is compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.058" offset="7209190">It serves to compensate for the loss of the use of money as damages from the time of the... when the cause of action arose until the time of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.526" offset="7250986">In admiralty, which is a separate body of law, and I think this Court recognizes that because in Miles v. Apex Marine, where the Court spoke through Justice O'Connor, it very clearly talked about admiralty as a separate regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.440" offset="7342728">It has some statutory things that apply to it, but by and large it is a judge-made law, and has been since the beginning of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.156" offset="7377523">Certainly, there are the Death on the High Seas Act, the Longshore &amp; Harbor Workers Compensation Act, the Jones Act, the rules of the road and those kind of things, but by and large the law in admiralty in this country has been case law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3321.136" offset="13425497">There is a certain coherence to the idea that we should have a nondiscretionary regime in which prejudgment interest is simply awarded as a matter of course no matter what, in order to make the plaintiff whole and take away any windfall from the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.057" offset="13493102">There's a certain coherence to that regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.740" offset="13499894">Of course, that regime would require upsetting literally a century of precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.802" offset="13520165">If we are not going to have that regime, if we are going to have a discretionary regime, then our submission is that a case in which one party pursued the litigation in a reasonable fashion, or at least so the district court apparently thought, and that party was much less at fault than the other, is an appropriate one in which to exercise discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.965" offset="13604802">We're not saying that in all such cases prejudgment interest must be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.107" offset="13621311">We're not saying that remotely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.489" offset="13626849">What we are saying is that in those cases where the defendant is much less at fault than the plaintiff, and the defendant had reason to think it would not be liable at all, the district court, if there is to be discretion... if there is to be discretion... that is an appropriate case in which the district court should be allowed discretion.</text>
