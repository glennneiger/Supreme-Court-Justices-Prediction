            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="145973">We'll hear argument this morning in Number 93-1504, the Celotex Corporation v. Bennie Edwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.856" offset="181395">Mr. Warren.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_w_warren" startTime="10.372" stopTime="162.337">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey W. Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="10.372" offset="187455">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.891" offset="197486">At issue in this case is whether the bankruptcy court presiding over the Celotex Chapter 11 case had jurisdiction to enter an interim stay of execution on supersedeas bonds by judgment creditors of Celotex.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.465" offset="247746">That stay restrained the Edwardses from collecting their judgment against Celotex, which was largely for punitive damages from Northbrook, the surety on the supersedeas bond posted for the benefit of Celotex, for the benefit of the Edwardses.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.391" offset="307514">The case arises out of the Edwards' admitted collateral attack on the bankruptcy court stay order when they requested under Rule 65.1 that the district court in Texas which had originally presided over their personal injury claim against Celotex granted them permission to enforce the supersedeas bond against Northbrook notwithstanding the bankruptcy court's stay order.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.555" offset="396122">At the time Celotex filed its bankruptcy petition it had posted similar supersedeas bonds in over 100 separate appeals using 70 million dollars of assets to secure its obligations to the sureties.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.446" offset="443664">Celotex was defending over 100,000 personal injury and wrongful death cases, all of which were the result of the same conduct by a predecessor that had merged into Celotex, which was the same basis for the claims of the Edwardses.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.789" offset="497059">These cases arise from exposure to asbestos-containing products.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.574" offset="512210">They were manufactured by Philip Carey Corporation, a corporation that was merged into Celotex in the early 1970's.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.812" offset="541153">Over the objections of Celotex and Northbrook, the Texas district court granted the Edwards' request for permission to ignore the bankruptcy court's stay order.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.417" offset="575635">The Fifth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.285" offset="583054">A similar attempted collateral attack by the same plaintiffs' counsel was rejected by the Fourth Circuit when it reversed a Virginia district court order that had granted permission to ignore the bankruptcy court's stay order.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.677" offset="628611">The Fourth Circuit directed that the judgment creditor had to seek direct from the bankruptcy court.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.497" offset="651913">In response to the improper collateral attack arguments raised by Celotex, the Edwardses concede that the judgment of the Fifth Circuit must be reversed if the bankruptcy court had subject matter jurisdiction to issue its interim stay of the execution upon Celotex' supersedeas bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.524" offset="716069">That's the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.042" offset="726100">The statutory basis of the bankruptcy court's subject matter jurisdiction is 28 U.S.C. section 1334(b), which states that the district courts have jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title 11 or arising in or related to cases under title 11.</text>

            <text syncTime="172.276" offset="834979">What are the ways in which it will?</text>
            <text syncTime="174.728" offset="844801">The money Northbrook has to pay is outside the bankruptcy estate, of course, so how will it affect the bankruptcy estate?</text>

            <text syncTime="183.501" offset="879909">Justice O'Connor, the way it affects the estate is that Celotex has a contractual relationship with Northbrook that was entered into as part of the posting of the supersedeas bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.356" offset="919302">To secure that contractual relationship, Celotex, under a settlement agreement that resolved certain insurance coverage disputes with Northbrook, pledged that if Northbrook had to pay a bond it could exercise rights of set-off against the funds that would otherwise be available to Celotex for payment to its creditors, so that although under the--</text>

            <text syncTime="220.459" offset="1027762">The money that Northbrook would pay to the Edwardses is not subject to the property of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.946" offset="1053676">The property pledged by Celotex to Northbrook is property of the estate, and it's that interconnection that creates the effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="250.760" offset="1148971">There are two bases upon which Celotex for the benefit of its estate is presently prosecuting adversary proceedings in the bankruptcy court to bring back into, to recover for the benefit of all of its creditors, those funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.353" offset="1203305">The first premise is, is that the vast majority of the Edwards' claim is for punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.839" offset="1229323">245,000 dollars of their claim is for punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.910" offset="1245519">Under the principles of equitable subordination codified in section 510(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, Celotex is seeking, through the bankruptcy court, to subordinate those claims, which would then invalidate and bring back to the estate those funds that were transferred to Northbrook.</text>

            <text syncTime="303.061" offset="1358159">--That's correct, but it is a judgment for punitive awards which under normal bankruptcy practice would not be recoverable in lieu of the ability to compensate regular compensatory awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.820" offset="1417196">The invalidity of the claim... the obligation of Northbrook on the judgment to the Edwardses is predicated upon the affirmance by the Fifth Circuit of that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.061" offset="1470172">The Bankruptcy Code expressly permits a basis upon which equitable subordination can occur, so that one creditor cannot recover for its benefit claims to the detriment of other creditors if the bankruptcy court finds appropriate grounds for that to occur.</text>

            <text syncTime="373.454" offset="1639759">Northbrook would not stand as a surety for Celotex but for the existence of adequate collateral.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.919" offset="1745607">The area of fraudulent transfers is what is applicable in connection with the Edwards' claim because it is outside the 90-day preference period.</text>
