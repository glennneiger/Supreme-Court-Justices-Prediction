            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="86876">I have the opinion of the Court in two cases to announce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4.851" offset="106207">The first is number 93-1543 Mckennon versus Nashville Banner Publishing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.164" offset="139434">This case arises under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.072" offset="159078">An employee who in violation of the Act is discharged because of age discrimination has a cause of action against the employer, and for some 30-years petitioner Christen McKennon worked for respondent Nashville Banner Publishing Co.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.629" offset="229296">When she was 62-years-old the Banner discharged her, the Banner said, her discharge was part of a workforce reduction plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.949" offset="266598">McKennon thought that her age was the reason for dismissal and she filed suit under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.786" offset="290004">The Banner took McKennon’s deposition and discovered that Mckennon had copied confidential financial records and had removed them from the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.602" offset="329188">The employer claimed this misconduct would have resulted in her immediate termination had it been discovered earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.542" offset="365028">The Banner claimed that McKennon’s misconduct was sufficient to bar her from all relief under the Act and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit agreed with that possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.942" offset="410585">In an opinion authored by Justice Kennedy we reverse the Sixth Circuit because we think that a violation of the Act can’t be totally disregarded that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.759" offset="453844">We hold that the beginning point in the trial court’s formulation of a remedy should be calculation of back pay from the date of the unlawful discharge to the date the new information was discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.681" offset="505567">In determining the appropriate order for relief the Court consider taking into further account equitable circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.114" offset="539317">An absolute rule baring recovery of back pay however we think undermines the objectives of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.737" offset="569723">But we do decide that in this case as a general rule in cases of this type neither reinstatement nor front pay that is future wages is an appropriate remedy for a conduct or misconduct would have resulted in terminations and the opinion is unanimous.</text>
