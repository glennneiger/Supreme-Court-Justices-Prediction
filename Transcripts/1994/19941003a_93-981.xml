            <text syncTime="9.294" offset="168128">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="13.355" offset="184428">This case concerns the Federal drug conspiracy statute which is codified as section 846, title 21 of the U.S. Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.273" offset="224030">Respondent was indicted by a Federal grand jury in the District of Alaska on one count of violating section 846 by conspiring to distribute cocaine in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.737" offset="269901">The indictment did not allege that respondent or any of his coconspirators committed any overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.468" offset="304905">Respondent moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the Government is required, in a prosecution under 846, to allege and prove an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.151" offset="355583">The district court denied that motion, and subsequently, at the close of the evidence at trial, the court denied respondent's request to instruct the jury that the Government was required to prove an overt act.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.378" offset="408454">The jury found respondent guilty, but the Ninth Circuit reversed his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.111" offset="431442">It held that the Government is required by section 846 to prove that an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.373" offset="464461">That holding conflicts with the holdings of all eleven other regional courts of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.808" offset="490165">The Government brought the case here on a writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.807" offset="502182">The question presented is whether section 846 requires proof of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.790" offset="534156">In our view, the answer to that question is no, section 846 does not require such proof, for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.878" offset="562472">First, the text of section 846 does not expressly require proof of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy, and in contrast, many other Federal conspiracy statutes, including the general conspiracy statute, do expressly require such proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.731" offset="633943">In light of the many Federal statutes that set forth the requirement expressly, section 846 cannot be construed to impose the requirement by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.837" offset="674381">Second, in United States v. Singer, this Court upheld the conviction under a conspiracy statute that the Court construed not to require proof of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.722" offset="729865">Singer in an earlier decision--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="151.517" offset="737075">Mr. Seamon, in the Felix case, I guess Justice Stevens in his separate concurrence argued that the overt acts didn't establish an essential element of the conspiracy, and the majority opinion did not seem to accept that view as expressed by Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.180" offset="831743">Is that something we're going to have to explain if we agree with you on this interpretation?</text>

            <text syncTime="183.334" offset="864343">The majority opinion in Felix simply didn't address this question of statutory interpretation presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.845" offset="894332">Felix was a Double Jeopardy case, and both courts agreed in this Court that section 846 doesn't require proof of an overt act, and the case was litigated in this Court on that assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.418" offset="948667">Furthermore, the court of appeals in Felix, even though it decided the Double Jeopardy issue against us, also recognized that section 846 doesn't require proof of an overt act, therefore the majority's opinion in Felix was directed at explaining why, although a broad reading of Grady might have barred the prosecution, it was rejecting that broad reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.954" offset="1054828">The decisions of this Court that do control here are Nash and Singer.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.107" offset="1083458">Those decisions not only construe a conspiracy statute that is silent on the question not to require proof of an overt act, but they apply a rule of statutory interpretation that fully applies here.</text>

            <text syncTime="267.892" offset="1202577">In other words, the overt act requirement in a case such as this is not difficult to show, it was in fact shown, and yet the prosecutor resisted the charge?</text>

            <text syncTime="280.028" offset="1251060">It is correct that overt acts were proven in this case, and that as a general matter they won't be difficult to prove in a conspiracy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.869" offset="1286482">In the... the prosecutor examined the state of the law and concluded that proof of an overt act wasn't an essential element of the crime and therefore didn't have to be alleged in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.395" offset="1332562">As a matter of fact, it was actually the district court that first raised the question of whether an overt act needed to be alleged, and it determined that one didn't need to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.562" offset="1377179">Therefore, the district court submitted the case to the jury without instructing it that it was required to prove an overt act.</text>

            <text syncTime="467.358" offset="2000461">The... and our primary argument is based on the text of section 846, which... and Congress' intent in enacting that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.105" offset="2043406">The text of section 846 is set out in relevant part on page 9 of our opening brief on the merits, and page 9 also sets out the general conspiracy statute with which it is useful to compare section 846.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.990" offset="2098890">Section 846 is at the top of page 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.801" offset="2114146">It does not expressly require proof of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.096" offset="2131387">It punishes</text>
            <text syncTime="501.236" offset="2135880">"any person who conspires to commit any offense. "</text>
            <text syncTime="505.157" offset="2151658">defined in the subchapter proscribing various drug offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.216" offset="2167854">In contrast, the general conspiracy statute, which is at the bottom of page 9 of our brief, does expressly require proof of an overt act.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.837" offset="2202335">It makes it illegal, in relevant part,</text>
            <text syncTime="520.727" offset="2213934">"If two or more persons conspire to commit any offense against the United States and do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy. "</text>
            <text syncTime="529.724" offset="2249878">That language in the general conspiracy statute, referring to an act to effect the object of the conspiracy, shows that Congress understood that an act in furtherance of the conspiracy is separate and distinct from the conspiracy itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.234" offset="2307870">Thus, under the general conspiracy statute, the overt act requirement is not implicit in the term "conspires".</text>
            <text syncTime="551.496" offset="2336918">It is spelled out in separate language that specifically refers to the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.041" offset="2355099">The term 846, and there, too, the term should not be construed to contain an overt act by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.772" offset="2394074">Such a construction would be especially unjustified in light of the fact that there are other Federal conspiracy statutes in which Congress used express language to require proof of an overt act.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.237" offset="2435974">The construction of section 846 that we're urging also is compelled, I think, by the Court's decisions in Nash and Singer.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.641" offset="2465545">In both Nash and Singer, the defendant was charged with a conspiracy under an indictment that did not allege any overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.823" offset="2502325">In both cases, the defendant argued in this Court that the indictment was defective because of its failure to allege an overt act and, in each case, this Court rejected the argument because the statute under which the defendant was charged did not expressly require proof of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.815" offset="2578290">The Court explained that because the statute was silent as to overt acts, it punished conspiracies "on the common law footing", which is to say, without requiring proof of an overt act.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.405" offset="2628654">Nash and Singer provide guidance here in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.465" offset="2644850">They give guidance to the court in interpreting conspiracy statutes that are silent as to overt acts, and they give guidance to Congress by providing a blueprint for it to follow when drafting a conspiracy statute, because they make it clear that if Congress wants to require proof of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy, it has to say so expressly.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.395" offset="2728546">If it does not, the statute will be construed not to require such proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.236" offset="2747876">And it's reasonable to assume that Congress followed the blueprint laid out in Nash and Singer, because Nash and Singer were on the books both when Congress enacted the earliest drug conspiracy statute and when it enacted section 846, and their validity has never been called into question by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.462" offset="2824781">Nash and Singer support our position in another way.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.398" offset="2836588">They apply a rule of statutory interpretation that applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.553" offset="2853202">The rule is that, when Congress uses a common law term, the Court presumes, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that Congress intended the term to have its common law meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.363" offset="2896461">At common law, as the Court said in Nash and Singer, proof of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy was not necessary to establish the conspiracy, and there is no evidence that Congress intended to depart from the common law in punishing drug conspiracies.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.557" offset="2961245">Now, respondent questions whether Nash and Singer understood the common law of conspiracy correctly, but in a sense, the question is beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.523" offset="2997085">The point is that Nash and Singer were on the books when Congress enacted the Federal drug conspiracy statutes, and their understanding of the common law had not been called into question up to that point, or for that matter at any point later, for example, when Congress enacted section 846 in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.938" offset="3066779">Thus, Nash and Singer furnish the background rule for Congress in drafting the conspiracy statutes, and they should also apply the background rule for interpreting the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.169" offset="3107635">Respondent's other argument is that Nash and Singer represented, to use his term, an illadvised expansion of conspiracy law, but Nash and Singer didn't break any new ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.398" offset="3152565">Each began with the recognition that at common law it was not necessary to prove an overt act, and that principle had been recognized by this Court as early as 1879 in United States v. Hirsch, and it was reaffirmed in a decision that was issued just a few months before Congress enacted the first Federal drug conspiracy statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.843" offset="3230306">Based on their understanding of the common law, Nash and Singer applied the rule of statutory interpretation concerning Congress' use of a common law term.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.808" offset="3266250">That rule, likewise, had been applied in many earlier and later decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.587" offset="3285372">In short, this Court has never disavowed Nash or Singer or the principles underlying them, and so respondent cannot bear his burden of explaining why the Court should not follow Nash and Singer in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.833" offset="3330303">If there are no questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dennis P. Riordan</label>
            <text syncTime="808.486" offset="3364889">Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="815.249" offset="3391952">Both parties to this action agree that, if possible, the meaning of this statute should be settled on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.152" offset="3423612">Both parties agree that in this case it cannot be settled by simple reference to the text of the statute without reference to any other historical statutory or precedential source, and the reason for that is that it contains the term conspire, and conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.457" offset="3496859">If Congress had said... instead of using the term conspire had used the word agree, if you agree to commit a crime, we wouldn't be here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.766" offset="3534058">We all agree that the term agree has a common meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.514" offset="3549000">It means a meeting of the minds.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.248" offset="3556001">We all agree that a meeting of the minds doesn't require or imply further action.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.511" offset="3577003">People agree with their doctors every day to stop smoking, and further action is neither necessary to that term nor, as we know, frequently none follows, but in this case they use conspire and conspiracy, and both parties agree that there is probably no term in the criminal law less... less capable of easy analysis or common understanding than the terms conspire and conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.499" offset="3692987">In an article relied on by both parties, by Benjamin Pollack, Professor Pollack stated that the crime of conspiracy</text>
            <text syncTime="898.339" offset="3724334">"is the most difficult to define. "</text>
            <text syncTime="900.511" offset="3733006">and it is almost impossible to confine the true law of conspiracy within the bounds of a definite statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.914" offset="3758606">So we are left, then, with the terms, conspire and conspiracy, and the question, what do they mean in 846?</text>
            <text syncTime="914.271" offset="3788072">The legislative history, we both agree, doesn't help us.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.582" offset="3801343">There is no legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.565" offset="3809284">There is no indication anywhere in the statute whether, when Congress used the terms, conspire and conspiracy, it meant by those terms the definition of conspiracy such as in 371, which contains an overt act requirement, or, on the other hand, it meant some different definition.</text>

            <text syncTime="943.055" offset="3903220">We do in this sense we think it helps us, and here's why, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.038" offset="3923178">If 846 was a statute that was intended to define the elements of conspiracy, it was intended to provide a selfcontained definition of conspire and conspiracy, then we would admit that the failure not to include an overt act requirement when it is included in 371 would be very significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.749" offset="4005934">But one thing that's been missed here is that 846 is not a definitional statute, and it's not a conspiracy statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.528" offset="4037072">It's called, "Attempts and Conspiracies".</text>
            <text syncTime="979.792" offset="4050133">That's the title of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.603" offset="4053372">It deals with two crimes, not one, attempt and conspiracy, and its function is not to define either attempt or conspiracy, but to set the punishment for attempts and conspiracies.</text>

            <text syncTime="992.286" offset="4100079">But at least you have in 846 a prohibition against conspiracy which says nothing about an overt act, and you have in 371 a prohibition against conspiracy which does require an overt act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1005.155" offset="4151592">Absolutely, Your Honor, and if, as I say, 846 was intended to be definitional, to contain... if we could discern from it an intent by Congress to state the elements of conspiracy, then that argument would be persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.042" offset="4203106">But the Federal courts have looked at... for an example, the attempt portion of this, it says that the punishment for attempts and for conspiracies shall be the same as for the substantive offense either attempted or which was the object of conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.752" offset="4266009">The Federal courts have confronted the issue of what attempt means, and in a long line of cases they have said, there is no definition of attempt in 846.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.733" offset="4305924">We have to look elsewhere for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.468" offset="4312820">The Eighth Circuit in the Joyce case, the Fifth Circuit in the Monduhano case said, we can't discern what attempt means from looking at 846, so therefore we have to go to the Model Penal Code, to a Learned Hand opinion in 1951, and in the Joyce case to a 1901 Oliver Wendell Holmes opinion written when he was on the Massachusetts State courts, to find out what attempt means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.348" offset="4408324">If Congress did not, and it certainly did not, provide the elements of attempt, or a definition of attempt, in 846, then we can't assume that it provided a definition of conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.110" offset="4451374">What we can assume is it inserted the words attempt and conspiracy knowing that the definition of those terms would be located elsewhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="1095.650" offset="4513545">--No, we don't, Your Honor, and here's why, because again, in the sources that we've cited, the Pollack article, the Sayre article, the Harno article, the definitive studies of the common law, there's a consensus that over 800 years of English history, and it hardly should come as a surprise, that conspiracy meant different things at different times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.657" offset="4601630">What the Government has done is said that the term, the meaning of the common law definition of conspiracy, is fixed by the 1611 Poulterers' case, and the Poulterers' case was not even before a common law court, it was before the Star Chamber, which was not... I'm no legal historian, but it was not a common law court, it was a prerogative court, a court of the king.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.976" offset="4690864">And to suggest that when Congress in 1970 looked for a common law definition, if that's what it was going to do, it looked to a decision of the Star Chamber, when this country was founded on a rejection of Star Chamber precedent, that Andrew Hamilton thundered against application of the Star Chamber precedents in his defense of John Peter Zanger--</text>

            <text syncTime="2476.159" offset="10035622">--I'm sure that's true, Your Honor, but in Joyce and Monduhano, the Federal court said, look, we don't get any guidance on what the term attempt means from the statute itself, and all we're saying is, we think the same is true of the conspiracy end of the statute, and that the courts have to look elsewhere to figure out what the heck this means, and we think that one reasonable interpretation is that Congress thought that when it uses conspiracy and conspire, it was referring to the kind of offense contained in the general Federal conspiracy statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.910" offset="10162577">Admittedly, that is not... that is not... that's not the only reasonable interpretation of 371.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.815" offset="10182221">The... of 846.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.533" offset="10189117">We concede that the Government's reading of 846 is indeed reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.077" offset="10211269">We could concede that perhaps there's a probability that it's right, but we think there's a very reasonable reading of the statute which suggests that Congress was not focused on deciding that one way or the other, and we have to look elsewhere for the answer to the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2542.193" offset="10299772">I do have a question, actually.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.113" offset="10311475">What do you say in response to Mr. Riordan's argument?</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.800" offset="10326208">That is, I take his argument basically to be that by the time this particular statute was passed, 846, by that time in 1970 it had become fairly widely accepted practice that, in the Federal law, conspiracy included overt acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.543" offset="10397156">Indeed, the only exceptions to that were really criminal provisions that aren't even printed in what we think of as the criminal section of the U.S. Code, 18, 21, 26, et cetera, but rather, sort of outliers, the Sherman Act, which isn't in the West Publishing thing, the Selective Service Act, and so by that time anyone who was a drafter would have thought, of course it includes an overt act when we use that word conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.422" offset="10512722">Indeed, this particular statute doesn't define a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.295" offset="10528187">It seems to refer back to 371.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.575" offset="10545323">It just says, those who commit this kind of offense shall have the same penalties, et cetera, and so at least the matter is ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.744" offset="10577924">After all, a drafter would have looked far and wide for any other normal criminal section with conspiracy if it didn't include overt act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.522" offset="10605091">I mean, that's, I think that's his argument, so that's at least a good enough argument to invoke the Rule of Lenity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2635.874" offset="10674472">Although the Court has focused on 371, the general conspiracy statute which was enacted in 1867, there were many subsequent statutes that expressly require proof of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy in so many words, including a number of statutes that were on the books in 1970 when Congress enacted section 846.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.787" offset="10766110">Those statutes are evidence that the word conspire did not change to include implicitly an overt act element.</text>
