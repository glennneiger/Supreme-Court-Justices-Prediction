            <label>Mr. Robert E. Babcock</label>
            <text syncTime="10.398" offset="169174">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.591" offset="181922">The issue in this case is whether Longshore Act compensation for permanent partial disability stops when economic harm caused by injury ends or whether the benefits must continue in the absence of economic harm until the worker's physical condition improves or fully resolves.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.133" offset="264051">It's an exercise in statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.735" offset="274500">And the starting point must be the central and, we think, undebatable fact that the statute contains no express distinction between physical and other factors in determining the conditions which may serve as grounds for modification.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.828" offset="346807">Any restrictions on modification... this clear, bright line that Respondent Rambo found... finds separating a worker's physical condition from all the other factors and circumstances to collectively determine the economic effects of injury... has to be found outside the statutory language itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.569" offset="425801">We say that it cannot be found within the structure of the Act, the meaning or the context within which the meaning of the word must fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.807" offset="466761">It's simply not a concept suited to a wage loss system.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.540" offset="485674">This bright line, this sharp distinction, would provide benefits to those who have no economic loss, and deny them to those to whom that disability... that economic loss... was delayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.689" offset="546278">When Congress has decided... and they have decided on several occasions... to provide benefits in the absence of economic loss, they've made that intention quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.846" offset="590895">They've used a schedule, which now appears at Sections 8(c)(1) through (20) of the Act... it has been there since its beginning in 1928... or as they did in 1984, they amended and tailored the definition of disability to require focus on impairment in the case of certain retiree cases involving occupational disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.482" offset="677412">And they did that because, in that instance, the retirement was thought by the Benefits Review Board and some courts to have foreclosed the prospect of economic loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.027" offset="715656">We see in the legislative history nothing that demonstrates the presence of an intent to mark between physical and economic factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.176" offset="764243">And we certainly see in the legislative... in... excuse me, in the decisions of this Court no suggestion, particularly in Banks and O'Keefe, that a distinction should occur.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert E. Babcock</label>
            <text syncTime="184.571" offset="865807">--The original determination is made in accordance with some instructions appearing at Section 8(h) of the Act, and includes, in addition to the physical condition, virtually all that would affect either the stability of the current employment or the prospects and stability of future employment, both micro or personal factors such as skills and capacities, and macro factors such as the industry as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.881" offset="975104">And in this situation, though, the source of this perceived distinction, in our judgment, lies not in the language, not in the structure, not in the history, not in the decisions of this Court, but, instead, it lies in what can be best called 62-year-old dicta, drawn from a case in which the central question that we're now dealing with was not even a factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.296" offset="1084714">That case, McCormick, a 1933 opinion out of the 9th Circuit... we would reach the same conclusion in McCormick regardless of whether we're following the Fleetwood Rule, allowing consideration for modification purposes of all factors, or following the more rigid rule that the 9th Circuit adopted, simply because Fleetwood lost his income because there was a depression.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.752" offset="1174575">He didn't... and therefore he sought more compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.274" offset="1192651">Even under our rule, no more compensation would be payable because the loss... this additional loss... is unrelated to the injury itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="279.804" offset="1246777">Fleetwood is the name of the worker involved in the 4th Circuit case as to which the 9th Circuit's opinion in this proceeding stands in contrast.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.340" offset="1280945">I've forgotten the name of the worker in McCormick.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.392" offset="1293066">Another case relied upon in Rambo and by Petitioner at length is Pillsbury.</text>

            <text syncTime="301.097" offset="1331936">And in both cases is... there has been repetition, we think thoughtless repetition, of those cases and their dicta throughout the years, and we don't think they have gained any greater significance than they originally possessed simply because they've been used at times in other cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.185" offset="1440292">The Benefits Review Board's rule... and it's been approved by, I think, all the circuits that have looked at it, requires the parties who are taking earnings at a date subsequent to the date of the injury to prove, as a matter of fact, what those new jobs or that new position would have paid at the time of injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.126" offset="1512077">There's always an effort to bring it back to erode the effects of inflation and make that not a meaningful factor.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert E. Babcock</label>
            <text syncTime="357.884" offset="1559097">Well, it would depend on whether one were working from the 9th Circuit or the 4th Circuit position.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.899" offset="1579159">Let's presume that Mr. Rambo had his injury after he had been trained and gained the skills to be a crane operator and was now making much higher earnings than the typical longshoremen.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.487" offset="1633494">If you took the 9th Circuit approach and a year passed and then containers were replaced by rail cars or some other form of unloading, Mr. Rambo would not, even if his physical... would not, under that circumstance in the absence of a change in his physical condition, gain anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.019" offset="1707577">Improvement or deterioration of physical condition is always a... even within the 9th Circuit's view... basis for modification.</text>

            <text syncTime="428.630" offset="1842056">I don't think that lies within the term "conditions" itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.062" offset="1855744">You have to look to some of the other things that will limit the frequency of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.727" offset="1874447">The prospect of success is one, because an employer who is unsuccessful pays both his and the claimant's attorney's fees in the process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1964.455" offset="7985324">"The Director's construction will not overburden the agency and courts with modification requests because, as discussed above, a change in wage-earning capacity necessary to support modification must be a change in an employee's capacity to earn wages because of injury. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.664" offset="8050212">The vice of the... the Director's position is she leaves out the causation issue, and she jumps right to the wage-earning capacity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2036.951" offset="8275388">But isn't it true that this whole statutory scheme is a replacement of the tort liability scheme in which, if they'd been injured, you got a recovery, and later on, when he recovers completely, he still keeps whatever he got in the tort case?</text>

            <text syncTime="2067.471" offset="8397432">And so he felt that you wouldn't cut it off at any later time because it's been secure and determined.</text>

            <text syncTime="2156.189" offset="8752279">I think a couple of points about them and how long and why there isn't an overburden... and you can go back to '81, and the... and the 5th Circuit's opinion, Hole v. Miami Shipyard, where Fleetwood is presaged, by saying we're going to give a 1 percent de minimis, as many of the judges did and the 5th Circuit approved, in order to avoid the running of what was seen as a sometimes harsh statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.244" offset="8852485">And they provided this 1 percent award because the economic effects might materialize later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.770" offset="8878607">So we have maybe 15 years of experience with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.122" offset="8891982">And the averages... I just checked... the number of cases... new cases... filed under the Longshore Act dropped from 4,500 in 1984, when Fleetwood came out, to the average of 3,500 to 3,700 in the intervening decade.</text>
