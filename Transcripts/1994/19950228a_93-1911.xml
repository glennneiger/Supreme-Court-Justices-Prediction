            <text syncTime="63.953" offset="403224">This case comes to this Court from the Ninth Circuit's decision holding that Hawaii Administrative Rule 17-201-18(b), our burden-of-proof rule, creates a liberty interest entitling every inmate in the Hawaii penal system to a procedural due process review under the standards of Wolff v. McDonnell for every assignment to disciplinary segregation of 4 hours or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.600" offset="509804">In so holding, the Ninth Circuit ignored nearly a half-dozen decisions of this Court that characterize the Wolff case as applying solely to regimes that threaten the loss of good-time credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.549" offset="565601">The State of Hawaii has no system of good-time credit, nor does even our parole system make a disciplinary finding a necessary impact on parole.</text>

            <text syncTime="146.487" offset="733307">Yes, and Justice Souter, I would say that the driving force for parole decisions today in our State would be prison overcrowding.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.155" offset="780014">That would be another reason for granting early parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.828" offset="794643">But it has no necessary impact, and inmates who have very good records in prison could be denied parole for any number of reasons, and inmates that have very bad records in prison could be granted parole for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.567" offset="853680">The Ninth Circuit also ignored a lengthy summary judgment record that tells us what Demont Connor's assignment to disciplinary segregation actually meant in real-world terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.447" offset="913134">He was assigned, before he was assigned in disciplinary segregation, to Module A, and Module A was the most restrictive general population module in the entire Hawaii penal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.985" offset="967364">As a result, his assignment to disciplinary segregation meant only the loss of certain privileges, and was not a major change in the conditions of his confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.153" offset="1008011">We ask the Court, as it decides this case, to keep five things in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.949" offset="1035178">First, disciplinary confinement is only one stopping point along a continuum of penalogical responses, and is merely the combination of one set of privileges in lieu of another and we submit that, unless the court is prepared to federalize through the Due Process Clause all State-created privileges in prison, it must reverse the decision of the Ninth Circuit below.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.359" offset="1164850">You said the only difference was the loss of certain privileges.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.040" offset="1243531">There are a number of provisions, and I'm prepared to discuss those.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.144" offset="1259936">When the inmate was in Module A, he was subject to lock-down already for 16 hours a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.498" offset="1289402">When he went to disciplinary confinement, his amount of lock-down time increased, but the inmate was also entitled to out-of-cell exercise time, shower five times a week, religious counseling, legal counseling, as well as a monthly visit with his family, non-contact visit.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.276" offset="1380517">The number of visits went down.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.865" offset="1390862">It would have gone down from eight to one.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.249" offset="1404341">He would have lost the one telephone call that he could make of a personal nature, although he would have had the right to make legal, official phone calls to counsel or to the State Ombudsman.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.735" offset="1450316">In addition, the inmate would have lost, when he moved from Module A, the right to watch television and to receive certain newspapers, but he would be entitled to have both religious and nonreligious reading materials in the disciplinary holding unit.</text>

            <text syncTime="493.437" offset="2121141">Your Honor, we ask the Court in this case to look at the structure of cases such as Wolff v. McDonnell, as well as the extensive progeny in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.157" offset="2172027">The underlying theme of this Court's decisions is that prison managers need flexibility and discretion, and to the extent the Constitution intrudes upon that by weighing procedural due process requirements upon them, the Court has always been solicitous of categories of conduct that are meaningfully different from one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.592" offset="2273800">For example, in the Wolff case itself, the Court distinguished between parole revocation, where the person is already out, and good-time credits where the person is in but has earned a certain expectation of getting out by a particular day.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.892" offset="2334927">We think that this case is categorically different from even that situation, the good-time credit case, and that the appropriate constitutional response is to say that this is not an area... even where for management reasons we may have mandatory rules, that this is not an area, Justice Kennedy, where the Due Process Clause should be the constitutional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.658" offset="2433983">One of the points that I make, and I make it now, is that we do submit that there will still be backstop constitutional protection against arbitrary assignments to disciplinary segregation, but the source of that right should not be the variegated and sometimes complex requirements of the procedural Due Process Clause, but it would be the requirement of minimum rationality under the Equal Protection Clause.</text>

McDonnell and, in fact, I think Wolff v. McDonnell layes out a set of procedures that are well understood in the prisons of this country that are applied every day in hundreds of different situations, that are accepted, and about which there's not a lot of controversy, and they are very deferential to the States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3493.804" offset="14122630">I mean, they've tried... this Court has tried to talk about things that are, I believe, things of real substance, including administrative segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.799" offset="14154604">Where a State actually creates rules that limit the imposition of administrative segregation like Hewitt, this Court has found that that is certainly an important enough matter that the State can be held to its word, and it is an important matter and it may be that in some circumstances administrative segregation would also raise constitutional questions, but the line about duration of confinement would first of all not be a bright line, because in this case we should fall within it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.159" offset="14267975">His duration of confinement, at least from the standpoint of what the potential punishment is, clearly makes this an important decision that's going to be made about misconduct, and there are many different interests in a prison about which prison authorities could create regulations that might or might not create a liberty interest, and I think--</text>

            <text syncTime="3621.118" offset="14631809">For example, in almost every State regulation that we looked at, if there's minor punishment, relatively minor punishment, the procedures of Wolff are not applied.</text>
