            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="60.789" offset="387333">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="67.894" offset="415754">The issue in this case is whether a criminal defendant may waive the protection of evidence rule 410 and criminal rule 11(3)(6), both of which provide in identical terms that evidence of plea discussions is not admissible against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.320" offset="485449">Respondent was charged with drug possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.308" offset="501331">He and his lawyer sought a meeting with the prosecutor to explore whether the Government might use respondent as a witness against others.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.747" offset="539156">The prosecutor agreed to the meeting because respondent in turn agreed that if he said anything at the meeting that was inconsistent with any later trial testimony by him, the prosecutor would have the right to use the statements at the meeting to impeach the trial testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.291" offset="609269">Respondent ultimately did go to trial, testified, and was impeached in accordance with that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.112" offset="636541">The jury found him guilty, but the Ninth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.564" offset="650438">It ruled that the rights conferred by rule 410 and rule 11(e)(6) are not waivable, and that an agreement purporting to do so would chill plea bargaining and violate public policy for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.574" offset="702474">We brought the case here because we strongly disagree with those conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.525" offset="722223">We start with the language of the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.910" offset="731731">The rules provide that evidence of plea discussions is inadmissible not in all circumstances but only when offered against the defendant who made the statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.000" offset="768094">That language strongly indicates, we think, that the rules are intended for the protection of the criminal defendant, and that is consistent with a long tradition in our system of laws generally, and of the practice of the rules of evidence in particular, as Justice Scalia noticed in Green v. Bulk Laundry, of providing special protections for defendants in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.549" offset="862343">This Court has looked at the issue of waiver in many cases involving those special protections, including some of the most valuable rights secured by the Constitution to criminal defendants, and has consistently ruled that those protections may be waived by defendants.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="194.708" offset="922947">So in your view the Government, as part of its standard plea bargain form, asks the defendant to waive its... his right not to have the testimony used in the Government's case on direct, for all purposes?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="211.003" stopTime="227.964">
            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="211.003" offset="988149">We think that so far as the waivability of the rule goes, Justice Kennedy, which is really a question about whether the right is personal, the answer to that is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.895" offset="1031721">I cannot imagine that any criminal defendant would do so unless he otherwise intended to plead guilty.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="227.964" stopTime="245.176">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="227.964" offset="1055963">Well, let's suppose he really wanted a plea bargain discussion and the Government says, now, one of the things you are waiving here is your self-incrimination privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.070" offset="1092430">We're going to play a cassette recording of this entire plea bargain to the jury, of the plea bargain discussion to the jury if the plea bargain doesn't work.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="245.176" stopTime="273.410">
            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="245.176" offset="1124822">Justice Kennedy, if he makes that judgment knowingly, it's no different from the judgment that criminal defendants made every day... excuse me, make every day concerning whether they wish to confess to the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.067" offset="1176440">Ordinarily we think of that as an affirmative good, and if they recognize that this is evidence that may be used against them, and they do so knowingly, I doubt that very many will do it, but there will be no problem with that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="273.410" stopTime="297.043">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="273.410" offset="1237775">But of course the difference is they don't waive the rule before they've committed the crime, and here, the... you're asking for the waiver before presumably... the Government is asking for the waiver presumably before the misstatement is made, and before the defendant is faced with, in effect, deciding whether to accept the consequence of the waiver.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="297.043" stopTime="299.478">
            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="297.043" offset="1332338">Well, that may be true, Justice Souter--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="299.478" stopTime="301.513">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="299.478" offset="1342056">Maybe that shouldn't make a difference, but it is a difference.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="301.513" stopTime="396.455">
            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="301.513" offset="1350206">--Yes, it is a difference, and it should not make a difference for the following reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.381" offset="1369641">He, unlike the Government, knows what he will say, and he is... he has perfectly... he has it perfectly within his control to sort of understand what it is that he will tell the Government and to make a judgment as to whether that is something that he wishes to communicate to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.830" offset="1455427">But your point I think raises a point on the public policy part of this argument that is very important and that I think bears stressing, which is that the context in which the Government asks for this is extremely important, and we brought this case to the Court on the assumption that the context is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.010" offset="1548214">And the context is that the Government is talking to the defendant in the context of his proffer of cooperation, and in the context of that proffer of cooperation, the Government often would not meet with a criminal defendant even in the absence of a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.722" offset="1614983">And there is a good reason for that, because statements made by cooperating witnesses may be used in undercover work that is dangerous and life-threatening, and may be relied on to put other people in jail, and we think that it is reasonable for the Government to think that somebody who is coming to the Government to cooperate only if he can retain the ability to tell a different story under oath at a later trial, should not be a Government witness.</text>

            <text syncTime="397.824" offset="1735460">But doesn't the statute take care of that by saying that it preserves the right to prosecute him for perjury?</text>

            <text syncTime="1132.730" offset="4675072">Say, for example, if the head of the Gambino crime family gets taken in with his underling, Sammy the Bull, and the Government knows that in order to put the head of the Gambino crime family in, in jail, it will need the testimony of the underboss, you can very well think of that person as having a great deal of bargaining power.</text>

            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="1251.224" offset="5149037">--Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.409" offset="5153739">I mean, under our view, the first and threshold question is always whether the right is intended to be a personal one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.682" offset="5186863">And if you take, for example, Rule 11, you can read the language, for example, of Rule 11(a) and compare it to the language of Rule 11(e)(6) which is at issue here, and you will see that the language in Rule 11(a) is quite different, and it imposes duties expressly on the court to make sure that at the time of the guilty plea the defendant will be advised of X, Y, and Z, and it goes on to impose other duties on the court of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.070" offset="5316430">And if you look at the background of the rule, you understand that the point of that part of the rule is to make sure that a clear record will be made of a guilty plea so that we can in effect dispose quickly and efficiently of baseless collateral attacks later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.245" offset="5377138">So that type of rule, which by its terms and by its policy is intended for the protection of society when society and the criminal defendant have interests that are adverse, would be one that would not be waivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.957" offset="5451953">My second example would be the Speedy Trial Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.926" offset="5463865">The speedy trial right under the Sixth Amendment is one that is understood to be one of the defendant, and waivable by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.247" offset="5493122">During the consideration of the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, however, it developed that Congress was principally concerned about the fact that people were not having trials quickly enough and were out committing crimes, and the preamble of the Speedy Trial Act describes it as an act to, if I may quote the actual language,</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.547" offset="5594373">"to assist in reducing crime and the danger of recidivism by requiring speedy trials. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.188" offset="5636900">Now, you then look at the legislative history of that act, and before that act came into full effect in 1979, Congress passed a new statute that changed it somewhat significantly, and the committee report by the Senate expressly stated that in the context of the statutory right the interests of society and the interest of the criminal defendant are adverse, because in a memory-dependent system it will always be to the defendant's... or it will often be to the defendant's advantage to stretch out the length of time that the trial should take.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.384" offset="5813697">It's the old notion that a continuance is as good as an acquittal, except that it doesn't last as long, and it goes further to say, in a section entitled "Waiver", that because of the strong public policy, as already explained, that it is their strong view that this right should not be waivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.064" offset="5904394">Now, the right of that nature, where the purpose of the right is to take care of certain circumstances in which the interests of society and of the criminal defendant are adverse, and one of the interesting points about the example that I just gave you, the Speedy Trial Act, is that that is one of the examples in which Congress expressly adverts to the background rule and acknowledges that ordinarily all rights are waivable, and it said so in terms, and then has a section saying, "Waiver", we don't want this to be waivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.255" offset="6053187">And our point here is that the background rule in our society is so strongly that, that all rights are waivable, that when someone claims that a particular one should not be, or is not, the burden is on that person to make some sort of affirmative showing based on what is there by way of legislative materials that might show that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.538" offset="6150258">Now, the argument that has been made here really goes in two parts, one as to the mandatory language of the rules, and as to that one, our basic answer is that the structure of the rules from their language is no different from the hearsay rules, everyone knows that those are waivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.582" offset="6222461">And the second one goes to the policy of the rule to encourage candid communications, and our basic short answer to that is that that is no different from the rules that govern privileges for confidential communications under Rule 501, like the attorney-client privilege, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.596" offset="6306471">It is the purpose of that rule to encourage candid communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.036" offset="6332280">The rule is that the statement can't be used for any purpose, even for impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.422" offset="6357775">Congress must have contemplated, therefore, and the courts must have contemplated that there would be some cases in which the unavailability of the rule would lead to perjury being unrebutted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.980" offset="6412005">But precisely because the effect of the rule is to keep evidence from the fact-finder, the usual rule is that they are not construed broadly, and in fact no one would con... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.705" offset="6458921">No one would say that they may not be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.590" offset="6470520">And I see that I have very little time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.942" offset="6479924">I would like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1590.396" offset="6505733">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.966" offset="6536035">Respondent's argument begins at the heart of the Government's waiver theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.454" offset="6557978">The Government maintains that many mandatory rules, like rights, carry a general presumption of waivability, that we must evaluate all mandatory rules and statutory procedures against a backdrop of the overarching implied waiver principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.463" offset="6617955">To support this contention, the Government cites the stipulation practice, and the Shutte case, a 120-year-old case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.919" offset="6651809">The stipulation practice, however, is fundamentally different from the Government's affirmative waiver regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.739" offset="6679081">Stipulations are an old, common law practice which began well before the passage of the Federal Rules of Evidence and continues today, but it is a very limited doctrine, and allows parties to avoid proving nondisputed issues, or issues which at the time are not perceived material to the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.719" offset="6755045">The purpose behind stipulations is to save time and expense, rather than having the parties go through the formality of proving a fact not at issue, and that's always what stipulations have always been, never more.</text>

            <text syncTime="2382.171" offset="9672818">To me that... it's counterintuitive to the very specificity and intricacy of the rules, and that they tried to balance all these interests, and they tried to realize that in creating effectively the Rule 106 or the exception that creates the completion doctrine that if there was abuse that the Government could avoid it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2708.031" offset="10976224">There, the judge invited stipulations that alternate jurors could sit in with the jurors during deliberation in violation of Rule 24(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.469" offset="11014049">The parties ultimately agreed, and the case... and the case... defendant was tried and convicted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2729.027" offset="11060234">I mean, to stipulate to the violation of 24(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.396" offset="11073713">The Court agreed, or it was assumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.431" offset="11085834">Justice Kennedy in his concurring opinion seemed to indicate that yes, it was error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.835" offset="11099522">The Government agreed and conceded it probably was error, and so the analysis whether... rose to the level of plain error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.822" offset="11127421">So there's a fundamental distinction here, and I think maybe, going back, you know, that a careful reading of United States v. Olano will make that absolutely clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.428" offset="11161798">It's the Court's holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.296" offset="11173292">I think that I really disagree with the Government's characterization of the prestatement rules as rights, and they do it, and they argue it basically because the protections just run to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.675" offset="11242882">But we know that through the advisory committees they limited the protection of the defendant just because... just to the defendant because they wanted... they didn't want third parties getting the protection of the rules because they thought that that rule was too broad, and I think it's fair to assume that they felt the Government didn't need the protections because the defendant is usually the one that's giving the incriminating and helpful information, not the other way around.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.806" offset="11343401">So it's a fundamental misreading of the rules to say that that's a right just because it's protection that runs to the defendant, and it's even more of a misreading when you look in a larger context and see that Congress really wanted cases settled, and their view... we may disagree with it, but their view was that the best way to balance the interest and get cases settled was to have this exclusion as an absolute exclusion in every case, so the system and institution could work efficiently.</text>

            <text syncTime="3183.840" offset="12879506">The first is that Congress did not think about the issue of waiver, and it is our view here that, given what the consequence of the other side's view for the truth-finding process of the trial, only the most clear evidence that waiver was required to be precluded should suffice, because at the end of the day, what we're talking about is a requirement that tells the Government that it is required to sit on its hands and let perjury go unrebutted while it knows that it's going on, and where evidence could come in in accordance with the freely given waiver that could tell the jury that this is a person who has given inconsistent statements on the very same issue that they have to make judgment on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.123" offset="13072603">Congress did not think about the separate, legal concept of waiver.</text>
