            <text syncTime="37.806" offset="289967">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="44.760" offset="317761">The heart of the issue before the Court today is the use of the word "may" in the context of the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act, which provides that the Federal courts may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.923" offset="394457">We contend that the word "may", as used in that context, means three things and only three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.957" offset="422564">The first is the literal connotation of the word, such that the Federal courts may grant the relief requested and make a declaration, the second meaning is that the court may grant the declaration provided there is a justiciable controversy, and the third meaning, the final meaning, is that the court may grant the relief provided the case does not fall within the category of cases presenting exceptional circumstances as described by this Court's Colorado River doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.731" offset="561640">The present analytical framework of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals fails in the third respect, and that is, it gives no balancing of the guidelines that were established in Colorado River and Moses Cone against the virtually unflagging obligation of the district court to accept jurisdiction of the case, and that is precisely the fatal flaw in the Fifth Circuit's approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.771" offset="693820">The majority of the circuits around the country have adopted the Colorado River Moses Cone analytical framework, and that seems to be working well with the district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.829" offset="738019">They are able to use the factors that have been established as the six factors to be considered in such cases, they balanced those factors, weighed it against the concept that jurisdiction is virtually unflagging, and they either decide--</text>

            <text syncTime="169.882" offset="818267">We're dealing with a request for a declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.685" offset="837493">It was my understanding, as I think it was Borchard's, who wrote the act, that a declaratory judgment, that that is a matter within the discretion of the trial court, that there is jurisdiction, but it need not be exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.628" offset="921190">That's the way the author of the act described it.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.330" offset="932057">That's what the notion of a declaratory remedy is.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.013" offset="946790">Well, if it's too iffy, the court says we won't handle it, for any of a variety of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.536" offset="968837">Isn't that what a declaratory action is?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_a_orlando" startTime="212.970" stopTime="271.038">
            <label>Mr. Michael A. Orlando</label>
            <text syncTime="212.970" offset="990571">--Yes, Your Honor, I agree with you, and I agree that that's what Mr. Borchard's understanding of the remedy was as well, is that a new Federal remedy was being created.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.239" offset="1035710">It was something that at that point in time the Federal courts would not have had the ability to decide a case that just sought a declaration, because there was no Federal remedy along those lines, but the heart of the issue is that there must be a distinction between the exercise, the threshold question of the exercise of jurisdiction versus the granting of the equitable remedy being sought, and the petitioners herein do not contend that granting of a declaration is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.923" offset="1186385">The wording of the statute is contrary to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.265" offset="1195789">What we do contend is that there is discretion to grant the declaratory judgment.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="271.038" offset="1222852">But isn't... doesn't it make sense to infer that there is a derivative or implicit discretion to determine whether to go ahead and have a trial on the issue, because let's assume we apply Colorado River, Moses Cone, or any other set of criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.889" offset="1282306">If the court right at the threshold says it's perfectly clear that this is a case in which it's quite unlikely that we would, in fact, grant relief, that is a very good reason for the court at that stage to say, we therefore are going to abstain.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.549" offset="1340925">Why doesn't... why isn't that a sensible way to give practical effect to the discretion that you concede?</text>

            <text syncTime="311.645" offset="1385333">The only disagreement that the petitioners have with the way things are happening in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is that what is essentially unfettered discretion is given to the district judge to abstain on that threshold--</text>

            <text syncTime="329.086" offset="1455028">Your reference to unfettered discretion I think sort of takes its significance from the fact that you continue to reiterate throughout your argument that you have here this morning that there is this unflagging obligation to exercise discretion, which I took you to mean was something inconsistent with abstention, absent an overwhelming case for abstention, and that really is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.514" offset="1564742">If, in fact, there is the derivative discretion that I was talking about, then we are not in a situation in which there is this unflagging obligation as we are in the circumstances which Moses Cone and Colorado specifically addressed.</text>

            <text syncTime="461.663" offset="1985418">Well, it seems to me that in your argument so far you have talked about the discretion not to grant declaratory relief as if it were abstention, and it seems to me those are very different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.912" offset="2046336">Now, it may well be that many of the factors you look to with the abstention determination parallel the factors that you look to with reference to declaratory relief, but I suggest that perhaps the one factor that is not present in declaratory relief is a virtual unflagging obligation, and it seems to me that you are conflating in all of your discussions so far abstention and failure to grant declaratory relief in the sound discretion of the court, and that those are analytically two quite separate foundational principles for the court to consider.</text>

            <text syncTime="526.605" offset="2245180">We're not standing before this Court contending that the Colorado River Moses Cone analysis is not a threshold issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="533.460" offset="2272556">It is something that the court, the district court in the very first instance, on a motion to dismiss by a respondent should go through the analysis of looking at a given set of standards and say, either this case should be dismissed or stayed based on the guidelines as set by this Court, and--</text>

            <text syncTime="622.098" offset="2627090">And I would ask the Court that it adopt this, what I would term prudential deference, in the same situation of a declaratory judgment remedy with a diversity based case, and that's what this Court is presented with here today, is the basis for Federal court jurisdiction is purely diversity, do not have a Federal question involved in this case, and under that--</text>
