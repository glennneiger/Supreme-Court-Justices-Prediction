            <text syncTime="64.992" offset="395068">The act, when read as a whole, demonstrates that it was not intended to regulate the behavior or conduct of attorneys when they are performing acts which are uniquely capable of performance by attorneys by reason of their licensure.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.973" offset="459016">The act is ambiguous, and a... by its definition of debt collector, and a literal application of the language of that statute, that act, would result in absurd outcomes, when reviewed with other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.256" offset="524218">The congressional intent clearly establishes that Congress never intended the act to reach the conduct of lawyers performing the function of lawyers.</text>

            <text syncTime="172.705" offset="825984">Now, it may raise other practical problems, but if you look at that definition, it would appear possible that a lawyer could be a debt collector.</text>

            <text syncTime="200.103" offset="935594">I think the phrase "debt collector" is clearly understandable when it is focused to collection agencies who through the mails or through the use of phone contact bring personal pressure and contact to bear upon an individual to pay a debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.785" offset="1014275">A lawyer, on the other hand, engaged in litigation, applies to a court, and asks a court to find a debt to be due, and asks a court to order the payment of that debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.691" offset="1057951">There is a difference between the two, and when read in the context of this statute, the definition of "debt collector" unless... unless there is some explanation of what it means to collect a debt, remains ambiguous.</text>

            <text syncTime="266.705" offset="1201938">That seems to refer to the peculiar functions that lawyers perform, and it would seem that the exception that used to be there is, in its terms, remarkably close, if not identical, to the exception that you want us to find as a way to resolve the ambiguity, and yet that was repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.909" offset="1278738">And doesn't the repeal of that language, which referred to lawyers acting as attorneys, cut against you and resolve the very ambiguity that you raise?</text>

            <text syncTime="2525.725" offset="10238007">The answer is, it is probably not a communication, but in any event it is a common and, in effect, general practice among collection attorneys to attach a sheet of paper to the end of the first pleading containing the FDCPA warnings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2669.493" offset="10813119">And notwithstanding this, we have a commentary which is read by petitioners to say... to create an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.701" offset="10850004">There is no authority to create such an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.460" offset="10860975">An administrative agency, much less its staff, cannot create statutory exemptions without some basis in the congressional enactment that purports to authorize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.827" offset="10902458">The staff commentary, incidentally, does not actually support petitioner's position in this case, insofar as it applies to the letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.265" offset="10944253">The staff says that if an attorney does not engage regularly in consumer debt collection activity, he's not subject to the act insofar as litigation conduct is concerned, but it is now conceded by petitioners that they do engage regularly in consumer debt collection activity, such as sending consumers dunning letters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.629" offset="11041638">So basically, we have a statute which I think is plain on its face, when you consider the sequence of basic definition of debt collection, which even in Black's Law Dictionary covers suing someone for a debt, the original attorney exemption, and the removal of that attorney exemption while all along litigation conduct by collection agencies is regulated, and intentionally regulated, by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.809" offset="11154382">If you look at the legislative history, you find, again, an intent on the part of Congress to subject lawyers to regulation that did not heretofore exist.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel A. Edelman</label>
            <text syncTime="2790.152" offset="11295757">Your Honor, insofar as the issue before the Court is concerned, namely, adding charges to debts which are not expressly authorized, Congress intentionally, and with application to both lawyers and other debt collectors, imposed a strict standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.283" offset="11364302">A consumer cannot be subjected to any charge that someone might be able to dream up a nonfrivolous argument in support of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.420" offset="11404844">Congress was careful about this, because it realized that the vast majority of collection lawsuits go by way of default judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.283" offset="11432325">There is no one there to argue against the lawyer, and accordingly, it made the standard one of whether the debt is expressly authorized, or whether the charge is expressly authorized by the instrument creating the debt, or permitted by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.945" offset="11502960">It's not an unfair standard, because first, if no one is going to argue against the imposition of the charge, it shouldn't be routinely imposed where it will greatly... as in this case, greatly increase the amount of the debt, and the consumer is not represented and says nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.930" offset="11590836">In addition, normally, most collection lawyers are enforcing printed form contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.073" offset="11611421">It's very easy for the creditor to solve the problem by simply providing for the charge, and then if it's not prohibited by law, it falls within 1692f(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.520" offset="11649246">So Congress did tighten the standard, and it would not be appropriate for an attorney to argue that a consumer is liable for insurance or some other charge that a nonfrivolous argument could be made with respect to, but which is not expressly authorized in the instrument creating the debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.763" offset="11734196">That problem, or that restraint, has nothing to do with the attorney's status as attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.017" offset="11755199">The collection agency can't demand such a charge before the matter is in litigation, or during litigation, and the same restraint is imposed upon the attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.393" offset="11796681">So the answer to Your Honor's inquiry, Your Honor, is that the act imposes certain restrictions, it imposes them equally upon lawyers and nonlawyers who are collecting consumer debts, and in the 17 years that the act has been applied to collection agencies, these restrictions have not been found to impose an undue burden upon the collection of debts for consumers or the extension of consumer credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.669" offset="11901798">Congress had a... was faced with a problem in balancing the interests of collection agencies and then collection lawyers on the one hand and the public on the other, it drew that balance very carefully, and I think the judgment of Congress as expressed in the act should be respected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.164" offset="11979852">That judgment does not permit of an attorney litigation exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.026" offset="11999287">What the petitioner's argument, I think, really boils down to is an appeal to the reluctance of attorneys to impose liability on other attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.521" offset="12033246">The problem with that position is that Congress did exactly that after an 8-year trial period of an exemption, and specific provisions of the act address explicitly litigation conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.141" offset="12091760">There is simply no textual basis for a continued attorney exemption, whether limited to litigation or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.207" offset="12128018">Unless the Court has questions, that concludes my remarks.</text>

            <text syncTime="3013.978" offset="12191026">The focus that is appropriate is, what was the intention of Congress when they enacted this law, and whether the definition of "debt collector" has a fair meaning when read in the context of the entire statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.914" offset="12234807">It is clear, or should be clear, that it is ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.757" offset="12250167">Since it is ambiguous, the intention of Congress should be examined, and the intention of Congress is clear, as well as the interpretation of the FTC, although not binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.246" offset="12300113">Finally, Mr Annunzio, Representative Annunzio, prior to the enactment, stated that the amendment would not affect the practice of law by the Nation's attorneys.</text>
