            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="9.272" offset="123839">These consolidated cases come here on direct appeal from the United States District Court of the Western District of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.721" offset="157694">They concern a challenge to Louisiana's Congressional Districting Plan called Act 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.495" offset="184757">Act 1 contains two so-called majority-minority voting districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.501" offset="208790">One of them District 2 is located in the New Orleans area.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.615" offset="225299">The other District 4 begins in the northwest part of the State and runs southeast along the Red River to Baton Rouge.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.207" offset="255601">Appellees who do not reside in either majority-minority district claim that Act 1 is a racial gerrymander that violates the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.171" offset="303457">The District Court focusing particularly on District 4 agreed that Act 1 constitutes a racial gerrymander subject to strict scrutiny under the principles this Court announced two terms ago in Shaw versus Reno.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.014" offset="362808">It also held that Act 1 is not narrowly tailored to furthering a compelling governmental interest unless that it is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.062" offset="399066">Louisiana and the United States as a defendant-intervener appealed directly to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.972" offset="426651">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we do not reach the merits of appellees challenge to Act 1, because we conclude that appellees lack standing to bring it.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.891" offset="470328">It is well-settled and an order to bring suite in Federal Court, a plaintiff may not assert a generalize grievance against allegedly illegal governmental conduct, but instead must have personally suffered what our case is called “injury in fact”.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.057" offset="535007">We have held that racial classifications of any sort cause individualized injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.322" offset="560084">We have recognized in Shaw that in the voting context such classifications can cause special representational harms, but appellees do not live in the allegedly, racially gerrymander district where they might suffer these representational harms nor have they shown that they personally have been classified according to their race.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.189" offset="651513">Appellees therefore, have failed to demonstrate Louisiana’s Redistricting Plan injured them, and as they have not carried their burden of showing they have standing to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.836" offset="694145">We vacate the District Court’s judgment and remand the case with instructions to dismiss the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.509" offset="720790">Justice Breyer has filed a concurring statement in which Justice Souter joins; Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment; Justice Ginsburg concurs in the judgment.</text>
