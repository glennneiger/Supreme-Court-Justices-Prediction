            <text syncTime="11.322" offset="200253">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.641" offset="209553">On the merits, the question in this case is whether counties in Alabama are liable for the unconstitutional actions of their sheriffs under 42 U.S.C. section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.615" offset="249468">In terms of jurisdiction, which I propose to discuss first, the question is whether the court of appeals had the authority, by the virtue of what it called discretionary pendent appellate jurisdiction, to resolve the county liability issue in the first place on an interlocutory appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.058" offset="315192">Let me state at the outset that, because we believe the court of appeals was wrong on the merits, we would be pleased if its opinion were vacated one way or the other, but of the alternatives, we take the opposition that the case should be resolved on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.135" offset="375482">We agree with our opponents, who asked the Eleventh Circuit to address this matter in the first place, that the court of appeals had the power to resolve the county liability issue coming as it did in the context of an otherwise valid interlocutory appeal on qualified immunity grounds, and with the trial already on hold in the district court until the appeal was completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.833" offset="466284">We disagree with our opponents when they contend that the county liability issue is independently appealable as a collateral order.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.689" offset="505677">As far as back as Owen v. City of Independence in 1980, this Court has stressed that local governments are not cloaked with common law or Federal constitutional statutory immunities, and those are the sorts of immunities that give rise to collateral order appealability in section 1983 cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.199" offset="871705">Why should we approve a court-made solution to the problem on the appellate level?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert B. McDuff</label>
            <text syncTime="186.387" offset="900544">Because I think the situation in 1367 is very different, because there you're talking about parties who are not... who at least prior to 1367 were viewed by this Court in the Findley case as not even being properly in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.414" offset="960625">And I think that's very different than a situation where everyone is properly in the Federal case, and the only question is whether the issue and the parties should be in the district court or in the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.539" offset="1009109">And it seems to me that it would be hard to imagine a construction of pendent appellate jurisdiction where the court of appeals could review pendent claims of the party that had the right to bring the interlocutory appeal in the first place but could not review claims brought by other parties in the same case, even though everyone was properly in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.420" offset="1108687">So I think there are two very different situations between the one encompassed by 1367 and the issue we have here.</text>

            <text syncTime="253.030" offset="1167097">--so you don't know what questions you're going to get, so I apologize for giving you this one, but we have held in the United States v. Stanley that there is no such thing as pendent appellate jurisdiction where the appeal... the reason the case is before the appellate court is section 1292(b), a certified question from the lower court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert B. McDuff</label>
            <text syncTime="279.931" offset="1274722">Because I think 1292(b) is a very different... well, let me answer it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.985" offset="1298859">I think 1291 is a much broader statute and has been interpreted much more broadly than 1292(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="292.491" offset="1324877">1292(b) is guided by very specific factors, and has a very specific procedure where both the district judge and the court of appeals have to approve an interlocutory appeal of an issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="303.347" offset="1368345">--Well, sure it does, but the basic reason why you assert pendent jurisdiction exists under 1291 is exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.952" offset="1398751">What the heck, we're up here, we may as well make a clean sweep of it and get rid of everything that needs to be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.106" offset="1419336">That same reason would apply in certified questions.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert B. McDuff</label>
            <text syncTime="319.974" offset="1434905">But in a certified question, there is not a preexisting appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.712" offset="1453817">In other words, the whole interlocutory appeal process starts anew with someone going to the district judge and saying we want to take this issue up, and I think that is a much narrower and much more focused situation than here, 1291, which is a broad jurisdictional statute, and where an appeal already exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.590" offset="1525288">I mean, for example, you could say that 1292(b), now that it has been passed and enacted and used, precludes the need for collateral order jurisdiction under 1291, and that we no longer need to have this whole notion of collateral orders under 1291 because you can achieve it under 1292(b), but collateral order jurisdiction has not been jettisoned because... I think because 1291 is a much broader statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="370.291" offset="1636152">The argument I would have made... would make is that you don't need pendent jurisdiction, because to the extent it is really efficient to dispose of these other issues, you could resort to 1292(b).</text>

            <text syncTime="422.209" offset="1843773">I mean, first of all we believe Abney can be read as this Court exercising its supervisory jurisdiction over the courts of appeals, saying you should not consider pendent claims in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.016" offset="1899048">Second, and fall-back from that is that Abney can be read as a... if it's read as a jurisdictional limitation, it applies only to criminal cases in light of this Court's statement in several cases that the final judgment rule should be enforced more strictly in criminal than in civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.978" offset="1962891">And then third, if Abney is read as jurisdictional, and it is read to cover civil and criminal cases, we believe it is in conflict with earlier decisions, such as the Isen case and the Stude case, and that Abney doesn't comport with the broad spirit of 1291, and if necessary should be overruled to that extent.</text>

            <text syncTime="562.282" offset="2404047">I think instead the Court should look at this the way it has interpreted 1291 in the past, whether it's with a final judgment rule or other rules, in a very broad way, in a way that will achieve the purposes of the... of 1291, which are the limiting of piecemeal appeals and the limiting of effective administration of justice, and another example I want to give is... is the final judgment merger rule, which of course has been around for a long time, and we refer to this at page 19 of our supplemental brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="956.265" offset="3980067">Now, in our view, the court of appeals erred because it looked to the label that was placed on the sheriff by the State rather than to the nature of the authority that he exercised, and the Court has made clear that the courts, when they determined who is a final policymaker for purposes of section 1983, must examine all of the relevant legal materials, including all the positive law, as well as the custom and usage, and although section 1983 was not intended to bring the States into Federal court, nevertheless that when the sheriff makes decisions and acts with the authority of the county, he may subject that county to liability under section 1983.</text>

            <text syncTime="1045.087" offset="4335332">And in our view the sheriff... the situation in Chambers County is a familiar one of separation of powers, where the sheriff has the power over law enforcement, and he has the final policymaking authority in that area, the county commission has the power of the purse and various other powers that county commissions have, and they have final policymaking authority in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.135" offset="4411505">And there are other... there are other officers in Chambers County who are similar to the county sheriff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.187" offset="4431672">There's the county tax assessor, there's the county tax collector, the county coroner.</text>

Stude, where it was a cross-appeal that the Supreme Court said should be... was properly considered by the court of appeals along with the originally appealable appeal by the cross-parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="3380.847" offset="13678392">--Justice Scalia, you asked me earlier about the Eleventh Amendment case law... I mean, the Eleventh Circuit case law regarding the Eleventh Amendment status of a sheriff's suit in an official capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.655" offset="13721546">There are some Alabama cases after Parker v. Williams that repeat the point in the Parker v. Williams footnote saying that sheriffs should be considered State officials for purposes of Eleventh Amendment immunity, and our view is that they are all a misconstruction of what Parker v. Williams said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.747" offset="13785912">And let me say, there's nothing in the record here, and there's nothing in the Alabama statutes, about who will pay a judgment against the sheriff under section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.520" offset="13821020">There's nothing to say it's going to be paid by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.372" offset="13832410">Our view, and this is from... I mean, our experience from outside the record is it's actually paid by an insurance policy from an association of county commissions, but at any rate, the Eleventh Amendment issue we do not think has been properly determined by any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.648" offset="13885595">We think the Eleventh Circuit's been wrong, and if it becomes necessary in this case, we will certainly challenge it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3451.093" offset="13959365">The only label they're talking about is section 112 of the constitution that says,</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.830" offset="13978278">"the executive department shall consist of a Governor and some other officers and a sheriff for each county. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.817" offset="14002206">That doesn't answer the question posed by section 1983 of for which body, for which governmental unit does the sheriff set policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.590" offset="14037314">Even if Alabama passed a statute and said, the sheriff sets law enforcement policy for the State, that label wouldn't answer the question, either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.259" offset="14068034">You'd have to look at the functions as set up by State law, and if usage is any different from State law, you look at that.</text>
