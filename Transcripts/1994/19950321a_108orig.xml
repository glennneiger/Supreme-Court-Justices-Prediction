            <text syncTime="64.756" offset="403920">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="69.144" offset="421474">This case is an original action brought by the State of Nebraska against the State of Wyoming in 1986 involving the equitable apportionment of the North Platte River.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.385" offset="474450">Questions involving the North Platte are not new to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.189" offset="493676">The North Platte was equitably apportioned by the Court in 1945, and unlike the case of Kansas v. Colorado that you've just heard, the Court is not called upon in this case to decide questions of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.282" offset="554072">Instead, the Court has before it exceptions of the special master's report on Nebraska's third motion to amend its 1986 petition, and Wyoming's first motion to amend its 1987 counterclaims.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="117.791" offset="616138">So there's been no trial before the... the master hasn't found facts and reached any conclusion.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dennis C. Cook</label>
            <text syncTime="126.730" offset="651874">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.646" offset="659502">Wyoming brings four exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.765" offset="672041">The first regards the recommended denial of Wyoming's first amended counterclaim and cross-claim, second the announced intent to have a trial on issues below Tri-State Diversion Dam, despite the exclusion of that in other parts of his ruling, third, the inclusion of Horse Creek in the claims Nebraska can litigate, and fourth, the inclusion of the groundwater issue in the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.368" offset="786457">The decision on the issues raised by the parties' exceptions is crucial, now, to break this endless circle of debate about which claims are in this case, what the geographic limits of this case are, and that decision then will instruct the parties and will shape the course of trial in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.317" offset="882170">My argument will focus on first the unfairness of the special master's recommendation to deny Wyoming's first counterclaim and first cross-claim, and second, upon the impact of the special master's proposed trial plans, the impact those plans will have on the certainty and stability of the Court's 1945 apportionment that ended Nebraska's apportionment at Tri-State Diversion Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.836" offset="1000243">With regard to the special master's recommendations on Wyoming's first counterclaim and first cross-claim, Wyoming believes that it is unfair, on the one hand, to deny a trial or any affirmative relief at this stage on Wyoming's claims that Nebraska and the United States circumvent the apportionment, when on the other hand the Court and the special master would entertain a trial on very similar issues raised by Nebraska with regard to the development of tributaries in Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.259" offset="1149977">To get to the point where the special master did to deny Wyoming's first counterclaims, he saw too much in a decision in 1993 of this Court that said there are no current limits on the State of Nebraska's diversions in this pivotal reach of the river between Whalen Diversion Dam and Tri-State Diversion Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.128" offset="1265438">He found that that answered the question completely with respect to Wyoming's counterclaims, but it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.050" offset="1301174">Wyoming's counterclaim is that Nebraska circumvents.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.336" offset="1318310">Now it is that the United States participates in the circumvention, but nonetheless, Wyoming argues that they violate the apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.310" offset="1358225">Nebraska in 19... throughout this case and part of the 1993 decision, ruled that... or argued that Wyoming violated the apportionment by constructing projects on tributaries in Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.271" offset="1426039">The Court ruled indeed there are no restrictions on those tributaries, but yes, Nebraska, you can come forward and seek to modify the decree and to add those restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.461" offset="1470761">The Court has now similarly found that there are no limits on Nebraska's diversions, but it's Wyoming's position that the Court has not rejected the possibility that Wyoming could seek to have those restrictions added, that definition of--</text>

            <text syncTime="468.013" offset="2017033">It is an addition to that approach, but let me explain why it's appropriate for the Court to consider that, and it's appropriate because in 1945 the United States brought the proposition to the Court that without a further definition in terms of quantity instantaneous diversion rates imposed on Nebraska's apportionment, that they would indeed circumvent the decree, or the apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.247" offset="2125912">The Court said, we won't speculate that Nebraska will do that, and we see no need to go beyond the 75-25 split of the natural flow at this point in time, but if that case develops, you may come back to the Court and ask for those additional... that additional definition on Nebraska's apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.780" offset="2216086">And that's the basic foundation, the unanswered question, or the reserved question the Court had agreed early on in 1987 to accept and allow Wyoming to pursue in its counterclaim, and our first counterclaim, amended counterclaim, is virtually the same counterclaim we brought to you in 1987, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="569.462" offset="2422767">That would then give Wyoming the advantage that if there were excess usable water, that Wyoming in effect would be able to either keep it or more easily claim it, so long as Nebraska got its so many acre feet.</text>

            <text syncTime="1604.526" offset="6563071">For example, downstream in the Big Bend reach here, it is also part of the South Platte Basin, so there are far... there are issues that range far beyond the mere enforcement, interpretation, and modification of the North Platte decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.636" offset="6623466">I am not saying that those issues are not relevant to a proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.404" offset="6638512">They are not ripe for this proceeding, and it would be improper for the Court, based on its prior rulings and the existing scope of the proceedings, to open the door for that type of claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.779" offset="6676024">It would really be an about-face on the Court's previous limitations on geography and time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.414" offset="6698594">It would expand the geographical scope of the case and expand the temporal scope of the case in a way the Court has never done before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.086" offset="6729314">Colorado's second argument is that as a prudential matter these issues are not justiciable or not ripe at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.192" offset="6761706">Even Nebraska concedes that, because they've not filed an exception to the special master's failure to grant their Court IV, and I think the reason that Nebraska has done that is that they feel they can try these issues in the back-door manner in which the special master has permitted the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.987" offset="6832863">More importantly, these issues should and must be resolved critically in another agency and another forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.974" offset="6856792">The endangered species and wildlife issues are currently a part of at least three proceedings, one involving Endangered Species Act interpretations on the Deer Creek and the Grayrocks Reservoirs, the issues are also in the FERC proceedings involving Lake McConaughy, and the three States have involved in a mutual cooperative approach through their Governor's office to try to accommodate and resolve the wildlife issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.708" offset="6971730">So importantly, I think this case ought to defer to those agencies and defer to that process to let it take its course, rather than fix in stone or enshrine in a decree of this Court the wildlife and endangered species needs involving the North Platte.</text>

            <text syncTime="1771.401" offset="7230552">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.320" offset="7254271">Mr. Justice Breyer, I want to go back to a question you asked of Mr. Cook.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.391" offset="7278512">You asked, I believe, something like, why didn't you just come to the Court on the theory that conditions had changed rather radically since 1945 and ask the Court to do what we think you're doing now, and that is, changing the apportionment formula?</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.970" offset="7368792">The answer to that question, and it's an answer that I think Wyoming is fully aware of, the answer to that question is, had they done that, the Court would have had to start essentially with a tabula rasa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.830" offset="7428246">That would mean that you would start all over with today's equities in all of their forums, and redo the entire case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.038" offset="7469102">That's the reason they did not want to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.324" offset="7486238">There are two points that I would like to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.026" offset="7501076">First, I would like to explain why the so-called geographical scope of this case is a conceptually ineffective way of addressing the proposed amendments, and second I would like to explain that Wyoming is attempting to convert the percentage apportionment into a mass allocation based on beneficial use limitations, an argument made by Wyoming and rejected in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.247" offset="7625941">In that regard, I would also like to explain why the Court should not upend long-settled expectations that have become an intrinsic part of the apportionment since 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.173" offset="7681634">The first point I want to make goes to Wyoming's second exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.076" offset="7705249">That is, to Master Olpin's understanding that he must evaluate all of the interests in Nebraska against which the threat of injury would be posed by new development in Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.086" offset="7769301">Wyoming and Colorado's argument in this regard is that you should not look at any uses below Tri-State Dam or outside the irrigation season.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.946" offset="7828756">Accordingly, Wyoming and Colorado are asking you not to take cognizance of admittedly existing interests outside the irrigation season or below Tri-State Dam that would or could be affected by the intended development.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.509" offset="7910989">The Court addressed this issue in 1993, and I believe rejected Wyoming's and Colorado's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.949" offset="7944739">The Court held that Nebraska had no preexisting rights on Deer Creek or on the Laramie River to interpret or enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.340" offset="7990297">At the same time, however, the Court provided Nebraska with the opportunity to establish new development on Deer Creek and on the Laramie River so that those equities can be balanced against the threat of injury from new development in Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.253" offset="8069918">Special Master Olpin has stated that he must balance all of the relevant equities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.859" offset="8108370">Wyoming is simply seeking to limit Nebraska's equities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.661" offset="8127596">In order to reach an equitable balance, we believe that the Court must juxtapose all of the equitable interests today in order to adjust the decree to meet present day conditions--</text>

            <text syncTime="2050.230" offset="8345876">What Mr. Olpin has done is to look at discrete proposed individual developments in Wyoming, think that certain injury is going to flow from any given development... for example, if a reservoir, a new reservoir would store and deplete nonirrigation season waters, which is what reservoirs, after all, are designed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.869" offset="8476383">You cannot assess the injury without looking at the nonirrigation season impacts of that reservoir, and they could be hydropower, they could be wildlife, they could be downstream irrigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2349.607" offset="9543329">The fourth cross-claim goes to the storage side of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.427" offset="9562659">Back in 1945 when the matter was addressed, everybody was fully aware when Wyoming argued that you should place beneficial use limitations on Wyoming, that you had to apportion storage water and natural flow at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.339" offset="9638310">In this regard, Wyoming made a statement in its response brief at page 19... let me quote it real quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.094" offset="9673314">"No one asserted in 1945, as Wyoming does now, a need for the Court affirmatively to require the Bureau's compliance with Federal law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.034" offset="9709050">"Such compliance was assumed. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.086" offset="9717304">"Thus, the issue that Wyoming's fourth cross-claim would bring was not before the Court in 1945. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.858" offset="9756383">Well, in 1945, that statement was most certainly not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.560" offset="9775192">What Wyoming did in 1945 was to assert that storage water in section 8 of the Reclamation Act as well as the related Federal and State law had to be brought before the Court's attention and had to actually be placed in the decree, in special provisions in the decree to make the decree enforceable as against the storage water contracts and the storage water deliveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.948" offset="9896713">Wyoming's view at the time was, if those provisions were not placed in the decree, that the only redress would be found in Federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.673" offset="9943629">That is, the contracts would be enforced as it was assumed that they would be enforced, but that could be done only among the proper parties and in the proper forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.396" offset="9990545">We do believe that there is an inconsistency between the master's recommendation with respect to the first counterclaim on the one hand and the fourth cross-claim on the other, but I think an analysis of what he did and a close evaluation of the briefs would lend itself more to our view than his on that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.881" offset="10096498">The second point I would like to make is that the Court rejected the theory of beneficial use limitations in 1945 for three sound reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="2529.189" offset="10261696">The second reason the Court did not adopt the beneficial use limitations is that the Court knew that storage was essential to doing any kind of mass allocation based on beneficial use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.698" offset="10319688">Third, the Court did not adopt the beneficial use theory because that would have required placing limitations on individual irrigation districts and private canals that were not in the case, and the Court simply doesn't do that kind of stuff in parens patriae actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.262" offset="10397951">Those three conditions have not changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.880" offset="10416445">The river still fluctuates wildly, you would still have to apportion both storage water and natural flow, and you don't define private rights in parens patriae cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.073" offset="10477258">Given that problem, what distinguishes the so-called inconsistency argument that Wyoming has made, what distinguishes what we're proposing and what Wyoming is proposing, is that Wyoming has something in the nature of a res judicata problem, or at least a repose and finality problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.772" offset="10568060">Finally, this Court has always been reluctant to reopen an apportionment, and you've been reluctant to do that for good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.229" offset="10613827">Once an apportionment is adopted, and this one is some 50 years old, all kinds of socioeconomic institutional reliance develops in layers on that apportionment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2690.445" offset="10906712">The United States excepts to the special master's allowance of Wyoming's fourth cross-claim, which alleges that the United States has failed to operate Federal reservoirs in accordance with the reclamation laws and storage water contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.668" offset="10955613">We believe that it would be inappropriate to address that claim in this original action for three related reasons going to the law, the parties, and the availability of another forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.958" offset="10992811">First, this Court's 1945 decree does not govern Wyoming's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.845" offset="11012351">Paragraph VI and XII(b) of the North Platte Decree explicitly state that the decree shall not affect storage water or in any way interfere with the Federal Government's operation of water storage facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.070" offset="11057177">The Court included those paragraphs in recognition that the Federal reclamation projects predated the 1945 apportionment, that private parties had contracted for storage water from those projects, and their rights in the operation of the projects were fixed by those contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.579" offset="11123214">Simply put, the decree at issue in this proceeding does not address the distributior of storage water because the contracts between the Bureau and the individual water users govern who receives that water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.237" offset="11169921">This Court was mindful of the Bureau's need to store water in priority with other users to satisfy its storage water contracts in 1945, but the Court made absolutely clear that the decree would not affect the delivery of storage water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.128" offset="11221435">Instead, any disputes would continue to be governed by the legal mechanisms that were already in place and available to the contracting parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="2826.833" offset="11452253">Paragraph 31 at E-11 says the United States has failed to operate the Federal reservoirs in accordance with applicable Federal and State laws, and has failed to abide by the contracts governing the use of storage water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.391" offset="11498542">Specifically, the United States has allocated storage water in a manner, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.243" offset="11513902">It then goes on to make various specific claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.861" offset="11524351">But the fact of the matter is that they're challenging how we can allocate storage water, and the storage water, you must remember, is defined in the decree, and it is only water in addition to what is natural flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.336" offset="11566251">When the Bureau provides water to the individual water users, it makes releases from the reservoirs, and in accounting for that water, it always ensures that the natural flow portion of the river is passed through the reservoir, and the storage water is only allocated thereafter, and this is all primarily an accounting procedure that only takes place after the water has been released.</text>

            <text syncTime="3343.820" offset="13520210">First of all, let me make it clear, the United States has never argued that these issues cannot be litigated in district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.656" offset="13543616">Our objection in the Goshen litigation was that the United States was sued under a provision of reclamation law that allows joinder of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.262" offset="13574023">Our objection was, you need to have all the necessary parties there in order to resolve this dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.900" offset="13596592">Subsequently, eight of the irrigation districts, eight of the thirteen irrigation districts joined into this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.470" offset="13622819">Now, looking at this with all the parties there, our objection is rather technical in terms of the fact that the United States was sued first, not... rather than sued later, so that is the reason why we have withdrawn that objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.195" offset="13669735">But overall, I think the important thing to recognize in this suit is that it does provide a forum for all of the necessary parties to litigate the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.883" offset="13704426">The contractors themselves have a very strong interest in the protection of their contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.454" offset="13726787">They currently are not parties to this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.254" offset="13737967">This suit has been involved... this original action has been going on for 8 years, and is rather complex, and there are certainly going to be claims, if you allow the fourth cross-claim to go forward, for those parties to intervene in this action.</text>

            <text syncTime="3480.875" offset="14068468">If we're going to add this fourth cross-claim in this forum rather than in another alternative forum, it is going to complicate this litigation tremendously.</text>

            <text syncTime="3514.614" offset="14203365">This is illustrated in the map at Appendix B of the special master's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.482" offset="14218829">So neither one of these States can represent all of the contractors' interests that are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.201" offset="14237742">We think it would make more sense, now that this case has been fully briefed in the district court, to allow that proceeding to go forward first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.374" offset="14266476">If at some later point that question... the issues that are resolved there implicate issues with respect to the decree, Wyoming can come back and seek an amendment of the decree, or seek whatever type of relief that they might think is appropriate at that point, but this... these issues have been litigated in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.800" offset="14332096">We think that that litigation should run its course rather than trying to complicate this litigation still further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.537" offset="14367100">As a separate matter, the United States objects to Wyoming's exceptions to the special master's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.726" offset="14391864">Wyoming is mistaken at the outset in characterizing this suit as an action to define the existing apportionment, but regardless of characterizations, the special master properly concluded that Wyoming's first counterclaim and first cross-claim should be denied insofar as they seek to replace this Court's percentage-based apportionment formula.</text>

            <text syncTime="3593.012" offset="14516938">Issues in the GID case versus the issue in our fourth cross-claim, our fourth cross-claim is much broader.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.435" offset="14546718">It is our claim that the operation of the storage facilities was a predicate of the 75-25 apportionment, as Justice Breyer has noted, and therefore, as that predicate operation changes and is no longer according to law, or according to contracts, then that clearly skews the entire process, and quite frankly the Court left open the door to look at allocation and storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.418" offset="14654656">It did not foreclose that, and furthermore it has allocated storage in both paragraph III and paragraph IV of the decree.</text>

            <text syncTime="3662.972" offset="14796867">Individual disputes on individual years, individual grievances, those can be adjusted, but what we're talking about is the broader failure to follow the law that impacts the apportionment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3679.934" offset="14864681">It was not necessary to say that word in the decree because it's such a fundamental concept that this Court has continued to recognize, and I say that because the opposite side of beneficial use is waste and misuse, and this Court has never sanctioned one State to waste and misuse water at the expense of another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.995" offset="14940958">Finally, I agree that this Court is reluctant to open apportionments and revisit those.</text>
