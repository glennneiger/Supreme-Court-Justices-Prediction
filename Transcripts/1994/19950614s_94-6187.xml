            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="86855">The second case is number 94-6187, Witte against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.451" offset="112559">In February, 1992, the petitioner here Steven Witte pleaded guilty to a federal marijuana charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.267" offset="143906">At sentencing, the District Court took into account under the guidelines, the total quantity of drugs involved not only in Witte's offensive conviction, but also of the narcotics involved in certain other uncharged criminal conduct arising out of the same conspiracy including a plan to import a quantity of cocaine from Central America.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.154" offset="235439">The Witte was later indicted for conspiring and attempting to import the same cocaine which was considered in the sentencing of the marijuana offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.231" offset="271697">The District Court dismissed the charges on grounds that punishment for the cocaine offenses would violate the Double Jeopardy's Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.368" offset="308269">The Court of Appeals for Fifth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.175" offset="319554">We granted certiorari and we affirm the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.303" offset="336063">Traditionally, a sentencing judge can consider a broad range of inquiry into the defendant's background, past criminal behavior and arriving at an appropriate punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.111" offset="379217">But the consideration of the uncharged conduct in deciding on a sentence within the statutorily authorized punishment range doesn't constitute punishment for that conduct for double jeopardy purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.753" offset="429791">That is, a defendant in that situation is only punished for the offenses of which he was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.437" offset="452569">In a case decided in 1959 called Williams against Oklahoma, we specifically rejected the claim that the double jeopardy principles bar a later prosecution or punishment for criminal activity where that activity has been considered at sentencing for a separate crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.461" offset="520697">Now the reason that this case and other cases applies of equal force here.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.927" offset="542535">Justice Kennedy and I have joined all but Part III of Justice O'Connors opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.028" offset="562911">Justice Stevens has joined only Part III.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.671" offset="573464">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
