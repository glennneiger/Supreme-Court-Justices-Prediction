            <label>Mr. Alan B. Morrison</label>
            <text syncTime="18.435" offset="219181">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="23.115" offset="237885">In March 1987, the respondent here issued an order to show cause to petitioner as to why he should not be deported from the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.931" offset="273203">Approximately 10 months later, after a hearing, the immigration judge ordered petitioner deported, and petitioner then filed an appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals, proceeding pro se with a brief of approximately 13 pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.293" offset="334643">Three-and-a-half years later, the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the order of deportation on July 26, 1991, in a brief opinion dealing with the issues presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.932" offset="385216">Less than a month later, acting pursuant to the rules of the Immigration Service, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration or reopening.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.257" offset="422518">He later filed a very short brief, and the Immigration Service attorney filed a reply in the middle of October.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.372" offset="446969">There the matter remained until the 3rd day of February, 1993, at which time the Board of Immigration Appeals denied the motion for reconsideration and reopening in an order that ran a page and a little bit onto the second page, most of which was boiler plate response to the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.685" offset="528158">Petitioner then filed a petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on the 16th February, less than 2 weeks after the order came down.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.071" offset="577790">He filed his brief shortly thereafter, and the Government filed its brief in the end of April 1993, a lengthy brief of some 33 pages, 14 of which dealt with the merits of the challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.811" offset="628677">In that brief, the Government said for the first time to petitioner, you are too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.884" offset="649052">You should have filed your petition for review shortly within the 90 days after July 1991.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.069" offset="685728">Oral argument was held shortly thereafter, and in early January the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued its ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.517" offset="719583">It concluded that the petition for review was timely with respect to the denial of the motion for reopening or reconsideration, but it was not timely with respect to the original decision, even though the motions were then pending before the Immigration Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.587" offset="787815">It agreed with the Government that the failure to file within the 90 days provided by the statute made the filing too late when it came in February 1993, and the question presented before this Court, on which the courts of appeals are badly divided, is, is that decision correct?</text>
            <text syncTime="181.121" offset="869944">The Government recognizes that under the usual rule in administrative law and judicial review, that a timely filed motion for reconsideration or reopening renders the decision of the agency not final, such that not only need not a petitioner seek judicial review at that time, but the petitioner may not seek judicial review at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.517" offset="979554">And the reason for that rule is a sound one of judicial economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.581" offset="995749">The courts should not become involved in deciding cases if the agency which has the matter before it has the ability and the power and under its rules the authority to reconsider the decision at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="228.591" offset="1059802">--I have two questions, Mr. Morrison.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.033" offset="1065549">Number 1, what happens if the petition for judicial review is filed first, and then the petitioner decides, I'll ask for a rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.824" offset="1120719">What happens then?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Alan B. Morrison</label>
            <text syncTime="244.775" offset="1124585">It is my understanding that the usual rule is that the filing of a petition for judicial review takes the matter into court, and that it does not divest the agency of the authority to reconsider, although it does not stop the court from considering the matter, and in that circumstance it is up to the court to decide whether it will choose to proceed with the case or allow it not to proceed.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>

            <text syncTime="286.273" offset="1290515">It only says they shall be consolidated, as I read it, if there are two or more petitions for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.559" offset="1311727">That is to say, it does not direct the court of appeals of the first case to hold it, and my reading of the cases is that some courts more or less automatically hold them if they are told.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.275" offset="1358538">In some cases some courts automatically don't hold them, and in other cases they do what seems to me the sensible thing to do, which is to look at the motion for reconsideration to see whether it really raises some new issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.933" offset="1401170">For instance, in the immigration area, where often the change in circumstances of the country to which the alien would be deported would be a very important element.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.120" offset="1433980">If somebody was, for instance, to be sent back to Bosnia, you would want to have the latest information on what the state of the world was in Bosnia before you sent the particular individual back.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.146" offset="1470029">On the other hand, if it was simply, you got it wrong and you misread your opinion or the opinion of the court of appeals there would be no particular reason for the court to stay that.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="338.260" offset="1498554">--My second question is whether the filing of the motion for reconsideration or for reopening simply tolls the period for review, or does it retroactively render the decision nonfinal so that you have the full period at the end of... once the petition for reconsideration is disposed of?</text>

            <text syncTime="366.039" offset="1609627">It wouldn't matter here in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.731" offset="1620389">My own opinion--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="369.793" offset="1624674">Mr. Morrison, would you clarify what you said before?</text>
            <text syncTime="371.954" offset="1633242">I thought you said that in most... the normal situation is, not only can you file the petition for reconsideration first, but if you do... if you do, you have no final order and you can't file a notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.004" offset="1693532">Maybe I misunderstood you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan B. Morrison</label>
            <text syncTime="388.756" offset="1700533">--Yes, that is correct, Your Honor, and the question I believe Justice Scalia was asking me, is that because it makes it a tolling that you stop at that point... suppose they filed it, as in this case, on day 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.473" offset="1751315">They filed the motion for reconsideration on day 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.416" offset="1767093">The question that Justice Scalia I believe asked me, does he... does the petitioner here have 90 days from the time of the denial of the motion for reconsideration, or 90 minus 26, which I think is 64, and I don't know of any case that answers that.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.978" offset="1825398">It is my opinion that the filing of the motion for reconsideration renders it not final.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.893" offset="1849013">This would be analogous, for instance, to what happens under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, where a filing of a timely motion for reconsideration under Rule 52a or 59 renders the decision nonfinal and you get your full 30 days at the end of that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="443.125" offset="1917976">What happens if the Attorney General then says, on the plane or on the ship, out you go?</text>
            <text syncTime="448.938" offset="1941173">One of the regulations says that the filing of an application for reconsideration does not stop the immediate deportation of the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.245" offset="1978476">Suppose you have filed for reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.988" offset="1993418">You say, then you have no final judgment, you can't come to the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.890" offset="2008987">The Attorney General says, I'm shipping this person out.</text>

            <text syncTime="474.287" offset="2042633">You may not go to the court of appeals under that circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.990" offset="2053395">Under 1105a(a)(10) the jurisdiction under habeas corpus in the district court is specifically preserved for that situation, and there are a number of cases where that arises where the alien would then go to the district court where he would have to obtain a stay of deportation, assuming that the agency didn't give it to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.684" offset="2140226">I might point out, of course, two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.624" offset="2147958">The first is, we do not concede in this case the validity of that regulation, because we believe that that regulation depends upon the authority under 8 U.S.C. 1252c, which is the authority to deport, and it says there must be a final order of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.645" offset="2212011">You then may have 6 months to deport the alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.357" offset="2222878">This case doesn't present that question, so we don't accept the validity of that regulation, and since the phrases are the same in both statutes, we think they should be interpreted together.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.024" offset="2261539">But even assuming the validity of the regulation, we would first point out that in many cases, as in this one here, Mr. Stone filed his motion for reconsideration in August of 1991.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.500" offset="2303439">At no time did the Service ever try to deport him.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.191" offset="2314202">Indeed, it has not to this day tried to deport him, even after it prevailed in the court of appeals, and so it is in some respects true that the regulation provides that, but it is not a process which automatically goes forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.962" offset="2369268">The statute, indeed, gives the agency 6 months to do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="599.864" offset="2544915">This case is not an unusual one in which a motion for consideration languished for 17 months before the Immigration Service, and the Immigration Service looks a little awkward trying to throw people out of the country before a) they decide the case and b) they have given them their statutory right to go to the court of appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="651.631" offset="2752014">But obviously neither of those cases is before us today, and the agency, even today when Congress told them in 1990 to issue new regulations, they finally got around to proposing them 4 years later, and those regulations continue, albeit under somewhat different circumstances, the right to file for reconsideration and for reopening.</text>

            <text syncTime="1532.810" offset="6276664">The Attorney General acted well within the authority delegated by Congress in establishing the administrative framework governing deportation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.095" offset="6309892">It's a reasonable interpretation and implementation of the act, and it warrants great deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.441" offset="6331207">The Attorney General struck a balance between several competing interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.832" offset="6348762">On the one hand, she promulgated regulations providing that an order... a deportation order becomes final upon dismissal of an appeal by the Board of Immigration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.359" offset="6386900">That rule serves the interest of finality and expedition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.223" offset="6402365">On the other hand, she authorized a narrow avenue of relief through motions to reopen or reconsider.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.677" offset="6428174">Those serve the interests in fair adjudication and permitting consideration of information that arises later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.161" offset="6458058">The Attorney General did not provide that such motions affect the finality of deportation orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.867" offset="6488883">There's nothing in the Immigration and Nationality Act or the implementing regulations that requires the Attorney General to surrender the finality of deportation orders as a condition permitting such motions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1935.788" offset="7888628">At the same time, however, Your Honor, Congress also recognized that there were important interests of recognition, and in the statute 1105a(a), which sets forth the exceptions to the Hobbs Act for judicial review in this context, that provides that the Attorney General can enforce a deportation order notwithstanding the availability of judicial review unless and until the alien in fact files for judicial review.</text>

            <text syncTime="3019.978" offset="12225372">So while we believe that the statute does recognize the existence of motions to reopen and reconsider, we again believe that it's within the... well within the Attorney General's authority to structure the administrative framework to define finality and to interpret that as motions not affecting that finality.</text>

            <text syncTime="3041.530" offset="12311576">So you're staying with the position that, despite Congress' recognition that there are such things as reopening applications, that the Attorney General can say, we're going to forget the whole business, making the statute addressing nothing, because there's nothing for it to address.</text>

            <text syncTime="3060.294" offset="12386600">Your Honor, our argument certainly doesn't rest on the authority to completely abolish those motions, although there is no express requirement of that in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.881" offset="12424948">But we do believe, as in the situation where... in Foti where the Attorney General had altered the administrative scheme to require that applications for suspension of deportation now be brought into deportation proceedings, that meant that the judicial review provisions for deportation proceedings now were the sole remedy, the sole avenue of judicial review for suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.028" offset="12525572">In that same way, we believe that it's well within the attorney general's discretion to set the limits on motions to reopen and reconsider.</text>

            <text syncTime="3111.539" offset="12591609">Mr. Chief Justice, you began by asking Ms. Brinkmann what is it that we are being asked to construe, and what is it she's asking deference to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.265" offset="12626509">Obviously, the regulations the Attorney General has issued can be construed and she can... the Attorney General may be entitled to some deference as to what her regulations mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.450" offset="12663289">I would agree with several members of the Court that these regulations don't say what the Government now says, but even if those regulations were explicit, in the end we are construing 1105 (a)(1), which is the provision for judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.230" offset="12722430">Ms. Brinkmann never mentioned the magic word Chevron here today, but I know of no case in which Chevron deference has been given to an administrative agency to construe away a right to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.582" offset="12779795">The only case the Government cites is Weinberger v. Salfi, and that case involved the question of not whether, but when.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.714" offset="12808321">That is, the question was whether the Government could require you to take it later rather than earlier, a totally different situation than what we have here, and indeed this Court in Cheng Fan Kwok, in Darby, in Lampf, and in other cases has specifically rejected the view of the Government as to when judicial review is available, because the whole theory of Chevron is that you give review deference to the agency in order for it to construe the statute under which it is operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.915" offset="12929111">The "it" here is the court of appeals that's operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.466" offset="12939351">The court of appeals doesn't get controlled by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.579" offset="12955756">After all, we have judicial review for the very purpose of checking Government action, and it would be odd, indeed, for the Congress to have said, we will give the Government deference in construing the jurisdiction of the court of appeals in a way that will adversely affect those who want to challenge Government action.</text>

            <text syncTime="3233.461" offset="13079263">The Government did not object to jurisdiction, did not object and said that they did not oppose the case coming into court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3250.363" offset="13146868">Mr. Morrison, are you saying that the Hobbs Act couldn't be interpreted either way?</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.234" offset="13162437">I mean, that was a case where the agency said, when we reconsider, it makes it nonfinal for purposes of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.810" offset="13184693">The ICC could not have said under that act, under our regime reconsideration does not stop the finality for purposes of review?</text>

            <text syncTime="3278.030" offset="13257627">I was interested to hear her statement that anyone could go read that decision and understand that it was permissive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.037" offset="13289601">I read it the other way around, that it was an interpretation of the Hobbs Act as to when judicial review was available or not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.582" offset="13315828">In my view, it would be an incorrect interpretation of the Hobbs Act and of the statute at issue here to conclude the opposite of what I've urged, but even if one could conclude the contrary, it would not be because of the Attorney General's deference, to which the Attorney General is due.</text>

            <text syncTime="3306.742" offset="13372461">But if she's right about what the statute means, that under the statute an agency can decide for itself whether its application for reconsider will stay the finality of its order for purposes of review, if she's right about that, then we do, we should defer to the agency's implementation of the Hobbs Act, if it can be implemented either way.</text>
