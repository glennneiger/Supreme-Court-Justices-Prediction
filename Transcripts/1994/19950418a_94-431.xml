            <text syncTime="9.517" offset="175990">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.519" offset="188007">Petitioner, James D. Ryder, was convicted at a general court martial of several offenses pursuant to Article 66 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.874" offset="225414">His case was then automatically appealed to the Coast Guard Court of Military Review.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.959" offset="245789">His case was heard there by three-judge panel consisting of two civilian military appellate judges and one active duty commissioned officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.325" offset="283197">During the course of that appeal, he raised as a contention that the judges of that court had not been appointed in accordance with the requirements of the Appointments Clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.853" offset="325306">The Court of Military Review rejected that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.125" offset="338367">The case was then reviewed further on discretionary appeal to the United States Court of Military Appeals, and the appointments issue was raised again by that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.400" offset="379536">The Court of Military Appeals rejected that contention on the grounds, or on the basis of its recent decision in the Carpenter case.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.805" offset="413078">In Carpenter, the Court of Military Appeals found that the civilian judges of the Coast Guard Court of Military Review had been improperly or unconstitutionally appointed, but affirmed their decision there anyway, saying only that just as the acts of the Federal Election Commissioners were accorded de facto validity in Buckley v. Valeo, we hold that the judicial acts of the civilian judges are entitled to de facto validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.732" offset="508790">The case is now here to address the question of what the effect of the unconstitutional appointments of these military appellate judges is on the decision in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.940" offset="553616">Everyone is in agreement, the Government has conceded, that the civilian judges of the Coast Guard court were unconstitutionally appointed, yet the Government then goes on to say nevertheless there should be no relief in this case under the de facto officer doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="182.211" offset="866772">The subsequent appointment by the Secretary of Transportation put the very same people back on the court who made the decision, and it's hard to construct any kind of harm to the petitioner here.</text>

            <text syncTime="227.029" offset="1045972">I can imagine some sort of harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.282" offset="1059034">Here, with an Article I situation, where the very same people are reappointed, it's very hard to understand what the harm might be.</text>

            <text syncTime="255.919" offset="1161538">That was also an Article I court.</text>

            <text syncTime="266.766" offset="1205006">A violation of the separation of powers is really an invitation to mischief, to prejudice arising, and furthermore, while this appeal to the Court of Military Review was automatic, it was by no means a pro forma appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="289.363" offset="1295389">Well now, at common law, an appointment-related challenge of the kind you're trying to make here as defense to a prosecution would not have been considered justiciable, would it?</text>
            <text syncTime="302.830" offset="1349202">It would have been limited to the bringing of quo warranto, or something of that kind, never allowed as a defense to a prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="318.060" offset="1410119">That has not been the view recently in the decisions of this Court, and the decision of the D.C. Circuit Court in the Federal Election Commission v. NRA Political Victory Fund--</text>

            <text syncTime="330.760" offset="1460901">But that may be, in fact, what's behind the de facto officer doctrine as such, the notion that when raised as the petitioner did here, it just isn't going to produce an overturning of the conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="347.499" offset="1527879">--Well, Your Honor, I think that's the question we're deciding here, whether it will, and we're not talking about an overturning of the conviction, basically an overturning of the appeal where the unconstitutionally appointed judges sat.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.070" offset="1594230">The de facto officer doctrine is really a rule of practicality designed to avoid chaos and mass disruption when a defect in an appointment is discovered long after the fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="391.968" offset="1705825">After all, you have no complaint about the court of first instance, and then there was a review at the third tier, a fully competent court, and the conviction was affirmed, so even if there's an infirmity at the second tier, why should it matter?</text>

            <text syncTime="1569.556" offset="6416121">This Court's 1993 decision in Harper v. The Virginia Department of Taxation recognized a distinction between retroactive application of a legal rule as a choice of law matter and remedial issues, a distinction previously discussed in opinions in the American Trucking and Jim Beam cases that were not subscribed to by a majority of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.499" offset="6551853">In those cases, the distinction was important because they involved invalid schemes of State taxation, and the remedial issues implicated questions of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.259" offset="6610890">Here, the distinction is important because the remedial issues implicate questions of remedial discretion of a Federal appellate court.</text>

I think what you're saying is that there is remedial discretion to give no remedy whatsoever, and therefore I don't see how you draw the distinction between prospectivity of remedy and prospectivity of vindication of right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1651.091" offset="6742234">There... in particular circumstances there can be occasions when a remedy is not appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.638" offset="6796464">I mean, the breadth of the remedial discretion of Federal appellate courts is actually something codified and recognized in a familiar provision of title 28 of the code, which was not cited heretofore in the case, but I would like to remind the Court of it, and I notified counsel of it yesterday when in preparation for this argument its relevance became apparent, and because it's not quoted in the papers I'll just read it briefly to the Court, title 21... section 2106 of title 28, and it's the ending that seems to us in context to have particular relevance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.060" offset="6986113">It says:</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.741" offset="6988829">"The Supreme Court or any other court of appellate jurisdiction. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.823" offset="7009205">--and that, presumably the Court of Military Appeals is any other court of appellate jurisdiction, but it codifies a principle whether that's true or not...</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.461" offset="7051732">"may affirm, modify, vacate, set aside, or reverse any judgment, decree or order of a court lawfully brought before it for review, and may remand the cause and direct the entry of such appropriate judgment, decree, or order, or require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.056" offset="7142116">And it seems to us that the rather clear implication is when there are reasons to conclude in the circumstances of a particular case that further proceedings would not be just under the circumstances, further proceedings need not as a remedial matter be ordered in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3029.373" offset="12255429">The problem with your approach is that in some situations it would lead us into confrontations with the executive, where the executive appoints someone who is a close friend, let's say, or one of the reasons for which you have an Appointments Clause, that there is indeed some problem, but you cannot say the individual appointed was incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.787" offset="12349052">All you can say is that the individual was, perhaps, one more favorable to the appointing officer than the Appointments Clause would have provided.</text>

            <text syncTime="3083.959" offset="12473708">The question before the Court is whether the Court of Military Appeals, when it resolved a question of first impression that was before that court, namely, that the principle of Weiss that a second commission was not needed cannot be extended to retired military officers, that the question is whether the circumstances that they were dealing with justified their remedial decision that these particular cases need not be reheard because of the circumstances in which they had been heard.</text>

I haven't read the whole Carpenter opinion, but in the part of it in your brief, the reason that they give for not extending it backwards, it says just as the acts of the FEC Commissioners were accorded de facto validity in Buckley v. Valeo, we hold that judicial acts of the chief judge are entitled to de facto validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.607" offset="12716333">Now, if that's the reason that they gave, then how can we know whether they would have given some other reason if they'd adopted your theory that you're arguing now?</text>

            <text syncTime="3153.433" offset="12751651">I think that it is properly looked at as an exercise of remedial discretion in that use of the Buckley case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.422" offset="12803582">In 1984, in a case that petitioner cites in the D.C. Circuit, an opinion that was joined by then Judge Ginsburg, called Andrade v. Lauer, the court of appeals there described Buckley the following way: the court's discussion of remedies in Buckley did advert to the need on prudential grounds to avoid interfering with past actions of the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.592" offset="12920297">The court's discussion, however, gives no indication that this was a matter of anything other than ordinary remedial discretion in a case involving reform of an entire institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.220" offset="12966795">The prospectivity that the Court adopted in Buckley for its relief, as it did in Cipriano v. City of Houma and in Northern Pipeline v. Marathon, was basically a remedial question rather similar in kind to other aspects of the Court's jurisprudence, where it has held that remedies are not rigid and mechanical, but are adaptable to the circumstances presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.531" offset="13103990">That's true in harmless error jurisprudence in the criminal area.</text>
