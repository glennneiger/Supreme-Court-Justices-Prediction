Valente as an example, where the Court had held that where there might be a compelling interest in the State to not violate the Establishment Clause, nonetheless the State has a duty to use mechanisms, mechanisms so as to preserve freedom of expression, mechanisms that are, to use the Court's language, closely fitted to the circumstances.</text>
