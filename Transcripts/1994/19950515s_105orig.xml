            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="86855">I have the opinion of the court to announce the number 105, the State of Kansas v. the State of Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.700" offset="117575">The Arkansas River rises on the east side of the Continental Divide in the Colorado mountains and flows at a steep gradient from its source south to Canon City, Colorado, whence it turns east and it flows to the Royal Gorge and then descends gradually through the high plains of Eastern Colorado and Western Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.914" offset="206496">It then makes a great bend northward through Kansas, then bend south again, flows through Oklahoma and Arkansas and empties into the Mississippi river for a length of 1450 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.700" offset="261562">This river is unique in one aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.629" offset="269294">Its pronunciation changes as it goes from State to State.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.516" offset="292909">When it rises in Colorado, it’s the Arkansas River; but when it flows through Kansas, it’s the Ar-KAN-sas River. Remember, when it goes through Oklahoma and Arkansas, it goes back to the Arkansas River.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.095" offset="343168">In 1949, Kansas and Colorado entered into a compact designed to apportion the waters of the Arkansas River.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.614" offset="373262">This original action involves the dispute among Kansas, Colorado and the United States over a claimed violations of the Arkansas River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.421" offset="412445">The Special Master we appointed has filed a report detailing his findings and recommendations regarding the alleged violations of the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.722" offset="445673">We agree with the Special Mater’s disposition of he disputed issues and we overrule Kansas and Colorado's exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.885" offset="474303">The opinion is unanimous.</text>
