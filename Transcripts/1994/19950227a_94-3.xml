            <text syncTime="351.299" offset="1542544">That is true, Justice Ginsburg, and what the majority went on to state was that Harper, their reading of Harper, allowed State courts to tailor their own remedy as they determine the manner in which a United States Supreme Court opinion was to be retroactively applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.806" offset="1632509">And what the majority's manner of tailoring in this case was, was to employ a provision of the Ohio constitution, Article I, section 16, and state that that prohibited the application of Bendix to the parties in this case, and specifically with regard to Article I and section 16, the majority stated,</text>
            <text syncTime="401.652" offset="1743896">"We find that when there is a conflict between a State constitutional civil right, Article I, section 16, and a Federal rule of decision, the Bendix case, that is not rooted in the Constitution, such as retroactivity, the civil right prevails. "</text>
            <text syncTime="420.927" offset="1821009">The rationale of the majority, in Part II of its decision, in denying full retroactivity to the parties in this case, is wrong, and that's been, I believe, so conceded by the respondent in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="460.671" offset="1980043">The respondent has conceded with the petitioners, we agree, that the clear command of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution displaces all conflicting State's law.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.472" offset="2043154">What is left, therefore, in this case to support the denial of full retroactivity of the Bendix decision is the logic of Part I of the majority's opinion, and whereas in Part II was premised upon the majority's reading of Harper, in Part I the court denied retroactivity by resort to a Chevron analysis, and again, that's clear because the court said,</text>
            <text syncTime="504.920" offset="2156944">"If Chevron remains good law, then Chevron, not Harper, provides the proper test to apply to the present case. "</text>
            <text syncTime="514.767" offset="2196336">Without quite saying so, I would submit that the majority had its doubts regarding the continued viability of a Chevron analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.183" offset="2234057">That's evidenced by statements in the majority's opinion that it is unclear whether Harper was intended to replace Chevron or supplement it: if Chevron remains good law, even if Chevron has been replaced by Harper, whether or not Chevron remains good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.066" offset="2313574">Despite what I believe were legitimate reservations about Chevron, the court nevertheless went ahead and did a Chevron analysis, and although the majority did not so state, I would submit that its resort to Chevron was solely in the context of a choice of law analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.241" offset="2402286">In other words, the new law or the old law.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.564" offset="2415556">The issue of remedy, the second prong of the court's opinion, was discussed in Part II.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.659" offset="2447948">In other words, when the court went on to say, Harper allows the courts to tailor their own remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.212" offset="2470204">Part I of the opinion, its Chevron inquiry, the term "remedy" was never mentioned by the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.266" offset="2502387">It never used the term, because I would submit the court viewed Chevron as a vehicle for determining choice of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.292" offset="2538436">Again, old law, resort to the continued use of the tolling statute, or new law, Bendix, 2305.15 is unconstitutional.</text>
