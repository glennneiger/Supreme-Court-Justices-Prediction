            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="13.799" offset="142052">This case comes to us on Writ of Certiorari to the Eight Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.015" offset="158874">Oklahoma taxes sales and transportation for hire when the sale is made within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.318" offset="184057">As with sales taxes generally, the buyer must pay the tax to the seller who then transfer collected tax over to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.139" offset="215403">In this case Jefferson Lines, a bus company refused to collect and pass along sales taxes on bus travel from Oklahoma to other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.855" offset="250199">Although it did collect and remit taxes to travel that began and ended within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.625" offset="273291">In the course of bankruptcy proceedings, the state start to recover the uncollected taxes, but Jefferson objected arguing that by taxing ticket sales at 4% regardless of whether the trip takes place wholly within Oklahoma, what takes a passenger out of state, Oklahoma was acting in violation of the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.625" offset="353330">Jefferson maintained that by taxing more than a portion of the ticket price that reflected travel within Oklahoma or itself, Oklahoma was taxing value derived from travel through other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.469" offset="400664">Jefferson further argued that the tax payer was thus place at the risk of multiple taxation because any other state through which the bus travels would be able to impose its own taxes upon Jefferson or its passengers for use of the roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.509" offset="456879">Jefferson relied for support on the case of Central Greyhound Lines, Inc. against Mealey, decided by this court in 1948 which struck down the tax on bus tickets by New York on much of the same grounds; although there the tax was collected not indirectly from the purchases but directly from the bus company.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.980" offset="538799">The Bankruptcy Court agreed with Jefferson, the District Court affirmed and so did the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.963" offset="562728">In an opinion filed with the clerk of court today, we reverse the judgment of the Eight Circuit and hold that Oklahoma’s tax does not violate the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.560" offset="601075">The sale of the transportation services here the payment for receipt of the ticket for present commencement of the trip because in one state alone, and is akin to the traditional sales transaction, which at least in the context of the sale of goods, we have long recognized as permitting a full sales tax to the buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.655" offset="673487">We therefore classify Oklahoma’s tax with taxes of sales generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.822" offset="694071">In so far as Central Greyhound points the other way, we find that it differs from Oklahoma’s sales tax and that the New York tax was placed directly on the seller and it was that feature which give rise the possibility of multiple taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.462" offset="752690">Here the tax falls on the buyer of the services who is no more subject to multiple taxation than the buyer of goods would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.414" offset="784455">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justice Thomas joins.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.115" offset="803263">Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice O’Connor joins.</text>
