            <text syncTime="68.006" offset="358867">The court below the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rejected both complaints on the ground that the Eleventh Amendment to the constitution shelter PATH and the Port Authority from suit in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.479" offset="432741">We granted review to resolve a conflict between the Second and Third Circuits on the question whether the Port Authority qualifies as a state agency eligible for Eleventh Amendment protection.</text>
