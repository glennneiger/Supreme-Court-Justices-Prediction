            <text syncTime="20.105" offset="229424">Alabama's capital sentencing scheme provides fo two decision-makers to determine sentence, a jury and a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.660" offset="263696">The legislature and the courts of Alabama have always said that the jury has a sentencing role to play.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.145" offset="289610">The Alabama code addresses both jury and judge with provisions on how to determine sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.721" offset="311866">The legislature intended that</text>
            <text syncTime="43.111" offset="321479">"juries play a major role in capital cases in Alabama. "</text>
            <text syncTime="46.435" offset="334749">as the Alabama supreme court noted in its landmark decision in Beck v. State.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.076" offset="349273">The court confirmed in Ex Parte Williams that tha role cannot count for nothing in Alabama's system, where the judge is the ultimate sentencing authority, following the jury's completion of its significant part.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.576" offset="403295">In Johnson v. State, the Court of Criminal Appeals said that an Alabama capital jury must be death qualified precisely because it plays a</text>
            <text syncTime="72.040" offset="437149">"key role in the sentencing process. "</text>
            <text syncTime="74.211" offset="445822">and despite the State's suggestion to the contrary in its brief, a trial court's rejection of a jury's advisory verdict is always understood and referred to in the case law as an override of that verdict.</text>

            <text syncTime="99.750" offset="548013">The Alabama supreme court has said consistently, actually, that Alabama is virtually identical to Florida in that it is a dual sentencing State.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.933" offset="580718">It does not have... the jury does not have final sentencing authority, but it is a constituent sentencer, as this Court has recognized in Espinosa that in Florida the jury is a constituent sentencer and Alabama has said that our system is virtually identical to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.582" offset="635367">And the Alabama courts have said repeatedly that the jury verdict and the capital sentencing jury has a very significant role to play, and that can be discerned from both the statutory provisions and the case law in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.582" offset="695344">The statutory provisions are addressed in 13A-5-46, for example, to the capital sentencing jury, on how it is to determine sentence, and that includes the weighing and consideration of aggravation in mitigation, the returning of a verdict only under certain circumstances... that is, when seven, at least 7 jurors vote that death is... life is the appropriate punishment, or 10 that death is the appropriate punishment, and if those numbers aren't reached, a new panel must be empaneled because that verdict would not have been reached by the first sentencer.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.924" offset="820731">The State's attempt in this case to transform the life without parole recommendation of this constituent sentencer into a fact in mitigation is inconsistent, thus, with the history and the logic of Alabama's capital sentencing scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="1210.315" offset="4990292">Because Alabama has created a dual sentencing system, that is why the advisory verdict rises to a certain level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.851" offset="5020385">It is true that, as Justice Ginsburg mentioned before, that the statute itself says this advisory verdict is an advisory verdict, it is a recommendation, it isn't binding, but because Alabama has created a second sentencer, that second sentencer is also subject to the Eighth Amendment, and because of that, Alabama has left a piece out of regulating the relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.765" offset="5104082">We are not saying that Alabama need make that advisory verdict binding on the trial court, but what it need do is regulate the relationship between the sentencers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.410" offset="5134697">When there is a disagreement between the sentencers, that second sentencer has no idea how to factor it in, and the problem that arises, as can be seen in the different orders of the trial courts, is that without some standard, without some guidance from the Alabama supreme court, they just don't even know what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.292" offset="5206168">They don't know how to make it part of the process at all, and therefore some treat it as a mitigating factor, some treat it as a prior judgment, some try and weigh it into the balance, even though they're not treating it as a mitigating factor, and some have a variety of legal standards under which to reject or accept that verdict.</text>

            <text syncTime="1294.762" offset="5328108">First of all, what the Alabama supreme court does in its discussion of reweighing is never addressed, what the jury's role was in the process, and that's certainly what happened in Mrs. Harris' case, and secondly, Alabama does not reweigh aggravation and mitigation in the way that this Court has understood that term in cases such as Clemons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.435" offset="5402713">It has said specifically in Longhorn v. State that it does not reweigh, and if there are errors below, that sentence is sent back to the trial court for the trial court to impose sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1338.791" offset="5504173">But what it does not do is address part of the process that happened below, which is, because the judge was required to do more than consider aggravation and mitigation, but also to make that jury verdict a part of the process, which is mandated by statute, the appellate review is insufficient because it does not review what actually happened below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.162" offset="5577629">And as to reweighing, the Alabama appellate courts do not do that in the traditional way that this court understands reweighing to take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.150" offset="5621620">And as I mentioned before, in cases such as Espinosa, or in cases such as Gardner v.

            <text syncTime="1385.121" offset="5689538">This Court has said, in cases going as far back as Gregg, that the Eighth Amendment limits the discretion of the sentencers to minimize the risk of arbitrary action, and what we have in this case is arbitrary action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.240" offset="5749933">Because Alabama has required that two sentencers be involved in this process, it creates, without some connection between them, the risk of arbitrariness because there is no standard for that second sentencer to--</text>

            <text syncTime="1635.863" offset="6692431">In Espinosa v. Florida, this Court upheld Florida's capital murderers sentencing scheme which also included a jury override provision.</text>
