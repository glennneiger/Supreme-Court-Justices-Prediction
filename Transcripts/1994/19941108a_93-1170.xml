            <text syncTime="10.158" offset="190269">Mr. Bender.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul Bender</label>
            <text syncTime="11.089" offset="194031">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.562" offset="207928">This case concerns the constitutionality of the honorarium provision contained in the Federal Ethics Reform Act of 1989, a provision that prohibits Federal employees in all three branches of Government from accepting compensation beyond ordinary and necessary travel expenses for making appearances, giving speeches, or writing articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.809" offset="308865">Regulations of honoraria of this kind for these same activities have been part of Federal statutory law since the mid-1970's.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.674" offset="348362">In 1974, Congress imposed a... not a total ban, but a monetary limit on the amount that Federal employees could be paid in honoraria.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.152" offset="398308">It was $1,000 per appearance and a $15,000 annual limit that was later raised to $2,000 per appearance and a $25,000 annual limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.581" offset="443970">In 1981, the annual limit was removed, but the $2,000 limit remained.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.656" offset="464346">In the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, Congress decided to, instead of dealing with this by putting a monetary limit on the amount that a Federal employee could obtain through honoraria for these activities, to eliminate them altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.918" offset="533309">It did this on the advice of two Federal Commissions, one the Quadrennial Commission, which makes periodic reports and gives advice on Federal salaries, and the other an ethics commission, Ethics in Federal Government Commission, appointed by President Bush in the last 1980's.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.303" offset="614916">Both of those commissions recommended that the policy be changed from a limit on the amount of honoraria to total prohibition of Federal employees in all three branches obtaining honoraria.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.991" offset="669668">Congress did this, as well, in light of very strong public concern about the use of honoraria for those activities as a way of steering compensation to Federal employees who might have, when the person steering the compensation might have some reason to want some favors or special treatment from the Federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.572" offset="775934">That had been most prominent with regard to Members of Congress and congressional staffs, but the commissions recommended, and Congress followed their advice, that it made sense to apply the ban across the board and not just to limit it to the legislative branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.125" offset="842181">Initially, it did not apply to the Senate, or Senate staff members, and in response to that, the Senate decided not to take a pay raise that went to the House at that time, but a couple of years later, the Senate voted itself into the ban, it and its staff, so that the ban now applies to all Federal employees in all three branches of Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.090" offset="942073">Mr. Bender, in the definitions section, 505(3), which defines the term, honorarium, apparently it was amended to add some parenthetical material so that it now provides...</text>
            <text syncTime="221.528" offset="1035800">"the term, honorarium, means a payment of money or anything of value for an appearance, speech, or article, including a series of appearances, speeches, or articles, if the subject matter is directly related to the individual's official duties, et cetera.

            <text syncTime="247.346" offset="1139036">It seems to provide, as it's written, that a person can't get an honorarium for a single speech or article, but can if the person gets several, and I just don't understand what we do with a provision like that.</text>

            <text syncTime="284.001" offset="1285636">You mean, you think that it was intended to, as structured with the other provisions of the statute, to prohibit an honorarium if it's a single speech or article, but to allow it if there are several?</text>

            <text syncTime="298.030" offset="1341747">--Yes, I think that's the clear intention, because at the time in Congress there was a proposal to apply the nexus requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.718" offset="1376542">That is, which says that the honorarium is prohibited only if it's directly related to the official's... to the individual's official duties, or payment is made because of the individual's status with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.113" offset="1418129">There was a proposal in the Senate to apply that to the whole definition, and that failed, and instead this was put in.</text>

            <text syncTime="336.706" offset="1496496">Well, I think the difference is that first of all the reason they did that was that the statute, as originally written... if you just leave out the parenthesis, you will see how it was originally written.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.852" offset="1533067">It says, for an appearance, speech, or article, and there was confusion about whether the statute would apply to a series, because it was stated in the singular, and this was put in to make it clear that it did apply to a series, because that wasn't clear before.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.372" offset="1595134">The difference, I think, between a series and an individual speech can be seen if you think about the reason for the prohibition in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="378.225" offset="1662530">The problem with honoraria is that they can be paid for relatively little or no work.</text>

            <text syncTime="397.711" offset="1740480">Those are the things that the statute meant to stop, payment for things that could be used to transfer payment to Government officials who really didn't earn the money.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gregory O'Duden</label>
            <text syncTime="1823.908" offset="7445309">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.002" offset="7473730">In its brief, the Government has offered three main justifications for the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.187" offset="7502465">It has said that it is needed to guard against the appearance of impropriety, it has argued that this is a needed prophylactic measure, and it has also said that there are administrative reasons that justify the existence of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.338" offset="7571010">Much of the discussion this morning has focused on the last justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.931" offset="7593371">If I understand the Government correctly, it is agreeing that there is no appearance of impropriety when a career employee writes or speaks about something that has no connection to his job, and where the payor has no interest pending before the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.014" offset="7673724">But what the Justice Department seems to argue this morning is that even if that's the case, it's just too hard to enforce a nexus requirement, and with all respect to the Justice Department, I believe that that argument is just a bit thin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.566" offset="7743941">As we know, as Justice O'Connor has pointed out, the Achilles heel in each of the... with respect to each of the justifications here is the fact that an employee can receive compensation if he or she writes a series of articles, and, of course, what that means with respect to the statute is, you can't be paid if you write one or two articles, but if you repackage it as three or more, then you can be paid, provided there is no nexus to employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.126" offset="7866194">It seems to us that the fact that there is a nexus test written right in the statute is very good evidence that a nexus test is eminently manageable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.455" offset="7923454">The question was raised earlier, what concrete experience do we have as to how much of a burden it is to administer a nexus requirement?</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.691" offset="7964414">Well, we would point the Court to a report that the Government believes, at least in its brief, supports its position, and I'm speaking here about the GAO report, which, of course, covered a 3-year period and examined outside activities that were engaged in by Federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.304" offset="8042886">And if I read the report correctly, and added up the numbers correctly, there were about 2,500 employees who had received approval to engage in outside activities, the report identifies two instances where there were arguable improprieties with respect to the speaking activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.480" offset="8127627">So in essence, what the report has said is that out of 2,500 occasions, there were two concrete instances of an arguable abuse, and of course--</text>

            <text syncTime="2023.638" offset="8244238">Mr. O'Duden, what troubles me about your proposal that it just be limited to things that have what you call a nexus is that it's a different problem from what... I mean, that's a good idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.320" offset="8306932">It might be a nice statute, but there are two really quite separate problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.152" offset="8322292">One is the problem of an employee trading on the expertise he's acquired in the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.176" offset="8346429">That is one problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.108" offset="8350086">A quite separate problem is the problem of the employee getting paid by someone outside the Government for talking about, you know, really for the benefit that he could do to somebody outside the Government but disguising it under, you know, a speech or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.871" offset="8421139">It's usually disguised under a speech, is what the Government says, and therefore Congress chose to address that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.454" offset="8447471">That's a totally separate problem from the problem of trading on your Government expertness, so why should we substitute the one statute for the other?</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.681" offset="8484356">It's a different statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2095.750" offset="8532630">It's not clear to me why that same notion that when a Federal employee speaks about something that has nothing to do with his job, would not also raise that same concern in that situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2128.901" offset="8665227">As I understand the Government's argument, it is suggesting that the added volume of material somehow makes it easier to determine a nexus, and I think as Justice Ginsburg noted earlier, that, I think, lacks a rational basis, because someone could easily write a very long, very voluminous, single article with ample material in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.549" offset="8775882">Someone could write, on the other hand, three very short articles.</text>

Glines, and the court of appeals... the court of appeals recognized that the starting point with respect to the proper standard is, of course, this Court's decision in Pickering, where the basic general question is whether the Government's interest in efficiency outweighs the employee's interest in speaking freely on matters of public concern.</text>
