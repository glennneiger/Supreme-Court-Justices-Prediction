            <text syncTime="57.919" offset="381061">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="62.160" offset="397988">The issues in this case involve the standard for determining a colorable claim that the wrong person has been convicted of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.557" offset="435605">Mr. Schlup's case is an extraordinary case in which the system of justice broke down and produced a fundamental miscarriage of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.665" offset="467996">The facts of this case reveal the need for the miscarriage of justice safety valve.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.847" offset="488790">It is our position that a standard that does not reach Mr. Schlup's case is incapable of protecting the innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.950" offset="517107">There are certain facts, objective facts, in this case that both sides must accept, have accepted since the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.497" offset="547304">The victim in this case, Arthur Dade, was stabbed in the Missouri State Penitentiary in a housing unit shortly after all of the prisoners were released to lunch.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.003" offset="585338">A surveillance video shows that Mr. Schlup was the first inmate to enter the dining room, which is 150 yards, three floors, and at least one security checkpoint away from the scene of the crime, and a minute and 5 seconds after Mr. Schlup enters the dining room, the guards are seen responding to a radio distress call.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.687" offset="676140">Now, at trial, in order to prove Mr. Schlup's guilt, the State had to do two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.402" offset="698919">First, it had to show a substantial delay between the homicide and the radio distress call, and the second thing it had to show was that Mr. Schlup raced past everyone else to cut in line, the head of the line for lunch, and there is now strong, uncontradicted evidence that now rebuts both of those propositions, and this evidence is also corroborated by other direct, circumstantial, and scientific evidence that Mr. Schlup was not involved in the crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="232.844" offset="1080725">The false assumption is that Eberle was the only person who could have made that call because the radio was the only way out of the housing unit, and in fact there was a telephone that has a speed dial number keyed in right to the control center within 15 feet of where the victim collapsed.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3216.180" offset="13014086">I certainly am not aware of any.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.422" offset="13018997">--that you're about to make, so just the... my understanding of this, and correct me if I'm wrong... I may well be wrong, but my understanding of this is that we're talking about a person in general who has some kind of a claim that his trial was unconstitutional or held in violation of the laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.179" offset="13126099">He's already had one habeas proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.341" offset="13138743">Now he comes to a second, a third, or a fourth, and normally it involves a claim that wasn't made at the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.166" offset="13169985">It could involve a claim that was, in which case it would be a successor, but it involves a claim that wasn't made at the first proceeding, and so the obvious question is, why didn't you make it before?</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.452" offset="13207183">And he has to have a very good answer to that, really a very good answer, or we won't even listen to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.547" offset="13231529">But there's an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.207" offset="13238217">The exception to his having a very good answer, maybe it's only a fairly good answer, but not a--</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.271" offset="13262458">The exception is if you really think there was a miscarriage of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.663" offset="13276042">Now, what's that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.423" offset="13283043">And my reading of it is what Henry Friendly said is... well, what that is, is if the trier of fact... I'm the habeas judge, imagine... if the trier of fact would have entertained a reasonable doubt of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.323" offset="13342602">That's what Henry Friendly once said the judge should ask himself, and I take it Kuhlmann basically picked that up, not using exactly those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.872" offset="13384816">And then, if you're going to use that standard, I'll tell you one variety of miscarriage of justice, if you, judge, sitting there, think that the trier of fact at the trial had seen all this evidence he would have found a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.800" offset="13444584">Now, that's basically the Kuhlmann standard, and they say they've met it in this very unusual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.805" offset="13468617">Henry Friendly said, believe me, those cases are few and far between.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.137" offset="13485858">Having sat in a court of appeals, I would agree, and I hope they're very far between, but they say they've got one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.671" offset="13512085">All right, my question is, we're talking about an exception that comes up rarely, why do you need a tougher standard than that, that the judge should sit there, ask himself conscientiously, with all this stuff in here, all the evidence, would that trier of fact have had a reasonable doubt, would have, not some theoretical speculation?</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.018" offset="13609469">If I believe the answer to that question is yes, I should at least listen to the constitutional claim, and my statement of it may be wrong, in which case, correct me, but if not, then what is the answer to that?</text>

            <text syncTime="3403.425" offset="13763069">He talked about the explosion of habeas in that University of Chicago Law Review article talking about as many as 400 or 500 cases Nationwide in a year at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.441" offset="13795147">And in this case, it's not, it's a successive, or we're later on in the process, and plus, Your Honor, I just deeply believe that the fair probability standard that has been written in Kuhlmann, as the interpretation of what Friendly's colorable showing, an entertaining, is far too imprecise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.182" offset="13870067">It mirrors the Strickland test, it mirrors the new trial test, it doesn't penalize later claims, and it doesn't set a line for trial courts and appellate courts to make these decisions, and thus, I think it makes problems, and I believe that it doesn't do what it's designed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.223" offset="13934223">Maybe if it's the first one, it makes more sense.</text>
