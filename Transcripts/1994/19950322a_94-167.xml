            <text syncTime="20.663" offset="238106">That is, whether or not the Attorney General's scope of employment certification issued under the Westfall Act is subject to de novo judicial review by the district court.</text>

            <text syncTime="69.186" offset="432144">We opposed that motion in the district court, however, based on the Fourth Circuit's ruling in Johnson v. Carter, that held that there was no discretion on the part of the district court but to dismiss the action and substitute the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="874.113" offset="3651893">The position of the United States is that under the Westfall Act, the Attorney General's scope certification is subject to review by a court at the behest of a tort plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.097" offset="3683762">The large majority of courts of appeals to have addressed the question have also concluded that the scope certification is subject to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.772" offset="3710511">That view is consistent with the text of the Westfall Act and with the strong presumption that administrative action is judicially reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.666" offset="3738097">Moreover, to permit judicial review of the Attorney General's scope certification does not render the Act susceptible to a challenge based on Article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.892" offset="3766936">First, the text of the Act does not definitively resolve the interpretive question that this case presents.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.905" offset="3791073">Respondent, in his amicus, placed principal reliance on the statute's use of the word "shall".</text>
            <text syncTime="914.279" offset="3812493">And in Johnson v. Carter, the predecessor Fourth Circuit case to this one, the Fourth Circuit also concluded that the word "shall" reflected an unambiguous congressional intent to preclude review of the certification.</text>

            <text syncTime="2347.444" offset="9545222">The only part of the language or structure of the Westfall Act that the Government is able to rely on at all to try to undermine the mandatory language of the statute is subsection (d)(2), which says that certification shall be conclusive for purposes of removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.566" offset="9617633">The United States tries to argue that the implication of that provision is that it's not conclusive for purposes of substitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.153" offset="9648039">There are several reasons why that implication doesn't hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.074" offset="9659742">First of all, as Mr. Maloney pointed out, it does not change the mandatory language used in the rest of the statute that says the United States shall be substituted, period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.939" offset="9699135">The only condition precedent for substitution listed in the statute is certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.104" offset="9723795">It's the only event that the district court is charged with determining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.476" offset="9737274">The second reason the implication doesn't hold is that it's counterbalanced by subsection (d)(3), which says that if the Attorney General does not certify, then the plaintiff can seek a certification from the court that he was in fact acting within the scope of the employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2435.293" offset="9896621">Then the defendant petitions for certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.555" offset="9909577">The United States then removes the case to Federal court under (d)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.048" offset="9927550">And a Federal court judge will make that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.590" offset="9937790">And then, if he rules against the defendant... says he was acting outside the scope of employment... the case is remanded to State court.</text>
