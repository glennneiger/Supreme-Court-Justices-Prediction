            <text syncTime="55.468" offset="371388">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="57.937" offset="381210">The primary issue in this case is whether the courts should give normal deference to an arbitration decision on the issue of arbitrability when the objecting party asks the arbitrators to decide that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.577" offset="423842">First Options filed claims against MK Investments, its president and sole shareholder, Manuel Kaplan, and his wife, Carol Kaplan.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.266" offset="458532">There was no dispute as to the arbitrability of the claims against MK Investments, but the Kaplans objected to the arbitrability of the claims against them individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.189" offset="494268">They withdrew those objections at a prehearing conference, but 2 years later, they filed a motion stating that the arbitrators had not yet ruled on their objections, and asking the panel for a ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.545" offset="535646">Their motion included a detailed memorandum of law addressing all of the bases for arbitrability asserted by First Options.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.983" offset="565425">The arbitration panel gave the issue full consideration, and ruled that the claims against the Kaplans individually were arbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.387" offset="595100">Respondents' arguments cannot diminish the fact that they asked for and received the arbitrator's ruling on the arbitrability issue, so the question is whether such a ruling, like rulings on other issues submitted to arbitration, is entitled to deference, or must be reviewed by courts de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.050" offset="669706">Although parties are clearly entitled to an initial judicial determination of arbitrability, this Court's decisions in AT&amp;T Technologies and Warrior &amp; Gulf make it equally clear that the parties can submit the arbitrability issue to the arbitrators instead.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.410" offset="739192">Now, respondents agree that if the parties formally agree to submit the arbitrability issue to the arbitrators for a conclusive determination, deferential review may well be appropriate, but they apparently believe that deference is due only if the parties enter into a formal written agreement or stipulation to have the arbitrators finally decide that issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="204.449" offset="967293">It seems to me what your case comes down to is that whenever you choose to litigate jurisdiction before the arbitrator, you have automatically conceded that whatever the arbitrator says goes, and I don't see that that follows.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.110" offset="1133954">In AT&amp;T Technologies in particular, the question was whether the parties... the issue that was raised by the dictum in that case was whether the parties had clearly and unmistakable agreed to submit the arbitrability issue to the arbitrators, but it's important to keep in mind that in that case the issue came up in the first instance in the courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="304.962" offset="1369370">There have been a number of courts that have said that in all situations there will be judicial review on a de novo basis of arbitrability determinations, but the Third Circuit wasn't one of those courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.920" offset="1413151">In at least four cases that I know of, the United Industrial Workers case, the Yorkaire case, which was a district court decision affirmed by the Third Circuit, Pennsylvania Power, and a case called GK Management, the Third Circuit took our position and said that when the arbitrators argue the issue of arbitrability, when the parties argue the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrators, the arbitrators' determination is entitled to deference, so the issue is quite up in the air in the Third Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3197.484" offset="12939420">The issue there was whether the courts could compel a party to submit a dispute to arbitration without first determining that the party had agreed to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.273" offset="12978604">As the Court put it in John Wiley, a compulsory submission to arbitration cannot precede a judicial determination because a party can't be compelled to arbitrate if arbitration does not bind it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.731" offset="13024475">Nobody compelled the Kaplans to submit their arbitrability objections to the arbitrator in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.069" offset="13049762">They asked the arbitration panel to rule on arbitrability, and having done so, they're bound by the result, and the only question that really is before this Court is whether their act of submission constitutes an agreement to submit that issue and have it considered in a binding way by the arbitrators.</text>

            <text syncTime="3246.834" offset="13136802">The issue is in fact that if they... to preserve that, they must get into a Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.171" offset="13166163">As Mr. Roberts pointed out, the case could wash in many ways before the arbitrators, so the issue... there would never have to be any Federal litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3263.177" offset="13202212">If they want to do that, if they want to preserve judicial review de novo, they have to get the court to do it initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.598" offset="13223946">Now, perhaps I'm wrong about saying the George Day rule is wrong, and that we should have an initial objection, and that should suffice, but that's not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.187" offset="13254248">There's no initial objection here, there was actual submission, so that wouldn't determine the outcome of the case and shouldn't be decided here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.023" offset="13281625">I think the notion that there's some special magic to going to court and getting a de novo review is a manifestation of the old hostility to arbitration.</text>
