            <text syncTime="17.176" offset="217352">This case presents the question whether Federal banking law permits national banks to act as agents in the sale of annuities.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.298" offset="249848">The Comptroller of the Currency, who has supervisory authority over the national banking system, based his conclusion that it does on three determinations, each grounded in his technical and policy expertise: first, that banks are authorized to broker financial investments on behalf of their customers, second, that modern annuity contracts are essentially investment products, and third, that nothing in 12 U.S. Code section 92, which authorizes banks operating in small towns to operate general insurance agencies, prohibits sales of annuities by banks located elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.705" offset="387461">The court of appeals erred by failing to defer to the Comptroller on each of these judgements.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.792" offset="415778">The general banking power statute, 12 U.S. Code section 24 Seventh, provides at the outset that national banks may exercise</text>
            <text syncTime="74.363" offset="446080">"all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking. "</text>
            <text syncTime="79.750" offset="467605">Defining what is part of the business of banking at any given time requires an intimate understanding of a highly dynamic field.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.105" offset="497071">It is therefore a task uniquely within the competence of the Comptroller.</text>

            <text syncTime="126.563" offset="654851">Should we not look to the six specific things and see if something is closely related to those?</text>

            <text syncTime="741.099" offset="3113078">We have a very different context here, which is a statute which simply confers some authority to deal in a broad range of insurance products on banks and small towns.</text>

            <text syncTime="1782.938" offset="7280444">I'd like to start by talking about the pooling question that was just being discussed here by Mr. Rosenthal, because it seems to us very critical here to understand the nature of insurance, because the Comptroller misstated in his definition of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.115" offset="7333107">He said that insurance is indemnification against risk of loss, and that is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.817" offset="7347944">That is a description of casualty insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.935" offset="7356408">Life insurance and annuities are insurance, but they do not involve indemnification against risk of loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.588" offset="7383053">The elements of insurance are, in fact, pooling and sharing of risk, which Mr. Rosenthal said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.390" offset="7402175">That's what this Court has said in the McCarran-Ferguson cases in trying to construe the term, the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.361" offset="7422132">If you take a life insurance situation, the people who buy the life insurance are insuring against the loss of income due to death for the benefit of their dependents, and the people who die... let's make sure I get this correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.288" offset="7473750">The people who die early are subsidized by the premiums paid by the people who die late.</text>

            <text syncTime="1868.456" offset="7622439">Yes, but that... but isn't that the crucial point, really, which makes us not like insurance?</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.241" offset="7637590">I mean, I would have thought that insurance in its heartland concept is a group of people in this room get together and they think something bad might happen to them, and they say, if something bad's going to happen to us, at least we'll get some money, and so what they're doing is, they're worried about a risk of bad things that are going to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.018" offset="7704673">They're called risk-averse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.402" offset="7710211">So they put up some money now, a little bit, and then if something bad happens they get a lot more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.189" offset="7729437">That helps them feel better, all right, or other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.475" offset="7742602">This isn't that at all from the insurance company's point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.177" offset="7757335">Maybe you measure it and decide what the price is going to be, because you take life into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.514" offset="7778756">That's a decision as to what you're going to charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.116" offset="7789100">But what the person's buying is not some protection against some bad thing happening to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.151" offset="7809267">He's buying an income stream that happens to be measured by his life, just as if he bought a coupon, a bond, or some other thing, or a black acre for his life, or a condominium in Florida for his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.393" offset="7858273">I mean, it seems to me that's a rather heartland difference, even though I absolutely concede that insurance companies sell this kind of thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2072.389" offset="8438191">So Congress clearly was thinking of a life insurance company as selling insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.007" offset="8456686">That's right in the text of the statute, that the national bank in a small town is permitted to sell insurance as agent for a fire, life, or other insurance company, so although this may be a theoretical possibility, I don't think it's in the context of this case available as an outcome.</text>

            <text syncTime="3018.242" offset="12221662">In fact, the Comptroller said insurance was an outside business naturally belonging to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.646" offset="12243187">Now, he then asked for a statute to be enacted to allow the banks and small towns, national banks and small towns to exercise these powers, and specifically he specified that it would be unwise and undesirable to give it to the banks in larger towns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.072" offset="12300970">This sequence, it seems to us, is very powerful, because the Comptroller is saying that in 1990 he's all of a sudden discovered that back in 1863 that statute actually authorized insurance sales and annuity insurance... sales of annuities all along, and I think that renders the entire sequence in 1915 and 1916 really--</text>
