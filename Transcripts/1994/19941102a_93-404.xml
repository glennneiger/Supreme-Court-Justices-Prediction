            <text syncTime="19.571" offset="223651">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="25.131" offset="245907">As the briefs indicate, this case turns in large part on whether or not the phrase, by means of a prospectus or oral communication, as used in section 12(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, is a phrase of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.766" offset="308392">The case also turns on whether, by section 12(2), the act covers negotiated private transactions even though the act does not otherwise intrude into such business arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.604" offset="363772">The House report answers both these questions, stating the bill affects only new offerings of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.490" offset="395328">It does not affect ordinary redistribution of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.583" offset="411628">As to liability provisions, the report states the bill's civil liabilities attach only when there's been an untrue statement of material fact in the registration statement or the prospectus, the basic information on which the public is solicited.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.264" offset="478397">This case involves no new offering of securities, and presents the paradigm example of a private transaction the act plainly left free from regulation other than by its section 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.009" offset="529388">Art Gustafson, Dan McLean, and Francis Butler sold their company to a sophisticated investor which conducted its own due diligence and negotiated the deal it wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.128" offset="573796">The buyers had full access to information about Alloyd.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.221" offset="594172">Indeed, Mr. McLean and Mr. Butler were officers and shareholders of the buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.593" offset="615697">The stock purchase agreement contained numerous riskallocating provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.217" offset="638162">In particular, the parties knew that Alloyd's interim earnings were estimated, so, as is common, they closed with an estimated purchase price subject to a later dollar for dollar adjustment after an audit determined actual earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.288" offset="706498">They plainly could have, but did not, agree that some multiple of the variance should apply to the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.862" offset="736800">After the audit, the parties agreed that the estimated price had been 815,000 dollars too high, and sellers paid that amount to buyers as the agreement required.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.545" offset="775566">Buyers, who knew Alloyd's interim earnings were estimated, now claim that sellers warranted a certain level of such earnings in the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.730" offset="816212">They claim a breach of that warranty, which is a contract law matter, and also claim a violation of section 2 of the... 12(2) of the Securities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.038" offset="857486">They have made no claim of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.068" offset="865636">As to the section 12(2) claim they assert, it is that the purchase agreement itself, the negotiated purchase agreement, was a prospectus, and they claim they are entitled to rely on oral communications during due diligence about Alloyd's inventory, even though the agreement specifically provided such oral statements were superseded by the terms of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.777" offset="968454">Buyers seek rescission of the transaction or rescissionary damages, even though by the agreement they agreed that they would not seek rescission.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.148" offset="1001891">The act, and section 12(2) in particular, makes a seller, we submit, a fiduciary only when there is an initial public offering of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.002" offset="1049329">It does not do so in the context of ordinary secondary transactions such as privately negotiated resales of stock that have never been publicly distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.076" offset="1093633">A stock purchase agreement memorializing the terms of a negotiated deal is not a prospectus, nor are discussions in the course of due diligence regarding the reliability of inventory estimates.</text>

            <text syncTime="269.641" offset="1223932">It specifically uses that phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.717" offset="1232186">But the preceding words in 2(10) is, the very first definition of prospectus is prospectus itself, which as commonly defined then had a public solicitation connotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.385" offset="1278893">We believe the correct interpretation, as demonstrated by numerous portions of the House report and other commentary by draftsman, is, an offering circular is a prospectus when it's used to solicit the public to purchase securities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1804.693" offset="7364066">One, this statute was basically walking into new territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.895" offset="7384964">There had not been significant regulation of the securities industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.658" offset="7403981">I think it is reasonable for Congress to have started with some terms that were known and commonly used, prospectus, circular, notice, and then worked from that in increasing breadth, ending with the term, written communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.825" offset="7456644">Could they have simply said any communication, or any written communication?</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.871" offset="7468869">They certainly could have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.713" offset="7476183">I think a second explanation is that, as pointed out in the Solicitor General's brief, we know that the draftsmen started with the British Companies Act as a model, and the British Companies Act has a definition of prospectus that starts out similarly to the definition of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.832" offset="7536683">However, in this case the drafters diverted significantly, because the British Companies Act referred to public offerings of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.908" offset="7564999">That was eliminated from the definition of prospectus by the Congress that enacted the '33 act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2208.641" offset="8979896">One is that the language of section 12(2) simply does not expressly impose the limitation that petitioners are asking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.341" offset="9014691">Second, the other provisions of the act demonstrate that when Congress meant to exempt either a particular type of transaction or particular type of security from some portion of the act it did so explicitly, and we've talked about, during Mr. Jenkins' argument, sections 4(2), 4(1), which create express exemptions from the registration requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.473" offset="9099223">There's no comparable exemption from section 12(2) and, further, again as Mr. Jenkins pointed out, when Congress meant to exempt a particular type of security from section 12(2), it did that explicitly as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.264" offset="9146348">So when Congress meant there to be exemptions, it enacted them.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="2253.575" offset="9159618">Does... Justice Breyer asked you whether one aspect of the definition of prospectus is carried over into the phrase, oral communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.085" offset="9221685">What about the aspect that requires a prospectus to be in connection with the offer to sell, in connection with the offer or confirmation of sale?</text>

            <text syncTime="2291.857" offset="9312800">I believe it is, Your Honor, by the bymeansof language in section 12(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.902" offset="9332967">I think to say that a particular security is sold by means of either a written or oral communication means that that statement is made in connection with the solicitation of the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.711" offset="9376226">I think the whole purpose of section 12(2) was to focus in on that process by which sellers solicit buyers, and the focus of the bymeansof clause I believe is to hone it right in on just that, those statements, whether oral or written, that are used to solicit sales of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.904" offset="9456996">I want to return to just one other point in the text of section 12(2) itself, if I may, and that's the term, oral communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.713" offset="9504226">This Court has said repeatedly, and most recently in FDIC v. Meyer, that undefined statutory terms are to be given their ordinary, or natural meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.147" offset="9545917">Now, petitioners cannot dispute that giving the words of the statute their ordinary meaning, section 12(2) on its face unambiguously applies to any security sold by means of a false or misleading oral communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.610" offset="9603804">There simply is no connotation you can give to oral communication that limits it to a public offering or an initial offering of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.371" offset="9634838">To the contrary, an oral communication is going to occur most often in the context of a private transaction, a negotiated transaction where people are talking to each other, so oral communication, it seems, if you read it just in its natural sense, clearly applies to all transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.600" offset="9691785">Now, they say you can't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.491" offset="9699308">You have to look to prospectus as a term of limitation on oral communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.895" offset="9720937">It seems to me that what they're asking you to do is take a term that we think is unambiguously defined... that is, prospectus... find some ambiguity in that, construe it narrowly, and then use that to narrow a clearly broad term.</text>

            <text syncTime="2669.767" offset="10824454">In our view, the cause of action provided in section 12(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 does extend to all sales of securities made by means of a prospectus or oral communication that contains a misleading statement, and there is no limitation to initial offerings, initial public offerings, or an exclusion of private transactions or secondary transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.258" offset="10922361">The key in construing section 12(2) is the phrase, prospectus or oral communication, which is a defined term in the act, and when one looks at the definition in section 2(10) of the prospectus, it's fairly clear that Congress used words that cover a very, very broad range of kinds of communications that offer a security for sale or confirm the sale of a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.998" offset="11025284">And as my cocounsel alluded to, the origins of the statutory definition of prospectus are very revealing, because they show that the first four terms in that definition are the same that appear in the British Companies Act, and there is evidence from the people who wrote this act that they used the British Companies Act as a model.</text>

            <text syncTime="2740.473" offset="11107204">Mr. Dreeben, how do you answer Justice Kennedy's question about section 10, which uses the word, a prospectus, but that is definitely the kind of prospectus that would be part of a registration statement?</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.061" offset="11165613">There, the word prospectus does have a circumscribed meaning.</text>

            <text syncTime="2760.261" offset="11186407">Well, for most of section 10, that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.275" offset="11198423">Section 10 is by and large concerned with the kind of formal prospectus that's included with a registration statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.586" offset="11223710">There is also authority for the Commission later in section 10 to classify various prospectuses according to type, and that is not a limitation that would necessarily apply to prospectuses filed in a registration statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.113" offset="11277835">But I think the most important point here is that the structure of the acts, the securities laws as a whole, reflects that Congress understood the difference between the broad definition in section 2(10) and the narrower association of prospectus used in a registration statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.888" offset="11336872">In the Investment Companies Act of 1940, Congress included a definition of prospectus that says, prospectus for certain sections of the act means the prospectus that is described in section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.507" offset="11395386">Elsewhere, it has the definition that is contained in section 2(10) of the Securities Act of 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.832" offset="11424644">So Congress itself was fully capable of drawing that distinction, and the act itself invites courts to draw appropriate distinctions in--</text>

Felix Frankfurter was at the time very heavily involved in the drafting process... and those articles asserted without qualification that section 12(2) applied to any sale of securities and wanted to educate the investment community that was concerned with this that that was true.</text>

            <text syncTime="3253.127" offset="13157816">The fundamental issue here is whether, when everybody says the '33 act was following the British act, which only applied to public offerings, did Congress somehow in the process, by section 12(2), totally convert the '33 act to apply to all private communications in all privately negotiated contexts?</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.790" offset="13256454">The references by the draftsmen, by the House report, and others that were involved in the process, not later commentary in magazines, demonstrate irrefutably that the overall scope of the act, and its civil liability provisions in particular, didn't expand so drastically from the British Companies Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.624" offset="13339837">They said it was the same act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3303.497" offset="13359272">Mr. Frankfurter was involved in the drafting of the act but not as heavily as Mr. Landis, I think, if you believe what Mr. Landis wrote, which may be a stretch, I don't know, but it appears accurate that Mr. Frankfurter was overseeing it but was not as heavily drafted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.241" offset="13422279">In fact, I think Mr. Landis in his article referred to Mr. Frankfurter seeing the draft of the act for the first time before a meeting, or something along those lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.299" offset="13454567">He was not as heavily involved as Mr. Landis, who said public offerings not private offerings defines the exact scope of the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3350.900" offset="13548921">The whole design of the first ten sections of the act, and in particular section 5, the heart of the act, is directed solely at one context, public offerings.</text>

            <text syncTime="3379.778" offset="13664487">That's correct, they did not follow the phrase, include the phrase, to the public, which is in the British Companies Act, but Congress repeatedly said, the draftsmen said, this act is the British securities act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.601" offset="13719762">How could those statements be correctly made if one applies only to public distributions and the other is much, much broader, applying to every private transaction that ever involves the sale of a security and an interstate communication?</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.298" offset="13778485">The lack of any explanation, specific discussion or anything, anywhere in the legislative history or the House report of any notation that the act extended so much more broadly is to our mind very, very strong proof that Congress, none of the Congressmen, none of the drafters intended such a broad departure from the public offering context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.944" offset="13877124">They just simply couldn't have said the things they said in the reports about the act or in Mr. Landis' article about the act if that were the case, if the act intended to go into such a wide range of private, negotiated transactions.</text>
