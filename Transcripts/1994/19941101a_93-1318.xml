            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="68.727" offset="410505">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="72.512" offset="425656">Since 1920, the Interstate Commerce Act has prohibited common carriers from delivering freight on credit except pursuant to regulations adopted by the Interstate Commerce Commission governing credit transactions, and that prohibition was extended to motor carriers when they came under the ICC's jurisdiction in the Motor Carrier Act of 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.971" offset="575495">Prior thereto, it was focused on railroads, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.023" offset="595766">The ICC first adopted credit regulations in 1920 and from 1920 until 1988 those regulations contained no authorization of liquidated damages for late payment of freight charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.289" offset="688761">The only authorized remedy was to collect the prescribed rate for a timely payment plus interest for the delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.262" offset="732647">In rulemakings in the late 1980's, the ICC for the first time, at the behest of the American Trucking Association and other carrier interests, authorized liquidated damages for collection expense charges in the regulations, and those are set forth beginning at page 83a of the appendix to our petition, subpart g of the regulations, entitled "Collection Expense Charges".</text>
            <text syncTime="194.391" offset="913206">In an amicus brief filed in our support by the Health &amp; Personal Care Distribution Conference and some other shipping associations, on page 4 and 5, the course of the rulemaking proceedings is recounted and the citations are given.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.320" offset="1004948">The shipping interests were, of course, participants and quite concerned about unfairness to them that may eventuate and, because of that, the ICC included initially in the 1988 regulations and added in the revised regulations in 1989 certain conditions for the collection of these liquidated damages which, it is undisputed, were not complied with in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.430" offset="1157398">Those include from, beginning with the provision that was in the original 1988 regulations and was retained, a requirement that the original bills advise shippers of the consequence of late payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.830" offset="1262933">That is set forth on page 86a.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.917" offset="1287279">It's subpart (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="293.221" offset="1308490">And the two provisions that were added in 1989 to further protect shippers from the unfair practices are set forth first on page 85a, and that is subpart (g)(2)(vi), that revised bills have to be issued within a 90-day period after the original credit period had expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.478" offset="1449552">That also admittedly was not complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.280" offset="1460732">And then on page 84, subpart (iii) of (g)(2), it says that the loss of discount, or the liquidated damages, cannot be applied on an aggregated basis but can only be applied on separate and independent freight bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.115" offset="1576089">There are obviously great economies of scale in aggregate collections, and there was concern that aggregate collections would be made, particularly after carriers became insolvent, and there's a specific reference in that provision to a bankruptcy trustee attempting to collect on an aggregate basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.580" offset="1677966">So what we are concerned with here is an effort that was made by respondent, as the trustee for this insolvent carrier, to bill shippers from several years earlier and collect additional payments, including these very heavy liquidated damage charges, an effort that was specifically foreseen by the Commission in adopting the regulations authorizing credit transactions, and--</text>

            <text syncTime="421.837" offset="1822998">Mr. Wallace, could you clarify for me what this... what you've been calling the liquidated damages which the respondents call the bureau rate, when, other than in the context of liquidated damages for failure to pay on time, would this bureau rate apply, and in connection with that, what rate would apply to someone who is shipping these same goods on these same routes who pays on delivery, who doesn't get credit terms?</text>
            <text syncTime="453.125" offset="1948177">That wouldn't be the bureau rate, would it?</text>

            <text syncTime="472.086" offset="2024037">Wouldn't there be something even more favorable than the discounted rate?</text>

            <text syncTime="481.310" offset="2060921">--That could be, and as far as I'm aware was, the same discount rate, although there might be some further discount for cash payment which is not reflected in anything I've read in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="506.926" offset="2163321">There's no indication that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.212" offset="2172517">It is not... it is a source from which the real rates, the real filed rates are... the discount rates, it's a source from which the discount rates are calculated.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.452" offset="2225493">So that it's a source... it's a rate bureau source that determines the proportionality of what are the real rates, which are the discount rates, and the only way that this record reflects that those rates come into play at all is not as what I think are accurately regarded as rates for transportation, but as the measure of the liquidated damages for collection costs that is authorized under these regulations under the collection expense charges in little point (ii) at the top of page 84a of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.666" offset="2414306">That is one method of calculating liquidated damages that is authorized under this rule, if the rule is complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.058" offset="2459864">Now, the rule was designed specifically to forestall precisely the problem that arose here by conditioning the availability of these liquidated damage charges on compliance with certain safeguards for the shippers.</text>

            <text syncTime="609.577" offset="2573966">Well, ordinarily it's... it's the other way around that it occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.349" offset="2613046">The shippers have made their payments and would not be bringing an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.503" offset="2637705">It's the trustee who is trying to get additional payments from the shippers through the bankruptcy proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.193" offset="2668425">He has made claims against them, and the... this Court's holding in Southern Pacific Transportation Company v. Commercial Metals suggests that the shippers cannot themselves raise a defense, and we have briefed the case on that assumption.</text>

            <text syncTime="659.343" offset="2773019">Well, I was going to ask you, do you have a position as to whether or not the defense is available in the action itself?</text>

            <text syncTime="665.580" offset="2797993">We have briefed the case on the assumption that it would not be available to the shippers under the rationale of the Commercial Metals case, but I think in candor an argument could be made that Commercial Metals should not extend that far because what was directly involved in Commercial Metals was an effort not to pay the transportation rate itself, which--</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="694.766" offset="2914708">Well, if it's an invalid rate, then under our K Mart line of... under the K Mart case, it would seem to me that it's just a nonenforceable rate in the court, and it would seem to me that that would almost have to be the premise if you're to prevail here.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.228" offset="2992553">I'm not quite sure why there should be a difference.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="717.363" stopTime="1384.065">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="717.363" offset="3005091">--Well, we do take some solace from the K Mart case.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.334" offset="3024944">I don't want to overdraw the analogy, because the Court determined there that there was no valid, filed rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.272" offset="3056709">There was a rate that could be ascertained from tariff filings and the Court said that that could not prevail over a violation of the Commission's regulations, and in that way the case is very analogous to our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.449" offset="3117418">But Commercial Metals held, in the context of an effort by the shipper not to pay the transportation charge at all, the transportation rate, that the shipper could not raise that as a defense, that if there's to be a challenge to it because of violation of the Commission's credit regulations, and that is the only case of this Court that deals with a claim of violation of the credit regulations, that is to be enforced in the courts by the ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.372" offset="3257121">The reason I think that an argument could be made by shippers that Commercial Metals doesn't extend as far as this case is because in this case what is sought to be collected is not the rate for transportation or services that the statute requires to be in a tariff as a rate filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.655" offset="3358267">That rate is what would be payable in the transaction if the payment were made promptly, plus whatever interest there would be for delay in payment, precisely what the ICC's requested injunction would limit the trustee to collecting here.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.936" offset="3447397">What is sought to be collected in addition are these liquidated damages called collection expense charges authorized by the regulation beginning on page 83a, which are in the tariff, but not because the statute requiring the rates for transportation or services require it to be in the tariff... those statutes we've set forth in our brief on page 74a and 75a of the appendix to the petition... but instead it's because the regulation itself requires that those liquidated damage rates be in the tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.405" offset="3657317">They're entirely a creature of the regulation, and that is on 84a of the petition appendix under 2(i),</text>
            <text syncTime="894.712" offset="3714473">"Shall be described in the tariff rule. "</text>
            <text syncTime="897.680" offset="3726384">and (ii) says,</text>
            <text syncTime="899.782" offset="3734744">"Shall be applied without unlawful prejudice and/or unjust discrimination. "</text>
            <text syncTime="905.103" offset="3756059">Those requirements are creatures of the regulation, just as the authorization to collect these charges at all are creatures of the regulation, and the Commission, as I started to say at the outset, is acting in an area where Congress expressly relied on the Commission's regulations to set the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.968" offset="3855534">Congress proscribed altogether any credit transactions here except pursuant to regulations which the Commission may adopt, so the Commission was acting really at the zenith of its regulatory powers in fulfilling a mandate that Congress expressly relied on the Commission and only the Commission to fulfill here.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.536" offset="3957829">So regardless of whether the shippers could raise a defense, what Commercial Metals looked to was an even more venerable provision of the act that dates back to the original Interstate Commerce Act in 1887, the statutory authority for the Commission to bring an enforcement action in Federal court, and the Court in Commercial Metals emphasized that that could be an injunctive action to enforce the credit regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.161" offset="4112265">It should be remembered that at the time of the Commercial Metals decision in 1982, the credit regulations did not yet authorize this liquidated damages for the cost of collection, and the only defense being made by the shipper was a defense not to have to pay the filed rate for transportation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.096" offset="4235981">So there might have been anticipation that the Commission would be unlikely to bring an injunctive action which would say that the carrier should not be paid at all for the transportation, even in the circumstance where the carrier did not fully comply with the credit regulations, but at least as the Court interpreted the act, that was to be left to the Commission's enforcement authority rather than an equitable defense by the shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.388" offset="4389163">Well, since the conditions admittedly were not complied with for assessing the liquidated damages, it might seem obvious, in light of Commercial Metals and the Commission's enforcement authority in 49 U.S.C. 11702 that I've referred to, that the Commission's action to enjoin this belated effort of the trustee acting in perfect good faith to try to enhance the value of the estate, to enjoin this effort to collect liquidated damages when these very carefully constructed conditions had not been complied with to the obvious prejudice of the shippers whom the conditions were designed to protect, and that the trustee, standing in the shoes of Transcon, should be relegated to the historic remedy that existed from 1920 to 1988 of the transportation charge plus interest for any lateness in the payment, obviously a remedy that could not be said to be incompatible with the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.981" offset="4751534">The court of appeals, however, said no, that that rather obvious conclusion should not be reached because of the filed rate doctrine as it understood that doctrine to have been applied by this Court in Maislin Industries v. Primary Steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.930" offset="4847351">Now, we think that this was misconceived by the court of appeals from the outset, and the first thing to be said is that Maislin, in contrast to this case, involved an effort to enforce an unfiled rate, the negotiated rate which was never filed, but under the Commission's then negotiated rates policy was to be enforced in preference to the actual filed rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.735" offset="4974619">And Maislin itself, in footnote 11 of the Maislin opinion, pointed out that the case was therefore different from prior decisions of the Court in which the question was which of two filed rates should be applied, rather than an effort to depart from the filed rate schedule altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.337" offset="5096977">And we think that that footnote applies a fortiori in this case, because here it's not a choice between two filed rates for transportation, it's a choice between the filed rate for transportation, which the Commission says the trustee is entitled to, and this other charge of liquidated damages that is not a filed rate for transportation within the meaning of the statutes that require rates for transportation and services to be provided, but as I previously explained is entirely a creature of the regulations which is required to be in the tariff only because the regulations require it to be in the tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.354" offset="5293104">That is the source of the obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.072" offset="5315883">Then this Court decided Reiter v. Cooper after the court of appeals' initial decision, which we thought made the error more manifest because Reiter established quite clearly the principle that Maislin did not mean that the filed rate doctrine would preclude claims and defenses that are specifically accorded by the act itself, such as the Commission's express statutory authority to bring an action for an injunction to enforce its credit regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.904" offset="5507308">So when we petitioned for certiorari for the first time in this case, we suggested that the judgment be vacated and the case remanded for reconsideration in light of Reiter v. Cooper, which is the course that the Court took, but on remand the court of appeals reached the same conclusion, basically holding that the ICC statutory enforcement authority should be subordinated to its view of the filed rate doctrine, which is--</text>

            <text syncTime="2109.517" offset="8573666">The ICC, in its 1988 decision authorizing the filing of loss of discount tariff provisions, said that under the filed rate doctrine the carrier must enforce the loss of discount tariff provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.908" offset="8627269">In the trial court, before Judge Hill heard the issue that he disposed of by summary judgment, he specifically asked the ICC's counsel whether it agreed that the loss of discount tariff provision, which is a part of the rules tariff, whether the ICC agreed that the rules tariffs were a part of the carrier's filed rate within the meaning of Maislin, and the ICC's counsel responded, yes, I don't take issue with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.242" offset="8736566">The ICC also put in a declaration from a tariff expert, a Mr. Manning, on November 8, 1991, in support of its cross motion for summary judgment, and he said in his declaration that Transcon's TCON 625, which is the discount tariff, is governed by Transcon's TCON 103, which is the rules tariff, in which the loss of discount tariff provision appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.893" offset="8843250">So there is no dispute, and there was no dispute in the trial court, and the evidence was only on one side on this issue, that this loss of discount tariff provision governs the rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3134.923" offset="12675308">The rule of this Court has always been, it is discriminatory when a carrier departs from its filed rate unless and until the ICC sets it aside, and in your hypothetical, Justice Breyer, the Commission could prosecute people for wilfully disobeying the credit regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.218" offset="12744481">It could also sue a carrier prospectively saying, you've got to send out these reminder notices, you have to let people know, and it could get contempt penalties for violation of that injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3301.450" offset="13341431">--that isn't the only thing that I'm saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.152" offset="13352298">It's... the suggestion that the Commission could strike this provision is really a rather impractical one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.539" offset="13385839">There's nothing on its face that's incompatible with the statute or the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.562" offset="13409872">This, the liquidated damages provision as it appears in the tariff could have been lawfully enforced if the conditions that were not complied with had been complied with, so there was no basis for striking it from the tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.571" offset="13477895">If the tariff had also said, and these liquidated damages can be assessed on an aggregated basis, not merely on an individual basis, that would have been a provision that the Commission could have struck from the tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.533" offset="13541738">But what good would it have done the Commission to strike that from the tariff when under the respondent's submission the same result could be reached anyway, because the liquidated damages provision itself remains in the tariff, and that has to be enforceable regardless of violations of the safeguards that were placed in the Commission's regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.016" offset="13647690">And I want to say, in response to a question raised by Justice Ginsburg, on page 33a of the petition for certiorari appendix the court of appeals discusses the meager case authority, in the first paragraph on that page, that existed about efforts to try to include liquidated damages provisions before they were authorized by regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.918" offset="13755315">The Commission took the position in this litigation that those cases striking down those efforts to have them solely as a creature of tariff were correctly decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.975" offset="13799514">They were... only one of the district court decisions was reported, but that was all there was on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.229" offset="13832533">The great controversy that took place over a period of 3 years in the late eighties would have been rather meaningless if carriers had been free to prescribe this for themselves in their tariff filings without authorization from the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.257" offset="13904631">That's what the controversy in the rulemaking was about.</text>
