            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="10.498" offset="179064">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.281" offset="198186">The respondent was a California lawyer who became involved in drug dealing and other crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.006" offset="229115">With money obtained from his crimes, he invested in a venture to mine gold in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.740" offset="256073">He was eventually convicted of narcotics offenses and of violating the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.595" offset="291495">RICO makes it a crime for any person to use income derived from a pattern of racketeering activity to acquire an interest in any enterprise</text>
            <text syncTime="48.152" offset="329739">"which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect interstate or foreign commerce. "</text>
            <text syncTime="53.606" offset="351577">The Ninth Circuit affirmed the narcotics conviction, but it reversed the RICO conviction for lack of proof that the activities of the gold mining venture affected interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.102" offset="397553">The court held that a minimal effect on interstate commerce would be sufficient to satisfy RICO, but that an incidental effect on that commerce would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.320" offset="438408">The court then found that the Government's evidence, including the fact that the gold mining venture had hired employees outside of Alaska and purchased equipment outside of Alaska, showed, at most, an incidental effect on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.701" offset="499953">The Ninth Circuit emphasized that Alaska's geographical isolation means that most supplies and equipment must get there via interstate commerce, and it believed that Alaska's dependence on interstate commerce should not mean that local businesses in Alaska are covered by RICO.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.073" offset="573409">We brought the case here because the Ninth Circuit decision conflicts with the view of every other court of appeals that has considered what sort of a jurisdictional proof satisfies the requirements of RICO.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="123.863" stopTime="126.795">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="123.863" offset="632550">I think it's we rather than you who brought the case here.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="126.795" stopTime="260.682">
            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="126.795" offset="644253">Well, I stand corrected, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.085" offset="657419">Our argument in the case, now that it is here, Mr. Chief Justice, starts with the language of RICO, and that language reaches all enterprises the activities of which affect interstate or foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.025" offset="713216">This Court's cases made clear that the phrase, affect commerce, is a term of art that Congress uses to exercise all commerce power it has under the Constitution, and that Congress intended to exercise all of its constitutional power in RICO is confirmed not only by its use of that term of art, but also by the fact that one of its principal goals in enacting RICO, which was to safeguard small businesses from infiltration by organized crime, could likely not be achieved under any narrower view of the jurisdictional requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.968" offset="853024">Under RICO, then, in our view, the question is whether the activities of the enterprise, here the gold mining venture, affect commerce when measured by the full constitutional authority of Congress and, under that standard, the evidence in this case was sufficient to meet the Government's burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.750" offset="924077">The Ninth Circuit conceded that respondent and his employees traveled between Alaska and the Lower 48 States in connection with the work in the mine, that the mine obtained supplies and equipment from the Lower 48 States, and the respondent mortgaged a home he owned in Arizona to finance the second mining season in 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.486" offset="1019058">In addition, the evidence showed that the mine sold a substantial amount of gold in Alaska worth at least $200,000, that the purchasers of the gold were part of a broader market in precious metals that reached beyond Alaska, and that therefore the mine's output was part of a class of activities that in the aggregate substantially affects interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.118" offset="1105575">In addition, the evidence showed that respondent and his associates used the instrumentalities of interstate commerce repeatedly, the mail and the telephones, as part of the business of the mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.347" offset="1154477">In our view, all of that evidence was clearly sufficient to satisfy the Government's burden under--</text>

            <text syncTime="260.682" offset="1179868">Mr. Estrada, in your view, is there any business enterprise in America that wouldn't be covered by RICO?</text>

            <text syncTime="270.658" offset="1219783">--As a factual matter, Justice O'Connor, I cannot think of any business in the country that could not be covered by RICO, given that what is at issue is the full constitutional authority of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.485" offset="1271087">I understand that the Commerce principle is a limited one, and we do agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.913" offset="1304733">However, the facts on which it operates are not limited, and in our economy on this day, I cannot think of anything that is likely to actually happen in the real world that would not be covered by this Court's cases construing the extent of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="321.242" offset="1422075">Well, this case is significantly different from Lopez.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.047" offset="1457288">As I understand the claim of the respondent in Lopez and the view that was followed by the Fifth Circuit in that case, Congress is required to make findings and to set forth some sort of an explanation as to why it views the activities that it is trying to reach as affecting commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.515" offset="1571182">We do not think that that is the case, but even if it were in this case, I think Congress did that and more.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.741" offset="1600126">Congress in this case considered the statute very carefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.313" offset="1618411">It was dealing with a broad national problem that it thought the old laws, both State and Federal, had been entirely inadequate to deal with.</text>

            <text syncTime="681.096" offset="2861526">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but in fact, and the Court has explained on occasion, that even though the cases speak of Congress' power to reach anything that affects commerce, some of the more cases... some of the Court's cases have been more specific, and have pointed out that Congress under the Commerce Clause can reach only commerce in itself, but that under the Necessary and Proper Clause, Congress can then reach other things that are not in themselves commerce, but that affect commerce, and this Court's cases dealing with whether something affects commerce and saying that Congress has power to reach those matters are usually... are logically traceable to reasoning based ultimately on the Necessary and Proper Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.837" offset="3108436">I was going to turn to the justifications given by the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.903" offset="3144694">The court of appeals though that despite all of the evidence of interstate conduct in this case, the fact that the enterprise hired employees and purchased equipment outside of Alaska, that a different result was warranted by its description of the effects on commerce as incidental rather than minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.040" offset="3257229">And that was wrong, because this Court stated in Wickard v. Filburn that questions as to the constitutional power of Congress really should not be solved by reference to any formula that gives controlling weight to nomenclature, and that the real question is whether actual effects can be identified on commerce, and in this case, they surely could.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.667" offset="3355763">The second reason that the Ninth Circuit gave was based on the isolation of the State of Alaska, and we do not think that that isolation should count against our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.056" offset="3413337">It is certainly true that many of the businesses in Alaska have to obtain supplies and equipment from interstate commerce, but that State is hardly unique in that respect, and much the same could be said about Rhode Island or Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.988" offset="3489092">No State of the Union is entirely self-sufficient, and in our view it makes little sense to say that the greater a State's dependence on interstate commerce, the less likely it will be that the activities within that State will be deemed to affect interstate commerce.</text>
