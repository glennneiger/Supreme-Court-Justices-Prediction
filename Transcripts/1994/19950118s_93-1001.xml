            <text syncTime="11.678" offset="134231">This case involves a local termite inspection contract made in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.821" offset="154711">The contract had a clause, requiring arbitration of disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.648" offset="174042">The respondent bought the house they found it swarming with termites.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.157" offset="188148">So, they brought a law suit in State Court, and The Terminix asked for arbitration, but the Alabama Courts wouldn't send the case to arbitration because under Alabama law, arbitration clauses like this are invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.565" offset="241751">In section two of the Federal Arbitration Act, however, makes them valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.974" offset="259410">So, the question was, does the federal law govern or the state law govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.525" offset="277591">There were three parts to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.269" offset="288562">First part, the people who said the state law governs says that this court should overrule a case called Southland which held really that Federal Arbitration Act governs in state courts and these people said no, that shouldn't be so, the state law should govern in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.624" offset="357944">This court refuses to overrule Southland, and therefore, the Federal Arbitration Act is applicable in state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.398" offset="389082">The second question concerned the meaning of a word in that act, involving commerce, and if involving commerce has a broad interpretation, then this contract may fall within it.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.346" offset="436833">We felt that it does have a broad interpretation, and the third question was whether or not the other words called a contract evidencing, like it has to evidence commerce and does that have a broad or a narrow interpretation, and basically we held that these words evidencing commerce have a broad interpretation, and basically what was an issue and functionally is some people argued that the broad interpretations might hurt consumers because a person who was a consumer who had a very large damage claim would not be able to get into the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.380" offset="592941">They'd have to go to arbitration and we thought that probably the purpose of this statute thing to help people like consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.074" offset="623766">More often a broad interpretation would help them particularly if they had small claims where they want to go to arbitration rather than be in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.861" offset="662949">So, on balance we felt that the broader interpretation of the words involving commerce was more consistent with the basic purposes of the Federal Arbitration Act and we held that, therefore, it governs.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.356" offset="780918">Justice O'Conner thought not to dissent, but a concurring opinion and as well as joining the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.618" offset="801921">There is that separate opinion and also Justice Scalia filed a dissent and Justice Thomas joined by Justice Scalia filed a dissent.</text>
