            <text syncTime="73.631" offset="433475">The nontaxpayer may challenge the Government collection action in a wrongful levy, a quiet title, or a foreclosure proceeding, and may obtain a release of the Federal lien if they want to make an immediate sale by providing substitute collateral from the proceeds of the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.211" offset="503797">Historically, however, nontaxpayers have not been permitted simply to pay the tax and sue for a refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.016" offset="535039">The collateral litigation of tax obligations by nontaxpayers would present a quagmire of problems that the courts and Congress have not traditionally sanctioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.146" offset="579552">In this case, however, the Ninth Circuit held that a nontaxpayer whose property became subject to a lien that arose from someone else's obligations may simply pay the tax, even though she admittedly didn't owe it, and sue for a refund.</text>

            <text syncTime="759.960" offset="3178840">Every case that has actually addressed the question of whether a nontaxpayer may bring a refund suit has said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.474" offset="3208829">There are two lines of authority that follow along that same principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.007" offset="3227010">One line of authority is the Parsons v. Anglim type case, where the person who paid the tax did so under what the Court said was a reasonable assumption, or a reasonable belief that the Government was taking the position she was the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.436" offset="3288763">Obviously, a person can come in the court and say, well, I paid the tax because you claimed it was due from me, but I don't think I owe it.</text>

            <text syncTime="797.574" offset="3329305">That's one line of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.484" offset="3336933">The other line of authority are the kinds of cases like Stewart v. Chinese Chamber of Commerce, which is cited in the Phillips decision in the Second Circuit, and in that case the court says a nontaxpayer cannot bring a refund suit, but what they can do... and this may relate to the point that you just raised, Justice Ginsburg... what they can do is that before 1966 they could sue the collector, the district director, to recover property that the district director had taken to pay someone else's taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.794" offset="3458141">Now, in the First National Bank of Amlinton case, which we cite in our brief simply as the First National Bank case, it's the Third Circuit case, the Court explains the limit on that branch, if you will, of authority to recover property, and that is that once the Government has sold the property and the money has been deposited in the Government's Treasury, that avenue of jurisdiction doesn't exist, because then it would be a suit against the United States for a refund.</text>

            <text syncTime="2927.689" offset="11849717">Well, it seems to me we do have to go that far, under your interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.831" offset="11862256">Let me ask you one question before you get back to the Internal Revenue Code section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.042" offset="11879183">What about a mechanic's lien?</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.415" offset="11892662">Suppose that a person closes an escrow knowing that there's a mechanic's lien on the house, so that the mechanic's lien passes to the subsequent purchaser, can the purchaser challenge the mechanic's lien on the ground that the work was never performed?</text>

            <text syncTime="2955.068" offset="11959222">--I would assume so, under the facts of that hypothetical, that if the work was never performed, it would be a defense to a mechanic's lien, although I'm not an expert in mechanic's lien law, so I might be misspeaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.304" offset="12004153">Your honor, I would like, once again, to just take a moment to go into what the Government's concerns are, and to perhaps alleviate some of their fears.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.971" offset="12050860">In the situation that the Government cites in their brief, the possibility for tax evasion, you would have to have, in essence, two parties, on one hand a taxpayer, the person that owes the tax under their definition, and a friend... let's call him a coconspirator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.844" offset="12130376">That coconspirator says to his taxpayer friend, I'm going to pay your taxes, we're going to wait for the statute of limitations to expire, I'm going to help you evade taxes, and then I'm going to file a refund suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.794" offset="12190145">That situation is somewhat preposterous in real life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.428" offset="12208639">You're talking about a situation where a person's going to come out of pocket, using the numbers in this case, $40,000, on the hopes that they might get their money back if they file a refund claim, just to help their friend evade taxes because the statute of limitations is expiring.</text>

            <text syncTime="3033.037" offset="12271124">That's fanciful, but they're worried, I think, about another thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.400" offset="12284603">What statute of limitations would govern?</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.921" offset="12294634">You'd have to either call your client a taxpayer, which would then give the words "taxpayer" different meanings in different sections of the code, which is worrying them, or alternatively you'd have to say, she's not a taxpayer, and then it would seem that no statute of limitations would govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.896" offset="12374569">We'd have to create one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.185" offset="12379689">So that's one of the problems they've raised.</text>

            <text syncTime="3064.539" offset="12397139">My response is on line with the courts that have ruled on this, and I cited a few in my brief, which were not authority to this Court, but I cited them just so that you could see how other judges have gone through the same analysis, which is that the word 6511 is used in its generic sense, that it's used as the person who pays the taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.971" offset="12482821">It's not used as a term of art in that sense.</text>
