            <text syncTime="16.039" offset="150912">After respondent was charged with possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute, he and his attorney asked to meet with the prosecutor to discuss the possibility of cooperating with the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.401" offset="204411">The prosecutor agreed to meet the respondent but on the condition that respondent?s statements could be used to impeach in the contradictory testimony he might give a trial if the case proceeded that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.877" offset="258328">Respondent conferred with his attorney and agreed to the prosecutor?s terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.555" offset="277031">The pre-discussions were ultimately unsuccessful and respondent testified a trial on his own behalf when respondent contradicted statements he made to the prosecutor the government introduced his plea statements to impeach him.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.311" offset="340039">Respondent objected on the ground that statements made during plea negotiations are inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 410 and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(e)(6).</text>

            <text syncTime="89.889" offset="446409">The plea statement rule says nothing about waiver, but this does not foreclose voluntary wavier agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.748" offset="473786">The rules must be read against the background presumption that legal rights generally and evidentiary provisions specifically are subject to waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.983" offset="510775">Respondent there has a burden of identifying some affirmative basis for concluding that the plea statement rules depart from the presumption of waivability.</text>
