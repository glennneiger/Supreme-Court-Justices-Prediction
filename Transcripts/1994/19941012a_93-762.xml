            <text syncTime="27.583" offset="254763">In furtherance of the divided argument, I intend on concentrating on nonpreemption argument issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="39.725" offset="303350">On April 13, 1992, the Chicago Loop flooded.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.081" offset="344833">Thousands of persons and businesses suffered losses estimated upwards of $1 billion.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.837" offset="371791">This catastrophe, which has now come to be known as the Chicago Flood, resulted from two occurrences.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.824" offset="403765">One was the City of Chicago's failure to maintain or repair an extensive underground tunnel system under the City of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.113" offset="440964">The second was the pile-driving activities which occurred on the North Branch of the Chicago River to protect the Kinzie Street Bridge, which had been completed more than 6 months earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.170" offset="489133">The pile-driving work was performed by Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Company, the respondent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.510" offset="518495">It accomplished this work using a tractor crane positioned on top of a spud scow which had been posted into the river bed and which was being used as a stationary platform.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.186" offset="577218">On these facts, the Seventh Circuit, in reversing the district court, found that admiralty jurisdiction existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.292" offset="613685">In order to accomplish this, it had to do two things:</text>
            <text syncTime="121.593" offset="630822">1) acting alone from the other circuits which have considered similar situations, it refused to adopt or use the totality-of-the-circumstances approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.401" offset="678051">Secondly, it misapplied the rulings of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.639" offset="699053">It did that by misconstruing every ingredient that this Court indicated in Sisson and the cases before it, Executive Jet, and Foremost required.</text>

            <text syncTime="160.920" offset="788183">In footnote numbers 3 and 4, the Court recognizes that the circuits were employing the totality-of-the-circumstances test and suggested that at least for that case that the guidance formula of Sisson would be adequate guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.363" offset="857878">It never said that no other circuit could continue to use that.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.965" offset="868327">However, even if it did for the facts of that particular case, where all of the activities were uniform, were the same, it left open the door as to what the case would be where the instrumentalities were involved in different activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.193" offset="933215">I would offer to the Court that in this particular case, we have myriad activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.311" offset="949724">The City of Chicago alone is engaged in at least two nonmaritime activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.032" offset="968637">One is the construction or maintenance of a bridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.484" offset="982430">The second is, is the maintenance of their underground tunnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.703" offset="995282">We then have the nonmaritime activities of all of the other instrumentalities, all of the people like Grubart and the businesses and buildings in the Chicago Loop, which are far away, none of whom were engaged in any activity which, under any argument, could be maritime.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.359" offset="1133940">Unfortunately, and one of the other errors that the Seventh Circuit committed, was that it allowed the Admiralty Extension Act to bootstrap this Court's requirement, and skipped it.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.148" offset="1177094">If you are to separate the Admiralty Extension Act from a nexus requirement, which this Court cannot intend, what it would be doing is, defeat its own opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.436" offset="1214188">It would take all land-based injuries and put them in a special category, and allow them to have admiralty jurisdiction without any connection to traditional maritime activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="475.015" offset="2044568">If you don't do that, you wind up with a case like this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.401" offset="2062123">You wind up with a case where the Seventh Circuit has felt it could not ask any of the questions which go to the substantiality issue, and I would repeat that this Court has used significant, the wrong must bear a significant relationship to traditional maritime activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="498.231" offset="2137355">Because the Court was tired of what it called absurd results.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.750" offset="2155432">This case in admiralty, I propose, would be an absurd result.</text>

            <text syncTime="526.632" offset="2251040">But this case is not of a type designed for admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.852" offset="2267863">You have common tort remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.554" offset="2278730">If you take the naked Sisson test and disregard a substantiality, you're realistically going to get the same kind of absurd result that this Court has encountered, and which it did not want to encounter.</text>

            <text syncTime="3232.032" offset="13072630">That is why I say, Justice Scalia, admiralty jurisdiction is inherently preempted, and the test we urge is the preemption test this Court already uses when it asks whether State courts have lost jurisdiction.</text>
