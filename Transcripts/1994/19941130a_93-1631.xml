            <text syncTime="174.679" offset="847390">Well, thus far, although I think the materials suggest that we're beginning to see some movement into traditional advertising, that has not been a problem, and perhaps because advertising is often at a national level, particularly media advertising, so that advertising, if it's not lawful everywhere, for instance, in network TV, that it wouldn't be placed because it wouldn't be lawful in a number of States into which it would go.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.664" offset="955328">And of course, if the States perceive a problem in this area, they may enact laws addressing that.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="207.901" offset="980301">But it certainly weakens the Government's position with regard to the justification for the labeling ban.</text>

            <text syncTime="214.054" offset="1004960">No, I think it... first of all, the point you're raising I think would only go to the application, in any event, to the labeling ban in those States that allow advertising but don't require the labeling, and thus far in this case respondent has not challenged the application of the labeling requirement on a State-by-State basis in that manner, and again, the substantial governmental interest here includes the interest in accommodating State regulations, so the labeling restriction applies unless a State strikes a different balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.894" offset="1148320">Now, if in those States that have not prohibited advertising the Federal regulation on labeling were thought to be somewhat undermined, that would be a problem only in those States.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.051" offset="1200879">But again, that has not been the burden of respondent's argument in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.503" offset="1214776">Respondent's submission of its labels to ATF was across the board and, in fact, at page 61 of the Joint Appendix respondent asks, specifically asks ATF to consider its submission as a package, as a program, including, in fact, both advertising and labeling restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.082" offset="1297009">ATF denied it except in those States that allowed it in the manner that you've described, and then respondent brought this suit under the APA to challenge ATF's restriction across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.074" offset="1349045">If it... if... an as-applied, or a State-by-State challenge of the sort you're describing, would be a different lawsuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="320.471" offset="1430652">In fact, it's interesting, at page 35 of the appendix to the petition, where the district court's decision on remand is set forth, the district court specifically acknowledges in the first paragraph on page 35a, I agree after hearing the evidence that attempts to market alcohol content as a product attribute are not legitimate attempts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2462.040" offset="9996830">Even assuming that this law did marginally advance the Government's strength war interest, it is certainly not reasonably tailored, under the fourth prong of the Central Hudson test.</text>

            <text syncTime="2475.865" offset="10052209">The Government could directly and more effectively achieve both its strength war interests and its Twenty-First Amendment interest simply by limiting the alcohol content of beer except in States that permit a higher limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.209" offset="10109574">The Government has actually conceded in this case that its strength war objective could be fully satisfied by a Federal alcohol content limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.815" offset="10148027">It lamely argues, however, that such a Federal limit would be inconsistent with its Twenty-First Amendment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.884" offset="10176239">That is plainly not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.170" offset="10185434">Simply by providing the same kind of State override for a Federal alcohol limit that the law already provides for the labeling ban, the Government could directly and more effectively achieve both of its asserted interests, so even if the law marginally advanced the Government's interest, it surely fails the reasonably tailored prong.</text>

            <text syncTime="3065.944" offset="12412529">Now, Mr. Kneedler said that it's only some years ago that malt liquor came to be known as the highest strength malt beverage, but if you'll look at the 1935 hearings before the FACA regulations, you will see over and over again there that at that time ale was thought to be, and known to be, the highest strength beer product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.358" offset="12490165">And there was questioning and testimony about that, and the chairman and every witness said, it is okay with us to allow you to use the word ale, as long as it's truthfully ale, even though that means that consumers will know which are the highest strength products.</text>

            <text syncTime="3405.359" offset="13770165">So the point is, Coors was holding itself out as having at least an average, if not above-average alcohol content within each segment of the market, which is precisely what this is--</text>
