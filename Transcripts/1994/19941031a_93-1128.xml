            <text syncTime="592.771" offset="2519283">--The argument we're making, Justice Scalia, is this: the statute was intended to cover... let me back up, if I may for a minute, to 1924, and what was the situation in 1924.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.331" offset="2565468">Since 1917, the VA had provided hospitalization and medical care benefits for veterans with service-connected disabilities, and that left a gap, a perceived gap in the coverage of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.291" offset="2625341">The VA felt that its authority to compensate for the foreseeable result of the injury would cover the normal results of medical care, but it did not feel that it would cover something where an intervening cause had come along in the form of malpractice by a VA physician or some particularly unforeseeable thing that happened while the veteran was under VA care, and it was for that reason that it proposed the statute in 1924.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.320" offset="2737458">That's... if you look at the legislative materials, what they are talking about is, Congress, we have to fix this statute because there are a limited number of cases where we have a veteran who comes in and there's no current statutory authority to compensate for cases of malpractice or error in judgment and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.861" offset="2799630">Now, they therefore passed section 213, which is now section 1151.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.543" offset="2826274">Now, we know that that was not intended to address the question of nonservice-connected veterans because there was no treatment for nonservice-connected veterans, with limited exceptions, before that, and we know that it could not have been intended exclusively to address the cases of examinations, where somebody might be examined, be injured, and then be found not to have a service-connected condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.580" offset="2922510">That was a set of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.291" offset="2925331">But Congress didn't focus exclusively on that, because in fact they had to amend the statute in 1925 to cover those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.806" offset="2951349">So what we're left with, as a matter of detection, is saying, what was Congress getting at?</text>
            <text syncTime="705.060" offset="2968381">What they were getting at is these cases of service-connected veterans who were injured under care of the VA in some way that was not considered to be a proximate cause of their service-connected injury, and that was either for one... it was for one of two reasons, either because there was intervening negligence on the part of some VA agent, or because something simply freakish happened, something that was completely unforeseeable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1224.520" offset="5046265">The fact is, the VA has drawn a somewhat different line, a somewhat more conservative line, which is to say, at the 5 or 10 percent level, if this is something that if you open the textbook of medicine and said, you're going to have this operation and here are the possible side effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.411" offset="5109794">Or to look at it in another way, if this is something you would be considered to have consented to as a matter of informed consent when you underwent the treatment in the first place, then that is not the kind of thing that Congress meant to cover as a disability matter under the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1359.507" offset="5586163">I would like first to address a number of points that were made by Mr. DuMont in his argument before I proceed to my presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.965" offset="5620018">First, there was a suggestion that because the VA adjudicates compensation claims in a proper fashion and there's no evidence that they do so in an improper fashion, this scheme of fault or accident is permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.947" offset="5691907">In Mr. Gardner's own case, the VA did not adjudicate his compensation claim according to their own standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.374" offset="5725657">He applied to the regional office in Waco, Texas, with the assistance of VA personnel who actually gave him the form to fill out initially, and the hearing officer, who was a lay person, not trained in the law or medicine, but someone whose job it is to attempt to apply the statutes of Congress to compensation claims, denied Mr. Gardner's claim based upon an outdated regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.630" offset="5834640">The regulation that was utilized by the hearing officer was one that was amended by the Veterans Administration in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.496" offset="5866092">It had existed from 1936 to 1978.</text>

            <text syncTime="2941.378" offset="11913648">--Well, here's my answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.149" offset="11916782">What Your Honor is inviting is, Your Honor is inviting a regulation like the current regulation, which was not in place, by the way, at the time of Mr. Gardner's surgery, and the current regulation says that the foreseeable consequences of medical care and treatment, properly administered, would not entitle the veteran to compensation without a showing of fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.314" offset="12005390">Now, to my mind, we're talking about foreseeability in a medical context, and that determination is an unreasonable one, makes no sense to me, and cannot possibly inform the decision of the Veterans' Administration how to handle a case on an individual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.954" offset="12071950">The Office of General Counsel opinion which led to that regulation dealt with exposure to HIV virus by virtue of receiving a blood transfusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.533" offset="12114268">The conclusion of the Office of General Counsel was that if the veteran received a blood transfusion before it was known that you could contract HIV, that was considered unforeseeable and an accident, and you get compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.930" offset="12159825">On the other hand, the veterans who were exposed to HIV, contracted it, and died during the time period when the VA knew that that was a possibility, aren't entitled to compensation under 1151, and unless the literal language of the statute isn't followed by the VA on a case-by-case basis, regulations such as this, and their changing nature over the 70 years that we've seen them, are going to essentially deny veterans the benefits that Congress said they should have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.950" offset="12279989">Different veterans with the same condition at different points in time in the history of the administration of this statute would be granted benefits or denied benefits, depending upon the particular interpretation that the VA had of the statute at that particular point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.461" offset="12349997">Congress has not authorized the Veterans Administration to make such policy choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.854" offset="12371522">Rather, Congress has said that they must make rules and regulations consistent with the laws, and the Court of Veterans' Appeals has a mandate to strike down those regulations which are inconsistent with the laws, and this regulation is inconsistent with the laws, and the hard cases are taken care of by the factual deference that the Court owes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="3106.207" offset="12572978">To return just briefly, Justice Ginsburg, to your question about... and perhaps this is also your question, Justice Stevens, about numbers, what I can tell you is, on page 35 of our brief at note 20 we point out that in 1933, when the statute, after all, had just been repealed, there were 66,000 admissions to VA hospitals for nonservice-connected conditions, whereas in 1934, when Senator Steiwer was arguing for reenactment of this provision, what he said was, there might be 65 or 67 people who were affected by reenacting section 213.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.820" offset="12715398">That has two significances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.181" offset="12720831">One is, there were quite a few people out there who presumably had some bad consequence of care who were not getting benefits, and one might have thought that they would bring this to the attention of Congress if that was wrong, and the second is that there were simply not very many people who were being granted benefits under this statute when Congress reenacted it in 1934, and that gives us some idea of what scope they had in mind when they reenacted it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3218.932" offset="13023852">Congress has made the choice explicitly in a statute to say that anyone... in the line of duty has been interpreted very broadly to mean anything that happens to you while you are physically in the service.</text>

            <text syncTime="3418.824" offset="13823408">They said they were a common, foreseeable result of the surgery, and there was no indication of any kind of fault on the part of VA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.047" offset="13852351">They're really two sides of the same coin, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.521" offset="13862278">So one could either read their opinion to have made a definitive finding on that issue and we win hands-down, or one could read it to leave open some room for foreseeability analysis that hasn't taken place and remand it back, but I'm quite confident what the result would be based on their opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.880" offset="13923718">Just, in quick closing, we think that the discussion with Mr. Hannon has clearly demonstrated our fundamental point here, which is that the language of the statute does not, on its face, resolve this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.048" offset="13972305">The as-a-result-of language, the injury language, leave plenty of room for interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.911" offset="13987770">And when we get down to questions like, is it 100 percent, or 75 percent, or 50 percent, or 5 percent where one draws a foreseeability line, that is classically the kind of decision that ought to be left in the hands of the administrative agency that has been committed by Congress with the task of interpreting the statute and administering it, and I think that the VA has done a perfectly reasonable job here, the courts below failed to defer, and this Court should correct that error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.947" offset="14075959">Thank you.</text>
