            <text syncTime="12.908" offset="200693">This case involves the common and troublesome question of who is a seaman under the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.812" offset="228278">Unfortunately, the Jones Act does not define the statutory term, seaman, so that task is left to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.769" offset="268089">This Court has struggled with that issue over the years, as have the circuit and district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.589" offset="295361">Traditionally, the test that has been used, even if it has more than two parts, breaks the seaman test down into the examination of the connection of the employee to his employer, or the vessel and then, secondly, the employee's contribution to the vessel itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.753" offset="384073">In Wilander, this Court addressed the second part of that test, and answered the question of whether a seaman must contribute to the navigation of the vessel and, of course, the holding was that that is not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.362" offset="438512">The seaman must merely contribute to the function or contribute to the mission of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.266" offset="466097">The issue today addresses the first question, and that is, what is the employment-related connection to the vessel that is necessary?</text>
            <text syncTime="92.026" offset="517088">Wilander, although it addressed the navigation issue, did make statements and give clues as to what employment-related connection is necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1848.150" offset="7541624">One of them, of course, is what we've been focusing on so far, which test to be applied, but there's another one as well, and that has not been addressed in the petition, nor has it been addressed in the brief on the merits, and that is to say, the Second Circuit's holding that the trial judge was in error in instructing this jury as a matter of law that the vessel was out of navigation when it was in drydock in Germany, and that is an independent basis for the Court's decision, and it has not been addressed in the petition nor in the brief on the merits.</text>
