            <text syncTime="7.518" offset="117617">This is a case that arrives under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.643" offset="138097">When a worker is covered by the Act sustains an injury, the Act has a comprehensive scheme to compensating for loss in wage-earning capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.767" offset="182609">There are two kinds of injuries, one is an injury which is on a schedule usually for the loss of a limb and the other is so-called non-scheduled injuries, which is what's involved here, the employee injured is back.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.751" offset="234541">He received an award because of the injury heâ€™d lost wage-earning capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.148" offset="260141">He then attended a school for training as acrane operator and for operating heavy equipment, and he became a crane operator and his earnings capacity is a result increased, he increased quite substantially.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.648" offset="322208">The employer sought a modification of the award and cited the statute but says an award can be modified if there is achange in conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.811" offset="362854">The employee, the worker said changing conditions means only physical condition and my back is still injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.216" offset="388454">The employer said, no, it means also a change in your wage-earning capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.336" offset="408934">We took the case up because the circuits are in disagreement on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.979" offset="431504">We agree with the employer that a change inconditions under the statute, he includes a change in wage-earning capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.444" offset="477375">Disability is an economic concept not a medical concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.445" offset="497332">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit where this case rose and remanded the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.844" offset="530978">Justice Stevens has filed a dissent.</text>
