            <text syncTime="13.641" offset="194762">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.821" offset="203434">The question in this case is whether the issue of materiality in a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 1001 is an issue of law for the court or an issue of fact for the jury to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.630" offset="254634">The Ninth Circuit held in its en banc decision in this case that materiality presents a factual matter that must be decided by the jury under this Court's due process and Sixth Amendment decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.419" offset="305834">In so holding, it disagreed with the holding of every other regional court of appeals that had considered the question, as well as this Court's decision under an analogous statute under Sinclair v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.786" offset="355362">The Ninth Circuit's holding is incorrect for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.170" offset="372812">First, this Court's decision in Sinclair and its more recent decision in Kungys v. United States establish that the issue of materiality in a prosecution for making false statements to a Government body is a legal issue and, as such, it is properly a matter for the court to resolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.032" offset="452329">Second, the classification of materiality as an issue of law has deep historical roots in the law of perjury, and that law has always recognized that the question of whether a particular false statement is material raises a question of law for decision by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.536" offset="530278">That long history is critical in resolving the question of the propriety and constitutionality of deciding materiality by the court.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="107.300" offset="569358">If you were deciding it as an original proposition it would make sense to say it was a mixed question of law and fact, wouldn't it?</text>

          <turn speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="114.376" stopTime="170.533">
            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="114.376" offset="597674">I think that it might make sense in some cases to describe it as a mixed question of law and fact, Justice O'Connor, but the question of what kinds of facts need to be determined either in a perjury or a prosecution under 1001 is very different from the kinds of historical facts that we usually associate with a jury determination such as, did the defendant do it, and what his intent was.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.633" offset="694745">In a perjury case, the kinds of considerations that come to bear are, what were the issues in the prior trial, and what was the transcript of evidence before the finder of fact in the prior trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.700" offset="746990">Those kinds of factual matters are not really the kind of thing that call for a jury to sort out conflicting evidence, except perhaps in the rare case which arose in the 19th Century, when there was no transcript of the trial and there had to be some decision made about what the defendant actually said and what was at issue in a particular trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="170.533" offset="822327">In prosecutions under 1001 does it depend at all on what the issue is?</text>
            <text syncTime="180.628" offset="862660">If it made a difference what the Government agent actually thought about the form in question, that seems pretty factually related.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.738" offset="915114">I mean, how important was it to that official that an answer be thus and so?</text>

            <text syncTime="200.871" offset="943640">In a normal 1001 prosecution the ultimate question that the court is asking is, would the particular misstatement have the capability of affecting the decision of the agency, and the proposition to be established is, what are the agency's functions as a matter of law, what is it authorized to carry out and, in some cases, it may go down to a somewhat more refined policy level of what is the agency actually trying to do within the broad scope of its statutory mandate?</text>
            <text syncTime="232.904" offset="1071745">Certainly the question of what the agency is authorized to do as a matter of law is a pure legal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.497" offset="1098180">It requires the consultation of statutes, sometimes of regulations, perhaps of legislative history, but those are all materials that a court deals with as a matter of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="262.684" offset="1190863">There was testimony at the trial, more along the lines of the testimony that Justice O'Connor was describing, testimony about would the false statements on the HUD forms in question have affected the agency's decision to make a loan, that all came in at trial, and the judge then instructed the jury before the jury got the case that the issue of materiality was for the court to resolve as one of law, and there was no debate that I have seen in the transcript about whether the materiality element was satisfied in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="392.178" offset="1708923">One analogous area where the judge does decide a question that may turn on facts is whether a particular piece of property is within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, which is a jurisdictional prerequisite as well as an element of many offenses that the United States prosecutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.877" offset="1771722">It's settled that the court determines whether a particular piece of property is within the territory of the United States, and I think that rule would apply whether the judge was looking at a deed, or whether he was looking at a description of land and needed to hear some evidence about what that land actually entailed, so that is not a totally unknown process.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.311" offset="1857403">But our position here is largely one that is predicated on the long historical view that determining whether a particular piece of information or a particular misstatement is material is something that the court does do.</text>

            <text syncTime="469.477" offset="2018109">Do you just say, whenever it's to a Government agency it's for the judge, and whenever it's to a nongovernmental entity it's for the jury, and what's the rhyme or reason?</text>

            <text syncTime="479.965" offset="2060009">Well, I think that the line that history has drawn is between the materiality of false statements to private parties and the materiality of false statements to Government bodies, and we accept that line as one that has enough basis in reason to survive the question of whether it violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.456" offset="2137958">The basic question in determining the materiality of a false statement to a private party is how a reasonable person would react to that statement, and the question of how reasonable people do things has been in our system one that we've been very comfortable assigning to juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.607" offset="2206608">And it's, of course, assigned to the jury in the negligence context, and there really is an analogy between the reasonable person standard in determining materiality and the reasonable person standard in tort law that justifies certainly that long tradition of having materiality issues decided by the jury when they are to private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.930" offset="2279856">When Government bodies are at issue, in contrast, the highest level of generality of the question, and I would submit also most of the lower levels, or more specific levels of analysis, have to do with what that agency's policies and practices are, which raises a determination that in many cases is a pure question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.835" offset="2363552">And even in those cases where it requires some consideration of evidence about what the agency actually does, the ultimate inquiry focuses on what that agency's policies are, which is something that should not be resolved differently in courtroom around the country depending upon whether a particular jury accepts or rejects testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.098" offset="2448607">It should rather be resolved on a uniform basis, considering all of the evidence that's available, including agency regulations and policies.</text>

            <text syncTime="1449.499" offset="5938148">The second reason is that I don't believe that kind of a question should be resolved differently around the country in different courtrooms depending on whether a particular jury believes this agency official who says yes, we always consider this kind of... piece of information in making a decision, versus another jury who credits some former agency official who says, oh, no, that was never important to us.</text>

            <text syncTime="1636.121" offset="6684623">The Government for the first time has adopted this distinction of... between public and private officials.</text>

            <text syncTime="2263.962" offset="9196035">And I think it's curious to note that this case could have been prosecuted as a bank fraud case, and if that had occurred, the witnesses would have been the same, the questions would have been the same, the issue would have been the same, but it would have been submitted to the jury on the issue of materiality, because under that statute, bank fraud, which is certainly much more similar to this case than perjury cases, it is a jury question, and that's very well established.</text>

            <text syncTime="2795.578" offset="11322507">Mr. Chief Justice, in our view, there has always been in a perjury case the need to ascertain predicate facts in order to make a determination of materiality, but that has never meant to courts around the country that the ultimate question was a factual one that had to be decided by a jury rather than a determination that the court made.</text>

            <text syncTime="2817.042" offset="11408293">What about your opponent's argument that if that is sound, then we should go the other way, I suppose he says in the bank, in the mail, in the securities fraud cases?</text>

            <text syncTime="2827.100" offset="11448522">Well, I think, Justice Souter, that's the same distinction that we were discussing earlier between the effect of the representation on a reasonable private person and the effect of a representation on a Government agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.416" offset="11485825">In Kungys and Sinclair, this Court did ascertain what the particular governmental entity was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.580" offset="11510484">It ascertained that the INS was seeking to determine whether somebody was qualified for citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.433" offset="11529919">In Sinclair, the Court had to determine what the congressional inquiry was in order to figure out whether a question was pertinent to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.776" offset="11559281">But once it had ascertained those predicate facts, which I think are analogous, as Justice Breyer pointed out, to the determination of what the agency's program is, the ultimate application of the legal standard is one that the court can do as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.828" offset="11615496">Thank you.</text>
