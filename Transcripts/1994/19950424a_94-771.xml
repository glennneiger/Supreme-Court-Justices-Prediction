            <text syncTime="10.398" offset="198527">Mr. Rothfeld.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="11.510" offset="202916">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.292" offset="214096">This case concerns two Oklahoma taxes, an excise tax on motor fuel and the State income tax, that the court of appeals held could not be applied to an Indian tribe or to certain of its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.877" offset="256414">Now, I'll talk about those taxes in turn, starting with the one on motor fuel.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.711" offset="271774">In holding the tax invalid, the court of appeals applied what it thought to be a per se rule that precludes the imposition of any State tax whose legal incidence falls upon an Indian tribe unless that tax has been expressly authorized by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.358" offset="326318">Now, because the Court found as a matter of State law that the legal incidence of the tax falls upon the retailer of the fuel, and because the retailers in this case are tribally owned convenience stores located on Federal trust land in Indian country, the court of appeals applied its per se rule to strike down the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.401" offset="398520">We think there are three things wrong with this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.284" offset="413985">First, Congress has expressly authorized this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.988" offset="424852">Second, the court of appeals, even apart from the congressional action, should not have applied a per se rule in the circumstances of this case, and third, the court of appeals should not have found the legal incidence of the tax to fall upon the retailer of the motor fuel.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.727" offset="487755">First, Congress has, by statute, expressly authorized the very tax that the State has imposed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.111" offset="521296">The Hayden-Cartwright Act provides in so many words that States may impose taxes on motor fuel sold on United States military or other reservations.</text>

            <text syncTime="105.473" offset="578765">This is not a new claim or a new issue that's being injected into the case at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.665" offset="595588">This is simply additional authority for what has been the Tax Commission's consistent claim, and that claim is that the tax here is not preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.080" offset="621188">I think to consider that sort of preemption claim the Court typically in Indian preemption cases looks upon the entire body of Federal legislation and certainly the Hayden-Cartwright Act is legislation that deals specifically with the question of whether Congress intended a tax of this kind to be preempted.</text>

            <text syncTime="161.610" offset="803314">When you say, United States military or other reservation, I hardly think that that refers to Indian territory, apart from Indian reservations.</text>

            <text syncTime="170.913" offset="840512">At least, it's highly questionable that it does.</text>

            <text syncTime="178.550" offset="871128">Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.930" offset="872591">As I say, the Court had defined the term "reservation" to include specifically Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.625" offset="903415">As to whether these particular lands are covered by that, these are Federal trust lands, clearly lands that have been reserved from sale by Congress, and as the Court said in Celestine, the general use of the term is to refer to lands that have been reserved for any purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="234.276" offset="1094004">I guess there is some parallel here in the Independent Insurance Agents case that the Court relied upon earlier this term in Lebron, and the issue is whether the statute had been repealed, and that point was not argued even in the briefs on the merits or at oral argument, and nevertheless the Court found it was appropriate to look to whether--</text>

            <text syncTime="260.743" offset="1199853">It says whether principles of preemption or Indian sovereignty preclude a State from imposing a tax on sales of motor fuel.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.840" offset="1236215">Now, it doesn't seem to me that that really necessarily includes the idea that there's an applicable statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="275.273" offset="1257949">--Well, I think, Your Honor, that's a highfalutin way of asking whether or not the statute... the State statute is preempted, and again it's difficult to resolve a question of preemption, and particularly a question of Indian preemption which the Court has looked at the entire body of Federal legislation to see if there is an extant Federal policy that bears on the question without considering whether there is a Federal statute in the area, and this Federal statute clearly expresses the intent of Congress as to the particular point that's at issue here, so I--</text>

            <text syncTime="315.558" offset="1419072">Very often, the Court won't even address a question clearly raised by a petition, it will wait for a circuit split, but you're asking this Court to jump in and interpret this statute before anyone else has, and that's quite unusual.</text>

            <text syncTime="359.920" offset="1596600">I can't disagree with that, but I think that in this setting, in which the question is whether Federal law displaces the State tax, looking to the body of Federal legislation is an appropriate way of resolving that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.315" offset="1638187">And I think that it is quite clear that if the Court were to look at the Hayden-Cartwright Act, it would see that there is a Federal policy that deals specifically with the question in this case, and specifically provides that gasoline taxes and other motor fuel taxes may be collected by States on reservations, and again, as I suggested to Justice Scalia, there was no doubt about the meaning of the word "reservation" at the time the act was written.</text>

            <text syncTime="476.935" offset="2064610">We think that that clearly was wrong, and explaining why that's so, it's useful to start with three points that are not disputed between the parties in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="681.029" offset="2880989">In the Sac and Fox and the Colville cases, for example, the State imposed taxes, automobile and excise taxes and registration fees, on members of the reservation living on the reservation when there was the tribe living on the reservation who garaged their cars on the reservation, and the Court said that those taxes might well be valid if they were apportioned to deal with use of the car outside of Indian country.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.922" offset="2964581">The Court didn't say that the legal incidence of the tax falling upon the member of the tribe was dispositive in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.925" offset="2984538">In the Moe case, the Court also said that its decision striking down State taxes did not deal with the issue in which the receipts that are subject to tax are attributable to nonreservation sales to nonmembers, and the Court, I think generally, as in the Sac and Fox case, has referred to the rule in State imposition of taxes on Indians as a presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.039" offset="3061025">Such a presumption presumably may be overcome, so I don't think it's the case that legal incidence is necessarily decisive.</text>

            <text syncTime="807.281" offset="3385988">There is no case in which the Court has struck down a tax that otherwise would be valid, as this one clearly would be, simply because the legal incidence was said to fall upon the wrong person.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.897" offset="3420470">But there are substantial costs that are associated with a tax... with a rule that judges the validity of a tax based upon this kind of formalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.002" offset="3448891">It serves principally this rule, as what the Court described in Complete Auto as a trap for the unwary legislative draftsman who is not likely to be focusing on this program, certainly can't anticipate that years down the road a tribe is going to become a retailer or a wholesaler of fuel.</text>

            <text syncTime="997.506" offset="4146883">We think both of those indicate that it clearly is the consumer who bears the legal incidence, and I think that if the Court chooses to move in that direction and not reach the more fundamental question of whether or not there is such a per se rule, they can easily dispose of the case by finding that the legal incidence does fall upon the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.555" offset="4203098">Those two provisions I should know quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.877" offset="4208427">One of them is a definitional provision of the statute which refers to collection of taxes by both retailers and distributors, making clear that both of them were intended by the legislature to collect the tax from someone further down the distribution chain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.473" offset="4254821">That is confirmed by another provision of the statute, an exemption provision, which provides that purchasers... that's the ultimate consumers... who buy gasoline for agricultural uses are relieved of the obligation of paying the tax, again indicating that it is ordinarily the purchaser who is intended to pay the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.262" offset="4317933">So I think that is an easy ground on which the Court can dispose of this case, but I should return to the question of whether or not--</text>

            <text syncTime="1074.476" offset="4454814">That was the holding in Chemehuevi, and that is true even when there is no sanction imposed upon the retailer who fails to pass the tax on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.821" offset="4480205">That was the holding in the Mississippi Tax Commission case and First Agricultural Bank cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.642" offset="4495461">So all that the legislature need do to change the legislative incidence of this tax is declare somewhere in the text of the statute its intent that the burden of the tax be borne by the ultimate consumer, and as Justice Scalia noted before, that makes no difference in reality.</text>

            <text syncTime="1481.053" offset="6081093">As counsel for the Tax Commission has made clear, this case involves two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.887" offset="6104395">With the Court's permission, we would first turn to the fuel tax question, reserving the treaty question with relation to the income tax until later in this argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="1826.847" offset="7464225">and the Tax Commission relies heavily on the fact that it indicates that somehow retailers collect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.251" offset="7489929">We point out in our brief in chief that this simply requires a negative inference, that petitioner is attempting to draw a negative inference from this that something else requires payment of the tax by a consumer, which is absolutely not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.430" offset="7538622">We point out further that the provisions which are really definitional as to the incidence of the fuel tax are largely section 505 of the statute, specifically section 505C, and also section 506 of the statute, which provide... and these are cited in our brief in chief... which provide that the distributor is an agent of the State for collection of the fuel tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.497" offset="7642902">And we find, as we have indicated in the rest of our remaining brief, that as to those provisions, section 505C and section 506, as well as section 507, as well as section 502, there are numerous provisions which are ignored by the Tax Commission which establish the definition of where the legal incidence of the fuel tax is rather than simply carving out a phrase and basing their argument on a negative implication of a provision of the statute which is contained in the definition of "storage".</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.326" offset="7754184">We submit that the statute taken as a whole, in short, even though there is that possible implication, but it requires a negative and an incorrect implication, that nothing... because nothing requires a distributor, retailer, or dealer to collect, that something else requires that collection be from consumers, and there simply is no pass-through provision to consumers anywhere in this scheme, express or implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.461" offset="7850733">With respect to the agricultural exemption which is cited, and this is the second provision that is relied upon primarily by the petitioner Tax Commission, they are referring to the agricultural exemption in section 509 of the statute, which simply states that anyone who is claiming an agricultural exemption for gasoline to be used for farm use shall not be required to pay... "to pay".</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.287" offset="7934011">And we have indicated to this Court, having recognized the significance in plain meaning in text before this Court, but we have indicated that that word, which by the way was inserted in 1939... and we have researched the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.065" offset="7989182">There is nothing which indicates any intent to change the legal incidence of fuel tax scheme in 1939, but we have described that as colloquial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.350" offset="8014259">We also point out to this Court that in section 508B of the statute the identical provision with respect to the aircraft tax indicates that the exemption is one which can be claimed by the distributor, and other provisions of the statute are silent on this whatsoever, but the critical proposition that we indicate, and the critical provisions which we have cited to this Court which affirmatively establish the legal incidence of the fuel tax, are section 505E with respect to diesel fuel tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.866" offset="8120316">Section 505E expressly imposes payment obligations on retailers or dealers, and the only response that we've seen in the reply brief from the petitioner Tax Commission is, well, that only applies to diesel fuel, that's one, and secondly the Hayden-Cartwright Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.717" offset="8179771">Those are the only answers that they have to that, because it is expressed in that provision, section 505E of the fuel tax statute, that under those circumstances the diesel fuel tax is clearly to be... payment obligations are imposed on retailers or dealers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2124.654" offset="8655513">That... in 1931, Your Honor, the legal incidence could only be characterized as dual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.649" offset="8687487">In 1931, the Oklahoma legislative scheme was amended to include a situation whereby the wholesaler paid the tax but could, at its option, pass the tax along to retailers, and so both, in those situations, the statutory scheme at that point in time imposed obligations on both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.862" offset="8752375">In 1933, during the Dust Bowl, and by the best of our research, based upon what we found with references to defaulting dealers in the statute, in 1933 the incidence clearly is moved onto wholesale... onto retailers, pardon me, with wholesale distributors... what has now become section 506 originated in 1933... with wholesale distributors limited specifically to agents of the State for collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.213" offset="8837743">And at that point, they still, and they do still today, have an independent obligation to pay over to the State... to remit is the technical term of art which the Oklahoma Fuel Tax Code uses... to remit moneys to the State which have been collected from retailers, and there is a penalty in section 506 for embezzlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.006" offset="8912871">Not for tax evasion on the part of wholesalers, but rather for embezzlement in those circumstances where wholesale distributors do not pay over to the State that money which we have collected, but there are independent payment obligations on retailers also, such as section 505E.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.224" offset="8965743">So the answer to your question is yes, it is possible that they both have obligations, one to remit moneys that it has collected, as the statute says, as the agent of the State, and moneys which it holds in trust, the other the primary obligation to pay, but in no sense is there any obligation on consumers, and that's the important point that I wanted to make in response to the Chief Justice's question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2559.130" offset="10393387">But the answer, Your Honor, is that there is simply no difference, because Chickasaw tribal members, as all tribal members, are eligible for State services whether or not they reside in Indian country, so to the extent that the Tax Commission attempts to advance the proposition that somehow, somehow it is different for tribal members who live outside of Indian country, that they're somehow entitled to more State services than members who live in Indian country, this Court has already held in Sac and Fox and McClanahan that those who work and reside in Indian country are already exempt from State income taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.148" offset="10517521">And therefore the distinction, for this purpose, Your Honor, the distinction is simply a distinction without a difference from the standpoint of whether or not the employee of the Government, of the tribe, lives within or without Indian country, because under either circumstance they're going to be eligible for State services, and under those circumstances, there's no principled basis for a distinction for purposes of applying the treaty, even extending the treaty to cover situations which this Court has not yet ruled on under general law and Sac and Fox.</text>

            <text syncTime="2631.936" offset="10684600">I would like to begin with the fuel tax issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.180" offset="10693587">Our position is that the Court should resolve that issue by applying the principle that a State may not directly tax Indian activities in Indian country except where Congress has abrogated tribal immunity in explicitly... excuse me, in unmistakably clear terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.727" offset="10747817">Applying that principle, Oklahoma may not impose its fuel tax on the Chickasaw Nation's retailers, because Congress has not abrogated tribal immunity in this area, and because under State law the court of appeals reasonably concluded that legal incidence falls on the retailer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2690.885" offset="10920434">In other words, In Moe and Colville, Mr. Chief Justice, the tax... the determinative factor where taxes fell on the purchaser was whether the purchaser was an Indian, in which case the tax could not be imposed, or whether it was on a non-Indian, so there was legal incidence there, as in Chemehuevi, that was the decisive factor.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul A. Engelmayer</label>
            <text syncTime="2713.841" offset="11012280">I think the basis for the per se rule, which relies on legal incidence, goes back historically to the sovereign immunity that tribes have had under the... vis-a-vis the States under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.558" offset="11063167">It also, though, as the Court noted in County of Yakima just 3 years ago, has practical justifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.393" offset="11086468">For example, one of them is that it serves the goal of predictability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.576" offset="11103187">It allows both States and tribes alike to rely categorically on the presence or absence of congressional authorization in determining whether a tax would be or is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.390" offset="11142475">It also obviates the need for an ongoing inquiry into whether the balance of interests that at one point may have justified a tax has changed over time, if, for example, it is shown that only a portion of a given tax maybe is being passed along.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.319" offset="11194197">As I noted, there is also an historical dimension to it, in that it reflects the sovereign immunity the tribes have under the Constitution vis-a-vis the States, and finally, and perhaps this is most important, it leaves the States with considerable flexibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.819" offset="11252189">In this case, all Oklahoma need do is to change the legal incidence of the fuel tax to make sure that it falls on the ultimate purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.534" offset="11286984">That is what other States with significant Indian populations have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.977" offset="11300777">That's so they've administered their tax statutes consistent with principles of Indian sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.619" offset="11319376">I think this case is very much like Citizen Band Potawatomi, in that Oklahoma, having applied its tax laws in violation of settled principles announced by this Court of Indian sovereignty, has now come to this Court asking that those principles be scrapped.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.830" offset="11376218">Rather, I think the proper solution is for Oklahoma to conform its tax practices to those principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.303" offset="11402132">Now, I'd like to turn very briefly to the subject of Hayden-Cartwright, recognizing that it is our view that the subject was not raised below or in the petition and therefore should not be reached, but should the Court reach the issue, our position is that the act does not authorize State taxation of Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.625" offset="11467438">That, we submit, is clear from this Court's decision in White Mountain Apache.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.137" offset="11481440">There, the Court held that the act does not authorize taxation of fuel use by a non-Indian company doing business for a tribe on its reservation, this despite the fact that the Hayden-Cartwright Act explicitly authorizes taxation of fuel use, and the Court in that case reserved the question of whether the act even applies on a reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.910" offset="11560538">Our submission is that if the act did not authorize direct taxation of a non-Indian company doing business for a tribe on its reservation, it's awfully difficult to see how the act could then be said to authorize direct State taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.928" offset="11608604">Moreover, applying the unmistakably clear standard from Yakima and Blackfeet and Bryan, the tribe... neither the statute... the Hayden-Cartwright Act doesn't refer anywhere to tribes or Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.288" offset="11661998">There's no indication that at the time of the act, 1936, Indians were even selling fuel on their reservations, and there's no evidence that Congress considered the distinct barrier to taxation posed by tribal immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.054" offset="11713093">What the act does, I think, instead is to address and get rid of a distinct separate barrier posed by the territorial barrier posed by the Federal status of certain land, for example, military reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.642" offset="11759487">On the subject of legal incidence, just very briefly, we believe it's principally a question of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.376" offset="11786341">There are sound bases for the court of appeals decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.279" offset="11798044">In particular, as my cocounsel has noted, it appears that the statute requires that the retailer pay the taxes to the distributor for remission to the State, and it protects distributors against nonpaying retailers, but has no corresponding provisions governing the retailer-to-consumer step in the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.310" offset="11874112">In addition, there's a useful contrast here between other Oklahoma laws, which quite explicitly put legal incidence on the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.225" offset="11901802">The cigarette tax law that was adverted to by the court of appeals for example, and the special fuels tax law that Oklahoma has at section 702 and 703 of its code book, and it's cited, I believe, at pages 6 to 7 in a general way, the special fuel tax section of my cocounsel's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.325" offset="11970138">That also applies explicitly to the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.719" offset="11979751">I think some sort of a conclusion can be drawn based on the absence of such clear focus on either use or consumption in this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.153" offset="12009531">Finally, with regard--</text>

            <text syncTime="2964.723" offset="12015800">Do you know the answer to the question whether there's any consequence for Federal tax purposes placing the incidence on the retailer?</text>

            <text syncTime="2973.150" offset="12049446">Finally, our position is that the Chickasaw Nation's treaty with the United States prohibits the States from taxing wages paid by the Chickasaw Nation to its member employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.989" offset="12104826">Now, it's certainly true, as Justice Scalia pointed out, that the treaty says absolutely nothing about income taxes, or taxation of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.733" offset="12127813">Nevertheless, I think one has to read the treaty, as this Court noted in Choctaw Nation involving the very same treaty, from the vantage point of the Indian signatory in 1830 in the case of the Choctaw, 1837 in the case of the Chickasaw, those--</text>

            <text syncTime="3028.956" offset="12272741">It seems to me if you say that an Indian off of the reservation or out of Indian country cannot be taxed, it seems to me you would also say he cannot be regulated in any other fashion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3041.114" offset="12321329">--If I may respond this way, I think from the vantage point of the Indian signatory in 1830, having no idea that some day this territory would be... this land would some day become part of a State known as Oklahoma, or of any State, having no conception of this idea, even, of State income taxation, such an Indian, if they were trying to express the thought that no State shall ever interfere with the relationship between a tribe and its member, if they were trying to figure out how to put that in a treaty, it's hard to think of a more emphatic way than the language which the treaty uses, which is,</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.454" offset="12438671">"No territory or State shall ever have the right to pass laws for the Government of the Chickasaw Nation or their descendents. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.618" offset="12463330">The treaty also provides that where any well-founded doubt appears regarding treaty terms, it should be construed in favor of the tribe, and while that's a tenet of statutory construction that this court has used in many Indian treaty cases, this is a rare treaty that furthermore includes it itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.438" offset="12530622">Justice Ginsburg inquired as to the limits of this theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.062" offset="12541175">In our view, the limits of the theory involve simply laws that would interpose the State between the tribe and its members, in this case by actually removing part of the wages paid by a tribe to its members and thus, a property tax, for example, or a residency tax or a gasoline tax imposed on off-reservation activity.</text>
