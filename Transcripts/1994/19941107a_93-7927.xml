            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="151289">We'll hear argument now in Number 93-7927, Curtis Lee Kyles v. John P. Whitley.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.347" offset="184621">Mr. Liebman.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_s_liebman" startTime="9.057" stopTime="230.372">
            <label>Mr. James S. Liebman</label>
            <text syncTime="9.057" offset="187442">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.399" offset="200817">Curtis Lee Kyles is on death row for a robbery-murder he steadfastly claims he did not commit, and that his initial accuser, Beanie Wallace, did commit.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.484" offset="237180">The issue here is whether the jury had a reliable opportunity to assess the evidence on that identity question, notwithstanding the quantity of evidence that the prosecution suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.872" offset="278767">Both sides agree that the materiality standard of United States v. Bagley controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.645" offset="297784">Under that standard, Mr. Kyles' conviction must be overturned if disclosure of the evidence suppressed by the State would have created a reasonable probability of a reasonable doubt in the mind of one or more of the jurors, and a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.185" offset="363926">Although legally narrow, the case is factually complicated, and I'd like to take a couple of minutes, if I could, to give the background.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.620" offset="389735">When Dolores Dye resisted a thief in the parking lot of a Schwegmann's supermarket in New Orleans, the thief shot her once in the face at point blank range, walked to her car, and drove off.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.226" offset="436128">The State's evidence that Kyles was the killer was in four categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.980" offset="451175">First were four eye-witness identification of Kyles as the killer, all of them confirmed by an in-court viewing of Kyles standing side-by-side with Beanie Wallace.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.237" offset="488164">Second was the portion of a vinyl roof of a car in a blurry, blown-up photograph of the crime scene which prosecutors argued resembled Kyles' car.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.412" offset="524840">Third was physical evidence that the State claimed that Kyles had possessed but Kyles said he did not possess, mainly the victim's Ford LTD which Beanie Wallace claimed Kyles had sold to him, the victim's purse and personal effects the police found in a large, plastic trash bag outside the Kyles' home, and a gun, the murder weapon, found behind the stove in the Kyles kitchen.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.208" offset="612089">And fourth, then, were physical evidence that Kyles admitted possessing, a 2-inch square Schwegmann's receipt with Kyles' fingerprints on it found in the LTD and 15 cans of dog and cat food found in the Kyles' kitchen, some of which matched the brands that the victim bought.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.468" offset="677082">Kyles then offered the testimony of seven witnesses tending to show that all of the State's evidence was consistent with Kyles' innocence and Beanie Wallace's guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.014" offset="719296">First, one of the eye witnesses admitted she only saw the perpetrator from the side and back and had not identified a photo of Kyles in a photo array, and the other three eye witnesses who had identified Kyles in a photo array admitted that they saw the same picture of Kyles five times before they testified at trial and identified him in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.249" offset="808216">Second, Kyles himself testified that you couldn't tell the color, make, model, or any attributes of the car in the blurry, blown-up photograph and, in any event, it wasn't his car.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.836" offset="846564">Third, defense witnesses testified that they saw Beanie driving the victim's car within an hour of the killing and furtively changing its license plates, that Beanie had the opportunity to plant the purse and gun when he was at the Kyles' home and alone in the Kyles' kitchen on the Sunday prior to the police search on Monday, and then, as to the sales receipt, Kyles testified to hitching a ride with Beanie in the LTD to buy cigarettes and transmission fluid, and as to the pet food, his witnesses testified that the Kyles family kept a cat and a dog, and a police photograph was introduced showing a bottle of Hartz dog shampoo in a closet in the Kyles' home.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.490" offset="997238">As I will shortly show in detail, there are four separate reasons why there would have been a reasonable probability of a reasonable doubt if the State had disclosed the evidence it suppressed rather than suppressing and misrepresenting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.890" offset="1058783">First are the suppressed--</text>

            <text syncTime="230.372" offset="1072680">Before you get onto that, was Beanie called at trial?</text>

            <text syncTime="237.276" offset="1100370">But you assert that the defendant's main hope for acquittal was that Beanie did it, yet the defense did not call Beanie?</text>

            <label>Mr. James S. Liebman</label>
            <text syncTime="247.033" offset="1139345">That is true, Your Honor, and that is the subject of the ineffective-assistance portion of this claim which has been addressed in the lower courts and is part of the cert petition here, though we did not address in our brief, and that is--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="258.529" stopTime="263.433">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="258.529" offset="1185320">--purposes we have to assume that that was not incompetent assistance of counsel, I assume?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_s_liebman" startTime="263.433" stopTime="411.299">
            <label>Mr. James S. Liebman</label>
            <text syncTime="263.433" offset="1204964">--Well, on the Brady claim... that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.984" offset="1207158">On the Brady claim, we... what we assume is that had the State disclosed the suppressed evidence, the use of that evidence would be the use that competent counsel would make of it, but we assume that it would be the effect of that evidence in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.032" offset="1263374">The court below found that a strategically reasonable attorney would not call Beanie Wallace no matter what.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.959" offset="1295034">Now, on the ineffective assistance portion of our claim, we disagreed with that, but it is a matter of the determination of the court below, and in fact a number of courts in the State and Federal system have said in this case any attorney wouldn't want to get anywhere near Beanie.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.677" offset="1349996">You'd want to just present the theory that he did it and let the jury achieve a reasonable doubt on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.411" offset="1372879">I want to talk about the suppressed eye-witness statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.753" offset="1386254">As their photos reveal, and I have brought copies, Kyles and Beanie were facially similar in bone structure, profile, coloring.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.856" offset="1414675">Stood side-by-side, however, the two men clearly and distinctly did not resemble each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.382" offset="1436722">Kyles was a maypole, 6-foot tall, 125 pounds, Beanie Wallace a fire plug, 5-foot 5-inches tall, 140 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.158" offset="1471831">The controlling issue, then, was whether the witnesses saw the killer's build as the killer attacked the victim outside her car, or whether they only saw the victim's... the killer's face when he fled in the victim's car, and on that issue, contrary to the testimony at trial, the suppressed statements show that only one witness got a good look at the killer's height, size, and build, and that witness in a suppressed statement exactly described fire plug Beanie Wallace, not maypole Curtis Kyles.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.036" offset="1595338">Second, based on the chance discovery of a portion of a car's vinyl roof in the corner of a blown-up photo, the district attorney argued that Kyles' car was parked near the victim... near the crime scene moments after the killer fled in the victim's car.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.147" offset="1655838">Confidence in a verdict premised on this self-described key element... the prosecutor called it a key element of his case... is undermined by the State suppression of a police memorandum showing that, if anything, the police knew exactly the opposite of what the prosecution argued, namely that the police did not leave matters to chance, that they systematically listed the license numbers of</text>
            <text syncTime="399.602" offset="1749669">"vehicles parked in the Schwegmann's parking lots around Schwegmann's on September 20, 1984. "</text>
            <text syncTime="405.706" offset="1774016">and it showed that the petitioner's car was not on the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.320" offset="1792510">The list was suppressed.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="411.299" offset="1796481">I thought the rebuttal to that was that they didn't list all of the cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.082" offset="1811527">Is that--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="416.872" offset="1818737">--Is there a factual dispute about that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_s_liebman" startTime="418.975" stopTime="590.418">
            <label>Mr. James S. Liebman</label>
            <text syncTime="418.975" offset="1827096">--There is a factual dispute about that, but I don't think it's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.868" offset="1838695">The memorandum itself disputes the factual finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.099" offset="1855622">The factual statement was that they only searched one part of one lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.052" offset="1871400">The memorandum itself said, here are the cars parked in the Schwegmann's lots, plural, at the particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.577" offset="1897522">It was done by three detectives, and they had 19 cars, and the thought that there were too many cars that three detectives couldn't get more than 6 each is a little bit hard to understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.533" offset="1933362">Nonetheless, it doesn't matter, because the testimony was that the part of the lot that they did search was in the immediate area of the crime scene, and the picture itself, the blown-up photograph itself, shows the very edge of the crime scene, because there's the police cruiser right there on the edge of the crime scene, and you can see that the only thing that separates the crime scene from the blurry photograph that's obscured is one row of parked cars, so it's in essence the second row of parked cars over.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.781" offset="2038375">They took the list down at 9:15 after the store had closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.495" offset="2061258">One can predict that this car shown in the photograph would have been probably the closest car.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.378" offset="2080798">Certainly it would have been one of the closest cars to the crime scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.171" offset="2095949">So the finding was that they only looked in the immediate area, but the picture shows that the car in question was in the immediate area, so I don't think it really matters what we do with that factual issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.468" offset="2141088">Third, had the State disclosed only its evidence about Beanie Wallace, there is also a reasonable probability of a reasonable doubt, for the jury would have seen that most everything the police witnesses testified and that the prosecutors argued about Beanie Wallace was false.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.409" offset="2212873">It also would have shown that most everything the otherwise not entirely believable defense witnesses said about Beanie was true, and most importantly, that the police had substantial, affirmative evidence in their files that Beanie Wallace was the killer.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.060" offset="2271491">Finally, a reasonable probability of a reasonable doubt arises from the suppressed evidence, notwithstanding the only two untainted pieces of evidence, the receipt and the pet food.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.298" offset="2320393">Now for the details, beginning with the eye-witness identifications, and I'm going to focus here, as did the majority below, on the three identifications that seemed most reliable to the court below, because they were predicated on a photo array.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.036" offset="2375354">Although similar of face, as I said, as the photographs reveal, maypole Curtis Kyles and fire plug Beanie Wallace were unmistakably different in build, so the State's case depended on the witnesses' opportunity to see the killer before he got in the victim's car.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.568" offset="2445467">At trial, the testimony claimed that the opportunity was present for the witnesses, and the prosecutor then bragged in summation that</text>
            <text syncTime="581.004" offset="2475247">"all of them had an excellent opportunity to view the homicide and the person who did it. "</text>
            <text syncTime="586.487" offset="2497189">"Nobody changed his story. "</text>

            <text syncTime="719.533" offset="3029356">But what the suppressed statements show is that the witnesses, only one witness did have the excellent opportunity that the prosecutor claimed.</text>

            <text syncTime="755.408" offset="3172820">This testimony was very important to Smallwood, because he testified over and over again that once the killer was in the car, he could only see the side of the killer's face and nothing else, but as the State now accepts in his brief, Smallwood's testimony was false.</text>

            <text syncTime="822.992" offset="3443240">The only thing that was different was whether he actually saw the shooting, but of course nobody's disagreeing... there's no issue about whether there's a shooting and somebody got killed.</text>

            <text syncTime="833.298" offset="3484409">In addition, Justice Souter, trial counsel did attempt to impeach Smallwood on that minor discrepancy, did he see him from the beginning or only part of the way, and he did it by asking Henry Williams, who was Smallwood's partner, standing right next to him, isn't it true that Smallwood didn't turn around until after the shot was fired, and his partner says no, that's not true, so there was no way to impeach that, because you didn't have the statements which would have permitted that, but the critical point was whether they saw him out of the car.</text>

            <text syncTime="998.865" offset="4146665">He was standing at a construction site.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.406" offset="4156905">Essentially they were trying to get cars going past the construction site.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.918" offset="4166936">There's a lot happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.779" offset="4170385">He hears a gunshot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.429" offset="4176967">You know, in traffic and things he may not immediately know exactly what it is, and what he said in the earlier trial was that he didn't turn around until his friend told him, hey, look, something's going on over there, and that's when he turned around, and that's when he saw the person in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.752" offset="4250215">But in any event, he was very clear... the police explored exactly this point with him, and he said, no, no, no, I just didn't see him outside the car, only in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.920" offset="4282920">Territo's testimony, the second, is the same, is similar in that he testified at trial that his only good look at the assailant was when the killer pulled the victim's car around Territo's truck, stopped next to Territo's car, they exchanged looks, and then the car went on and made a right turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.428" offset="4348958">But Territo's contemporaneous statement was that the light turned green and the killer pulled continuously around him and made the right turn, and that while that was happening, Territo was focusing on getting the license plate number, which he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.487" offset="4397232">So this made the critical witness Henry Williams, who was, as the district attorney described him as his best witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.392" offset="4428788">He told the jury, this is my best witness, and indeed, by all accounts Williams did get the best look at the robbery and shooting, and a few hours later he described the man he saw commit it, and this is the description he gave at page 197 of the Joint Appendix a black male, about 19 or 20 years old, about 5 foot 4 or 5 foot 5 inches, 140 to 150 pounds, medium build, dark complexion, and plaited hair, short.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.868" offset="4534740">Williams thus gave an identical description of Beanie Wallace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.682" offset="4549996">On that very same day that Williams gave this statement, the police got information and reflected it in a police report that said that Beanie Wallace had committed another murder, and in it they gave Beanie Wallace's height and weight, and it was 5 foot 5 inches, 140 pounds, same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.993" offset="4619168">The description was not of... and also 21 years old, which is much closer than Kyles, who was a 25-year-old man at the time, 6-foot tall, 125 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.561" offset="4661487">So... and the materiality of Williams' description of a short, stocky killer, like Beanie Wallace, and not a tall man like Curtis Kyles, a tall, thin man, is compounded by the length the State went to conceal it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.626" offset="4709761">Because at a pretrial suppression hearing to identify, the defense counsel asked the chief detective, he said, I know you're not going to turn over the statements to me, but I want to know, tell me</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.146" offset="4759811">"in any single point, were there discrepancies in the physical descriptions given of the assailant. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.091" offset="4787606">and chief detective Dillman said that the only discrepancy besides a few years in age was 3 inches in height, ranging, he said, from 5 foot 8 inches to just under 6 feet, and beyond that he said explicitly, because defense counsel kept pushing, he said there were no other discrepancies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.670" offset="4853957">Confidence in the outcome is undermined, whatever might have been the case here had the State offered the identifications and then turned over the witnesses for fair cross-examination, on the basis of the eye-witness statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.650" offset="4905888">They instead decided to conceal those statements, which included clear evidence that somebody else had committed it, and to present demonstrably false testimony by Smallwood, and that simply cannot instill confidence in the outcome but only misgivings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1210.993" offset="4995227">--Your Honor, the reason I am prepared to draw that conclusion, although that's possible, is that State has acknowledged in its brief that it was false, and it seems to me that if the State can draw that inference, I can draw it, but the most important thing, obviously, is that a juror could draw the inference that the contemporaneous statement is the better description than one several months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.837" offset="5070564">I'd like to move now to the evidence that Beanie Wallace pointed the police to that seemed to implicate Kyles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.262" offset="5096269">In theory, defense witnesses explained all that witnesses by saying that it was Beanie who had the car at a time when Beanie said Kyles had it, that Beanie had furtively changed the license plates on it, and that Beanie was in a position to plant the purse and the gun when he visited the Kyles' home and was seen alone in the kitchen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.072" offset="5167531">The problem, of course, was that the State impeached all of the defense witnesses by showing that all of them were friends of the defendant and two of them had criminal records, and then the State's witnesses resolutely refused to corroborate the defense claims about Beanie, and in cross-examination the prosecutors ridiculed those claims and valorized Beanie Wallace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.264" offset="5240256">According to Detective Dillman in testimony, or the prosecutors in argument, there was no evidence that Beanie had a criminal record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.970" offset="5271080">That's a quote from the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.360" offset="5276722">Beanie had not informed for money in the past, they said, and he was a good citizen informant with the courage to call the police and leave his name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.265" offset="5308278">There was no evidence, the police said, that Beanie changed the license plate on the LTD. It was not Beanie who told the police to search the garbage for themselves but, rather, the police who thought it up themselves and, they said, the police did not direct Beanie to go to the Kyles' home on Sunday, nor, so far as they knew, did he go to the home on Sunday, nor was it logical, argued the prosecutor in closing, for Beanie to go to a house that he thought was about to be raided by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.783" offset="5414336">Every one of those statements by the prosecutor or the chief detective was false in ways in which the testimony of seemingly impeached defense witnesses turned out to be true, and so the jury was dispossessed not only of evidence that impeached the investigation in the case, the police investigation in the case, but also affirmatively showed that Curtis Kyles did not commit the killing but that Wallace did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.750" offset="5518198">And if I can give just a couple of examples of this, the tape reveals that... and the detectives testified in postconviction, that the police did not think up the garbage search, but that Beanie Wallace told them to go search the garbage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.611" offset="5585699">That the police were taking their cues from the likes of Wallace might itself have created doubts about the investigation, given Wallace's character, his prior record, the fact that he informed for money and all of that, he was a known murderer, admitted murderer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.507" offset="5633242">But the evidence is much more important because it incriminates Beanie at the same time as it impeaches the investigation for, inexplicably, Beanie somehow knew that only the purse and the bags and some personal effects... he said exactly that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.688" offset="5689980">That's what's going to be in the garbage bag, but the gun won't be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.020" offset="5707325">The eight bags of discarded groceries, they won't be... he knew exactly what was going to be in there, and he knew it 24 hours before the garbage bag even went out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.596" offset="5741598">Beanie's handler, Detective Miller, said, he admitted in postconviction that he thought at the time that Beanie may have planted the incriminating evidence in the garbage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.193" offset="5780050">That the detective could have thought that I think suggests that a juror could have thought that and formed a reasonable doubt on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.027" offset="5807322">In addition, Prosecutor Strider recorded his interview with Beanie in between the two trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.131" offset="5835743">In that, Beanie admitted that he did go to the Kyles' home on Sunday, he admittedly was in the Kyles home... this is all on page 262 of the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.287" offset="5872419">He admitted he was in the Kyles home and in the kitchen by himself, and he admittedly went there not only with the knowledge but at the behest of the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.214" offset="5912125">They asked him, they called him up, as page 262 reveals, and said, what about the gun, and he said, I'll find out, and he went over to the Kyles home, he left, he called Detective Miller, he went back to the Kyles home, he was there for 2 hours, in the kitchen alone, he leaves, and he meets Detective Miller by prearrangement on a corner, and they talk about the gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.208" offset="5996030">Detective Miller testifies in postconviction, we learned where the gun was from Beanie.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.892" offset="6018809">So what you have here is evidence that Beanie knew that he could get in the house, put the gun wherever he wanted, because the police were waiting for him to come out with information about the gun before he was... they were going to move in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.242" offset="6076174">Finally, we have three statements by Beanie which are totally inconsistent with each other in every particular, and what they reveal is a pattern that as each new fact came out that the police knew something, Beanie changed his story either to pin something more on Kyles or to blame a witness against Beanie with having been implicated, though that person had never been implicated before.</text>

            <text syncTime="1589.074" offset="6507508">There are really three things that the State might have wanted to prove with the dog food.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.608" offset="6529660">The first was, was it strange that Kyles would have pet food, and the answer to that is on the theory of both parties at trial Kyles' family had an interest in dog food.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.126" offset="6575740">The Kyles family said they had cats and dogs, and had four witnesses to say it, but the State's theory was that they took eight bags of groceries and threw out everything but the dog and cat food, and of course their photograph showed the Hartz flea shampoo, so of course there's really no question both sides were claiming that there was a need for dog food in this family.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.217" offset="6648151">There was an interest in having dog food in this family.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.179" offset="6659958">So then the second question becomes, is there something about the brands of dog food that is inculpatory, but there were three brands, actually four brands in interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.985" offset="6695171">There were two matching brands, and the two matching brands that she bought and that they had were the standard brands, Kal Kan, 9-Lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.071" offset="6723488">She, however, bought a third brand, and expensive brand for a finicky cat, but the third brand that the Kyles family had was a cheap brand that she... there was no evidence that she would ever buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.948" offset="6767060">So there were a lot of families in New Orleans on that day who would have Kal Kan and 9-Lives dog and cat food in their house, so maybe it's some evidence, but it certainly doesn't overcome the rest of the defects caused by the suppression.</text>

            <text syncTime="1684.478" offset="6889105">Finally is Curtis Kyles' testimony about the food, and all I can say on that, Your Honor, is that if you look at the Schwegmann's advertising manager, he confirmed every specific of what Curtis Kyles said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.727" offset="6938110">Kyles said, I went there, there was a little white shelf tag, the prices were two-for-something, three-for-something, I thought it was on sale, and I bought it, and what the manager said was, small white shelf tag, two-for-something, three-for-something, it wasn't on sale, but we used the multiple price because it made customers think it was cheaper than it otherwise would.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.490" offset="7013238">So the only discrepancy is that the manager said we used a sales gimmick, Kyles in a sense said I fell for the sales gimmick, but otherwise it's absolutely... and Kyles is a man of dull normal intelligence in this record, so it makes clear that the testimony was quite the same.</text>

I'll not argue that point unless the Court has some questions on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.888" offset="7194737">The principal issue in this case is whether nondisclosed information by the police in this case would have created a reasonable probability of a different verdict had it been disclosed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1788.038" offset="7303407">Both the U.S. district court below and the Fifth Circuit held that the evidence in this case was overwhelming, and they both analyzed the very items that counsel has been talking about here, and I would like to go into those myself and give you the State's perspective as to this same evidence, again on the thesis that Bagley is essentially the criterion we're using, and the law that we're working under.</text>

            <text syncTime="2797.366" offset="11340683">The State presented four eye witnesses, three of whom testified that they saw the shooting, saw the defendant leave the area, and some of them were as close as 15 feet to the defendant as he slowly drove by them, and they testified positively that this defendant was the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.298" offset="11412468">And after the defendant's attorneys took the position that another person, Beanie, was the perpetrator, the State brought all of these witnesses back, had Beanie come into the courtroom, had the defendant stand next to him, and then each of these four defendants again positively identified Curtis Kyles as the perpetrator, and they said that Beanie was not the perpetrator.</text>

            <text syncTime="2868.265" offset="11624269">Now, the defense, the petitioner here had complained about the statement particularly of Isaac Smallwood.</text>

            <text syncTime="2879.832" offset="11670558">When he originally was questioned by the police at the scene, he said, I heard a pop, I looked up and I saw this car coming toward me, and the fellow came very close to me and I think I can recognize him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.941" offset="11726982">Now, when they tried the case the first time, he said that same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2908.282" offset="11784347">Now, neither the State nor the defense picked upon... picked up on the fact that there was this discrepancy, and the reason, I submit, that they didn't pick up on this fact was that the discrepancy was essentially unimportant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.240" offset="11840249">The discrepancy involved simply whether... at what point he first started viewing the perpetrator.</text>

            <text syncTime="3286.373" offset="13296732">When the police came to Kyles' house, they found not only the weapon, but they found a holster for the weapon in a separate room, they found bullets that fit the weapon in a separate dresser drawer, they found a number of these things, which indicated that Kyles possessed this weapon, and that it would have not been easy for all this to be planted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.799" offset="13378443">But in... not just the weapon, the petitioner is claiming that Beanie planted the lady's purse in Kyles' garbage.</text>

I'm sorry, Beanie would then have had to go to Kyles' house the next day and plant the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3376.233" offset="13656177">That seems to be the way that police operate with informants, and that's not to say the State shouldn't be held responsible for everything the informant tells the police, but that's simply the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.341" offset="13704556">Now, with regard to the pet food, that is, again, a fairly minor part of the State's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.406" offset="13728902">The fact is, though, that when the police came to the Kyles' apartment, they found stacks of Kal Kan dog food and 9-Lives cat food, and that just happened to be the same kind of cat food and dog food that the victim traditionally purchased, so testified her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.207" offset="13800060">However, I don't want to take this out of perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.169" offset="13811867">Our case did not rely upon the pet food or the victim's purse being found in the garbage, or these pieces of tangible evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.995" offset="13847185">The heart of the State's case was eye-witness identification, which was strong and was never broken, in spite of vigorous cross-examination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3445.368" offset="13932657">The fact is that they saw this petitioner from the moment of the shooting until after he got in his car, drew off the lot and onto the highway and then even waited for a red light before he finally escaped beyond.</text>
