            <text syncTime="61.132" offset="378320">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="63.783" offset="388874">This Court is once again confronted with the task of having to borrow a statute of limitations to fill in in another Federal statute for the situation where the Congress has failed to provide a limitations period.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.132" offset="454284">In this particular instance, the statute is the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, or WARN.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.140" offset="486363">In creating WARN, the Congress took a right which already existed under the National Labor Relations Act for unionized employees... that is, the right to advance notice of impending plant closings or mass lay-offs, first standardized the notice period to 60 days, and then extended that right of notice to nonunionized employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.886" offset="589285">The ultimate goal behind both the notice provision in the National Labor Relations Act and WARN is to provide employees with the opportunity to do something to lessen the adverse effects brought upon them by this severe economic dislocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.148" offset="666398">The fact that WARN follows the NLRA model has resulted in the regulations which have been drafted to govern WARN coming to a substantial extent from the National Labor Relations Act, and has also resulted in numerous court decisions which look to the National Labor Relations Act to try to fill in the interstices of WARN.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.700" offset="748527">This Court in the past has counseled that in these type of borrowing situations, while there is generally a presumption in favor of State law borrowing, when a Federal source clearly provides a closer analogy and where the Federal policies at stake and litigation practicalities make that Federal source a significantly more appropriate vehicle, then the borrowing ought to come from the Federal source.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.482" offset="863675">In this particular instance, with respect to the WARN act, we believe that you have a National Labor Relations Act which is by far a closer analogy than any which exists at State law, and we also believe that the National Labor Relations Act both furthers the underlying purpose of the WARN act, that particular statute of limitations, and also would tend to avoid the kind of forum shopping and collateral litigation which would be inevitable if State law borrowing goes along with the WARN act.</text>

            <text syncTime="236.801" offset="1081014">I suppose you're going to get to this at some point, but will you comment specifically on why the NLRA is a better source, is subject to a better analogy than the Pennsylvania statute for payment of back wages due?</text>

            <text syncTime="253.581" offset="1148096">The fact that under the National Labor Relations Act one of the things that's going on is a balancing of interests... that is, the interest of employees in getting notice, and then ultimately in seeking some type of benefit to aid them in the event of a plant closing and a mass layoff, and what the WARN act is attempting to do is almost precisely the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.237" offset="1250705">I mean, ultimately there are differences, to be sure, but ultimately the purpose behind both is to give employees notice so they can do something to help protect themselves against the loss of their job.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="291.605" offset="1300234">But the notice to the National Labor Relations Board is to invoke the board's procedure so that it can preserve the bargaining context over the short period of time when collective bargaining agreements often exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.134" offset="1350284">It seems to me that's quite inapplicable to a money judgment, to a money claim for an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.558" offset="1379959">True, the employee needs it as fast as he or she can get it for retraining, et cetera, but it seems to me that this is much more, frankly, like the Fair Labor Standards Act cause of action under Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.248" offset="1434712">It seems to me that's the analogy.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Steven B. Feirson</label>
            <text syncTime="327.549" offset="1443907">Both under the National Labor Relations Act and under the WARN act it seems to me that the same goal is being pursued, which is not simply a collective bargaining goal under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.818" offset="1493017">I mean, yes there is a value in having the employer talk to employee organizations, but there is an end in mind, and the end in mind is to provide the opportunity to ameliorate the effects of a plant closing or a layoff, which is precisely what WARN is doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.179" offset="1554457">The FLSA does nothing more than say, the law says that when you work overtime you get paid time-and-a-half, and guess what, if your employer doesn't pay you time-and-a-half, you have a right to get the money that you earned.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.454" offset="1603567">It has very little to do with this notice notion, and the use of the notice to somehow try to buffer the economic harm that's going to occur to employees when they lose their job.</text>

            <text syncTime="379.294" offset="1650901">I may have jumped ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.554" offset="1656021">It's not clear to me that if we agree that a Federal statute should apply, that we should make the determination of which statute at this level rather than remanding, but the analysis does seem to be tangled at almost every juncture.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.878" offset="1737314">I suppose we look in part to how close the analogy is to the National Labor Relations Act in deciding whether to take the State or Federal law, but if we do that, then I think we probably also should look at the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="413.786" offset="1788932">Well, I believe the Court ought to look at all those acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.749" offset="1800740">Again, though, the right... there is a right that currently exists under the National Labor Relations Act which is almost identical to the right which WARN gave to nonunion employees, which is a right to get notice of a plant closing, to prevent an employer from simply saying on Monday morning the plant is closed, so long.</text>

            <text syncTime="457.334" offset="1963117">The NLRA requires the union and the employer to get together and to negotiate about the impact on employees when a plant closes, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.310" offset="1998957">In order to have effective effects bargaining, there has to be notice of the plant closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.793" offset="2020900">I mean, if the employer comes in, in my example, on Monday and says the plant's closed, it minimizes the ability to have effective bargaining, so under the National Labor Relations Act, for unionized employees there is this notice right.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.080" offset="2066039">There is this right to learn about the plant closing before it happens.</text>

I don't think you can call it more than a snippet of legislative history, but there is a snippet of legislative history in one of the House reports which says that the Congress recognizes that from that point forward the borrowing was going to be done on the basis of whichever State or Federal statute was most analogous.</text>

            <text syncTime="1724.356" offset="7031185">The choice that was seen there in determining how to deal with those hybrid suit challenges to arbitration awards or grievance settlements was somewhere between 20 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months, and the Court was very concerned in reaching its eventual conclusion to look at the range of choices that were suggested as clear analogies in both the State and Federal level.</text>

            <text syncTime="1797.076" offset="7322085">The statute is quite clear in giving the union standing, associational standing to seek such liability, and that is the basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.597" offset="7408185">We believe that Congress in this kind of situation plainly has the constitutional authority to provide such associational standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.185" offset="7454474">I have a dual obligation, however.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.829" offset="7481118">I'm also here on behalf of the North Star plaintiffs who were unrepresented, and obviously in that case you have an action by a group of individuals, each of whom plainly has standing to pursue the remedy that is provided, the monetary remedy provided to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.549" offset="7599923">I would emphasize, I know that it is not waivable, that the standing issue is not one that to this point has been pursued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.479" offset="7659692">It may well be the subject of a petition some day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.872" offset="7681216">In terms of the kind of situation we have here, it seems to us that it's important to note two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.911" offset="7737432">One, while the petitioners go back and forth, there is a norm, a Federal rule, and the norm is that State statutes are borrowed unless that would frustrate Federal policy or is at odds with the purpose or operation of the Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.910" offset="7849445">And secondly, that as I've indicated, this kind of cause of action for failure to provide wages, to provide employment, payment for employment or employment forgone, is a quite straightforward claim of the kind that the law has dealt with and that State law deals with normally by a range of statute of limitations which balance the needs of the plaintiff and the interests of the law and the needs of the defendant in an area of 2 to 4 or 5 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.099" offset="8026137">That's what the gamut of State statutes that were suggested here would provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.634" offset="8056335">So far as we are aware, and so far as the petitioners have shown, a State law with a 6-month statute of limitation for this kind of employee claim is all but unheard of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.515" offset="8119865">Secondly, we believe that the law in this Court is far more stable than the petitioners have suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.825" offset="8181096">Their argument in our view is really a one-case argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.521" offset="8215891">It's Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff, the RICO case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.986" offset="8249745">Aside from that, this Court has two lines of authority, one, State law applies, two, with regard to implied or common law causes of action that come out of or are brigaded with a Federal statute which has an express statute of limitation, the Federal law provides the rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="2125.189" offset="8634477">I think that the problem is that the petitioners are awfully cavalier about the unsettling effect of such a change on the decided cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.706" offset="8684632">Except if you're going to go back to a regime of prospective overruling, the cases, the 1983 cases, the other cases would have to be revisited if you were to change from a State law presumption with these narrow exceptions to a Federal borrowing regime in general.</text>

            <text syncTime="2200.488" offset="8935721">If we were at square 1, our only interest is that the search for the balance of interest and policies looks to the balance of interest that goes into statutes of limitation, not, as petitioners would have it, looking for a norm somewhere, anywhere, that looks like this norm without regard to what kind of enforcement system or what the purposes and policies behind the norm would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.984" offset="9097680">So I could not argue to you that the State law presumption or basic borrowing rule is of the essence to Federal jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.431" offset="9143447">I would only argue that it is... it has been established by this Court as the norm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.795" offset="9168942">It is read into Federal statutes as the intent of Congress except in narrow circumstances, and it produces rational statutes of limitations in this context whereas the suggestion of NLRA borrowing does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.241" offset="9262774">Beyond that, I can only say, as has been pointed out, that we're dealing with a wasting resource here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.737" offset="9292658">Starting for any statute after 1990 there is now a residual Federal rule, and against that background the question of revising the basic standard and unsettling those matters which have been settled, some of which drive a great deal of litigation like 1981 and 1983, may be a higher cost than is warranted in this case, where the State statutes really are very close to the most analogous Federal statute, which is the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2349.376" offset="9531313">Right, and I do think that when we have the discussion of the kind we do here about forum shopping and complexities, lawyers and clients should read the law books and do know the basic statute of limitations, and it is the rare case, one hopes, that these nice questions of perfect characterization come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.776" offset="9664851">That doesn't mean this Court can avoid those nice questions, but the essential point is precisely the one you've made, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.775" offset="9708841">From our perspective, when you look at this kind of claim, we ought to be found to have brought this WARN act case timely in just over a year, no matter whether it's a State borrowing rule or a Federal borrowing rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.537" offset="9795881">The NLRA analogy just doesn't fit because as this Court pointed out in Reed, and it would seem to us that it's difficult to come up with two cases that are closer in terms of a conceptual question of when you go to NLRA borrowing than this case and Reed, the fact that there is an overlap between the NLRA norm and another Federal statutory norm is not decisive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.605" offset="9956168">That isn't what this Court means when it talks about looking to the policies and purposes of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.900" offset="9993367">8(b)(1)a of the National Labor Relations Act covers a far greater fraction of Landrum Griffin title I 101 cases than the NLRA provisions cover with regard to WARN, and Reed quite rightly says that that isn't the test, the test is the policies that are peculiarly relevant to determining the proper statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.582" offset="10128054">The NLRA statute, as this Court explained in DelCostello and again in Reed, is a statute of limitation that has to do with protecting the formation and operation of collective bargaining agreements and private settlement through grievance arbitration, and to furthering stable ongoing bargaining relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.481" offset="10247695">It's not easy for me to face up to this in argument, but somewhere between 75 percent and 85 percent of the people covered by the WARN act are not governed by any collective bargaining relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.534" offset="10323868">The purpose of the WARN act is to give those people not a chance to work out a private settlement, as Justice Kennedy has already pointed out, but an opportunity to adjust and retrain by having sufficient notice, and we haven't even mentioned the fact that the WARN act generates a notice to the affected community, which is so far removed from any conception of the NLRA as to have lost all touch with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.309" offset="10474960">The fact of the matter is, as this Court has recognized, albeit in the preemption context, but equally to the point here, that they're two very different classes of labor legislation, labor standards legislation which redounds to the benefit of all employees and sets norms that are nonwaivable, and are the product of the rules of the State, and the collective bargaining system, which aims to add a layer of protection and to forster a private resolution system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.258" offset="10650816">The WARN act, like the Fair Labor Standards Act, like the Portal-to-Portal Act which is referred to in the legislative history here, is a labor standards statute which generates the kind of court litigation which has always been... for damages, which has always been covered in the range of situations by statutes of limitation of 2 to 4 years, not the kind of statute of limitation in the NLRA which has a particular private agreement, private resolution system in mind.</text>

          <turn speaker="malcolm_l_stewart" startTime="2672.956" stopTime="2937.952">
            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="2672.956" offset="10825628">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.253" offset="10870767">I'd like to begin by touching briefly on two observations which have been alluded to in the earlier portions of the argument but that I think are especially crucial to the disposition of this case, and the first is that in determining whether the NLRA and the WARN act are analogous for purposes of limitations borrowing, the question is not whether the similarities between the statutes outnumber the dissimilarities, but as Mr. Gold has mentioned, the question is whether the statutes are similar with respect to those features which would be especially relevant to the choice of an appropriate limitations period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.665" offset="11000439">And then the second point I'd like to allude to is one that Justice Ginsburg mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.869" offset="11017262">That is, it's not simply coincidence or a fluke in this case that the actions filed would be timely under all of the statutes of limitations proposed except for that afforded by the NLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.276" offset="11062820">Statutes on the order of 2 to 3 to 4 years are far more typical with respect to the filing of civil actions than is the 6-month period established by section 10(b), and I think that should lead the Court to conclude that there were some fairly unusual factors at work that led Congress to adopt the 10(b) limitations period, and the question is whether those factors are present in WARN act suits as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.521" offset="11155816">And I think the two crucial factors are first, as Mr. Gold mentioned, section 10(b), the NLRA generally is particularly concerned not with labor law in general, but with the process of collective bargaining and private dispute resolution under the terms of a CBA, and I think the contrast between DelCostello and Reed is telling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.195" offset="11234496">This Court borrowed the NLRA, the section 10(b) limitations period when it was dealing with a case that implicated private dispute resolution under the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.000" offset="11273785">In Reed it was dealing with the general field of labor law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.232" offset="11286741">It was even dealing with an area in which some of the primary conduct prohibited by title I was also an unfair labor practice under the NLRA, but the Court said in Reed that because the case did not touch upon the formation of the collective bargaining agreements or the private resolution of disputes thereunder, borrowing of the 10(b) limitations period was inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.147" offset="11378379">I think the second point that's crucial in determining why 6 months is appropriate in the NLRA context is that the filing of an unfair labor practice charge requires simply the filing of a charge with an administrative body.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.136" offset="11430310">The NLRB then takes responsibility for determining whether a complaint should be filed, and for prosecuting a complaint if one is pursued, and by contrast, a situation in which the responsibility is entirely upon the private litigant to file suit in Federal district court, the choice of such a short limitations period is less appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.678" offset="11508469">We recognize from DelCostello that we can't make the argument that borrowing a limitations period established for a limitations charge is never appropriate for filing a suit in court, because DelCostello held that sometimes it was, but I think if we look at the body of Federal employment statutes generally, we see a pretty clear pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.753" offset="11588821">Those statutes like the NLRA, title VII, the ADEA, which require a litigant to proceed by filing an administrative charge, typically contain periods for doing so on the order of 3 to 6 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.150" offset="11638350">Statutes, by contrast, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Portal-to-Portal pay act, which require a litigant to proceed by filing a suit in court, typically contain a limitations period on the order of 2 to 3 years, and I think this body of law reflects a congressional judgment that typically a litigant should have more time when the responsibility is entirely upon him to pursue his claim by means of filing a judicial action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.764" offset="11732808">The final thing I'd just like to touch upon, as Mr. Gold said, is that we think that the Court's presumption of Sate law borrowing has worked well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.321" offset="11771052">We think that borrowing State law in this context would not create problems of disuniformity and unpredictability that are so extreme as to outweigh the presumption, but if the Court was particularly concerned with uniformity, we think that there are better ways of accomplishing that than by borrowing the NLRA statute of limitation, such as borrowing the limitations period in the Portal-to-Portal pay act, or establishing a generic characterization of WARN act claims that would apply in all States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2940.774" offset="11896857">Assuming we agree with you, should we leave the judgment below in its present State, or should we send it back to the court and say, pick a particular statute?</text>

            <text syncTime="2966.139" offset="11998317">Well, I... with respect, I don't think it would... that the proper disposition for this Court would be to send it back to the court of appeals and ask them to pick a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.436" offset="12035515">That is, for the sake of predictability the Court obviously doesn't grant cert in a large number of cases, and when it does so, it typically wants to establish rules that will guide a lot of lower courts, so it might be appropriate for this Court to pick the proper rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.053" offset="12089954">But if this Court decides that it doesn't want to do that, then I think the proper disposition would simply be to say that suit would be timely under any of the plausible limitations periods, and leave it at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.063" offset="12134049">I don't see a value that would be served if this Court didn't make the choice, but asked the court of appeals to do so.</text>
