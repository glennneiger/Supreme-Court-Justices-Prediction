            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="7.267" offset="115929">The first case I have to announce for the Court is Interstate Commerce Commission versus TRANSCOM.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.505" offset="140798">This is another in a series of recent cases from the Court involving the Filed Rate Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.396" offset="160442">Interstate Commerce Act requires motor carriers to file rates applicable to shippers and these rates maybe collected even if the shipper and the carrier later agree upon some lesser amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.208" offset="207671">In Maislin Industries versus Primary Steel decided in 1990.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.034" offset="227002">We held that the ICC could not interpret the bar on unreasonable practices to prevent carriers from suing for the filed-rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.137" offset="259394">We reason that this would undermine the filed-rate doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.919" offset="270470">In the case before as a trucking company now in bankruptcy seeks through its bankruptcy trustee to collect liquidateddamages from its former customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.350" offset="304220">The ICC soon joined these collections because the carrier had not complied the certain ICC credit regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.331" offset="328148">The original bills did not advise the penalty for late payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.786" offset="341941">Revised bills were not issued within 90 days and the damages were being applied in the aggregate instead of in separate bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.859" offset="370257">All of these violations were in contravention of the regulations of the ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.491" offset="396798">The bankruptcy trustee defended against the injunction of the ICC sought and it sided Maislin.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.304" offset="419994">The District Court in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed with the trustee that Maislin applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.826" offset="438176">We remanded to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for further consideration in light of an intervening decision of this court that intervening decision was Ryder versus Cooper.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.356" offset="472239">The Court of Appeals adhered to its earlier decision, we again granted certiorari and we now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.330" offset="492197">The Interstate Commerce Commission can pursue those remedies necessary to prevent the carrier from violation as regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.064" offset="515080">Injunctive remedy sought here appears to the ICC and to us necessary to the effective enforcement of the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.784" offset="541934">Remedy serves to protect the regulations intended beneficiary, so our conclusion follows from our 1982 decision in Southern Pacific Company versus Commercial Metals and itâ€™s that decision not the Maislin case that is the applicable President here.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.441" offset="600553">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is accordingly reversed and the case is remanded and the opinion is unanimous.</text>
