            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="10.388" offset="187940">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.740" offset="201315">Under section 104(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, damages received on account of personal injury or sickness are excluded from tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.747" offset="237364">This case concerns whether back wages and liquidated damages awarded under the Age Discrimination and Employment Act are excluded from tax under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.232" offset="275294">A closely analogous question was presented to the Court just three terms ago in United States v. Burke.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.286" offset="303506">That case involved application of section 104(a)(2) to a back wage award on a sex discrimination claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.702" offset="333181">As the court concluded in Burke, although employment discrimination obviously may affect a personal interest, the statutory back wages remedy involved in that case compensated only the employee's economic loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.080" offset="386680">It provided no compensation for the personal components of the employee's injury, such as pain and suffering and emotional distress.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.137" offset="418967">What the court concluded in Burke was that a statutory remedy that focuses in this manner on the economic rather than the personal components of the employee's injury does not yield damages on account of personal injury within the meaning of section 104(a)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="83.665" offset="481034">Now, the analysis applied by this Court in Burke is also applicable to the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.610" offset="504858">Under the ADEA, there are two types of money recoveries, back wages of the type that this Court concluded were not excluded from income in Burke, and liquidated damages in an amount equal to the back wages award but only in cases involving wilful violations of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.753" offset="573403">Pain and suffering, emotional distress, and other similar personal components of the employee's injury are not compensable or even admissible in an ADA suit.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="117.277" offset="615513">But you do have a tort like remedy in the sense that you have in effect punitive damages, and that's tort, that's not contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="126.754" offset="653442">The tort like remedy is to be a tort like remedy for a personal injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.190" offset="687193">In deciding what was a tort like remedy in Burke, the Court focused on the absence of any remedy for the personal components, pain and suffering.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.318" offset="727630">The Court also mentioned jury trials and punitive damages, but those are very weak indicators of whether the underlying claim is a tort like claim for a personal injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="173.915" offset="842047">--What I'm trying to say is that in your concurring opinion you said that the majority holds that what determines a tort like claim is whether... is solely whether the claim remedies the personal components of the employee's loss, and we think that's the correct interpretation of Burke.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.157" offset="919056">As I was saying, punitive damages can be awarded even in cases involving economic torts, but the indicator of whether it's a tort for a personal injury is whether it provides compensation for the personal elements of the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.876" offset="977883">This is a common application of a very basic principle of the tax law, which is that because exclusions from income are to be narrowly interpreted, the... in determining whether the transaction fits within the exclusion, you have to determine whether it not only meets the form, but meets the substance of what the statute's designed to protect, and it's in that respect that the tort like remedy has to remedy the personal component of the injury because if it only remedies the economic component, then it may in form look like a personal injury, but in substance it's just an economic award and should be taxed just like all other economic awards.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="266.207" offset="1211209">But my question is, if you can bring both claims, as I understand you can, and this will cover settlements as well as litigated cases, then can't the parties manipulate themselves in and out of tax consequences by either putting the damages under title VII in their settlement papers or under the age discrimination act?</text>

            <text syncTime="299.597" offset="1344747">There is an ample body of case law addressing exactly what you're describing.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.521" offset="1364496">The Secretary, or the Commissioner, his delegate, looks to the substance of what the claims were in making the allocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.526" offset="1396469">Now, it is true that the allocation made by the parties is sort of, if you will, ordinarily respected, but if there's evidence of what you described as manipulation, certainly the Commissioner would reallocate the award and make a deficiency based upon what he... what she understands to be the substance of the party's claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="341.455" offset="1512244">I have to admit that's a very difficult question for me because I'm not 100 percent confident on the remedial scheme of the Equal Pay Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.471" offset="1548293">I think... well, let me assume that it's like the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.392" offset="1567937">I know that like the ADA it refers to some of the remedies under the Fair Labor Standards Act, but if it were like the Fair Labor Standards Act, where you had liquidated damages that were automatically awarded as additional compensation, rather than as, under this statute as a... only for wilful violations, even so, that compensation would not be compensation for the personal elements of the employee's loss in the Commissioner's view.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.863" offset="1681831">It's an economic compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.733" offset="1689354">It was... as this Court described in the Brooklyn Savings case, it was compensation for delay in payment of the economic damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="401.835" offset="1753720">I'm sorry, I really can't answer that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.987" offset="1766363">I'm just... I'm not sufficiently familiar with the scheme, the remedies, or even of the substance of the Equal Pay Act to help on that.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="412.070" offset="1794680">Well, my concern is that you take this panoply of antidiscrimination laws, title VII, the Equal Pay Act, the age discrimination act, the disabilities act, and they all seem to be remedying the same type of wrong, yet in some cases the award will be excludable and in other cases they will not, and what sense does that make?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="440.270" offset="1907529">Well, it makes sense in respecting the distinctions that Congress drew between those statutory schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.542" offset="1928531">We have to... the Commissioner has to be concerned with the application of this revenue statute to all types of claims, and the distinction that we've drawn, and that the Court drew in Burke, between statutes to just compensate for economic loss and statutes that compensate in addition for personal loss is important in applying the statute to all types of remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.548" offset="2020587">Now, in the area of employment discrimination, Congress has drawn certain distinctions between different types of remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.444" offset="2048172">We're simply respecting the distinctions that Congress drew, just as this Court did in Burke.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.094" offset="2066771">In Burke the Court said that a title VII recovery, which at that time compensated only for economic losses and not for personal losses, was not excluded, so I believe that the question that you're asking was really anticipated or was indeed the subject of Burke.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.406" offset="2136048">That's what the Court concluded in Burke.</text>

            <text syncTime="528.467" offset="2260287">It would be inconsistent with Burke to regard the disparate impact case which provides only for back wages to be excluded from income.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.806" offset="2309606">What happened in 1991 was that Congress provided additional remedies for the intentional discrimination case, the compensatory damages, including compensation for these personal components of loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.912" offset="2358089">In doing so, the Court... I'm sorry, Congress identified that claim as in substance as well as in form a remedy for personal injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.857" offset="2393825">For disparate impact cases, it provides only an economic remedy, just as it does under the ADEA, so in substance what Congress did was leave that as an economic recovery.</text>

            <text syncTime="590.748" offset="2509390">As I have already explained, the Service's only tool in that situation is to enforce what it believes to be the substance of the party's recoveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.344" offset="2543767">Sometimes you can tell.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.894" offset="2554007">Sometimes it's relatively visible that there's been a contrivance, but if there hasn't been a contrivance, I suppose what that would suggest is that the remedy in fact was for the personal component of the loss, if both were available.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.162" offset="2607088">Now, if I could get to this case, the courts below agreed with the framework of analysis that I've described.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.948" offset="2642197">They differed only in a conclusion that the liquidated damages component of the age discrimination act recovery was in a... was an indirect, implied form of compensation for the personal component of the employee's loss, but that conclusion is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.911" offset="2718056">In TWA v. Thurston, the Court explained that ADA liquidated damages are a double damages device designed to punish and to deter wilful violations of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.888" offset="2761942">The Court explained that the liquidated damages for wilful violations of the ADA are a direct substitute for the criminal sanctions for wilful violations of the Fair Labor Standard Act, from which the ADA remedies were largely drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.829" offset="2821710">So the ADA liquidated damages remedy is not an automatic award given as additional compensation in each case, as it was under the pre 1946 provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act that were involved in the Court's decisions in Brooklyn Savings and Overnight Motor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3290.755" offset="13309456">Just briefly, Justice Ginsburg, I wanted to point out that the irony that you referred to may be even broader than you noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.451" offset="13340176">In addition to the fact that, under Norfolk and Western, if the recovery were tax exempt the jury should be instructed of that, is the fact that under Brooklyn Savings, if the reward were excluded from tax it would be regarded as compensatory and therefore prejudgment interest would not be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.113" offset="13418856">Currently, pre judgment interest is allowed on ADEA claims because the liquidated damages component is regarded as punitive rather than as compensatory, but if it were regarded as exempt because it compensated for personal losses, it would fall precisely within the Brooklyn Savings holding that precludes prejudgment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.827" offset="13493671">There are two steps involved in applying this statute, as there are in almost every tax statute that provides an exclusion from income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.113" offset="13530869">Because such statutes have to be narrowly construed, the transaction has to meet both the form and the substance that Congress describes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.097" offset="13566814">The form of such a transaction in this context is the nature of the claim, the Threlkeld test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.621" offset="13592936">The Court went beyond the form of the claim in Burke and said it also has to meet the substance of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.615" offset="13616865">It has to provide remedies for the personal components of the loss, because otherwise, if it just compensates for the economic components, it doesn't fall within the scope of the statute as it should be strictly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.855" offset="13669841">That is the sum and substance of the Internal Revenue Service's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.848" offset="13689798">I disagree, and our brief reflects the fact that we disagree with the respondent about whether we had been inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.334" offset="13719787">I think that our brief... I'll have to rely on it for that, but I do want to point out specifically that since 1972, in rulings involving what was then title VII provisions and FLSA provisions, the Service ruled that if the statutory remedy only provides back wages and an equal amount of liquidated damages and doesn't compensate for the personal components, then it's not a recovery on account of personal injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.571" offset="13824695">It's not a tort like remedy within the meaning of the regulation or the statute.</text>
