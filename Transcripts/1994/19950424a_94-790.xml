            <text syncTime="23.926" offset="239551">Under subsection (a), the Bureau must first determine when the sentence began, which usually is when the defendant is received for transportation to the facility where he is to serve it.</text>

            <text syncTime="112.105" offset="592309">The supposition of the court of appeals is that because the sentence that remained was so short, and practically most of it was subject to the dispute of credit, that in order not to render the case moot pending the hearing that the court ordered, the defendant should be granted bail, and that's what the district court did on remand, and if we manage to persuade the Court to our view of the statute in this case, the result will be that he will have to surrender for custody and serve the remainder of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.720" offset="758761">The Third Circuit in this case rejected the Bureau's interpretation and held that the words "official detention" must be read more broadly than the Bureau does in order to include a court order that releases a defendant in bail but subject to a condition that he remains in a privately run halfway house under the conditions that the court termed "jail-like", and our argument in this Court has three principal points as to why the court of appeals was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.936" offset="907659">First, that the context of the statutory language indicates that Congress used the word (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="205.366" offset="965337">The second point that I'd like to make today is that Congress used the words 1984, and that it was by then settled in the courts of appeals under the antecedent statute that dealt with credit that somebody who was released on bail would not be eligible for credit toward a sentence of imprisonment, and the third point is that if... even if the court of appeals is right that it is possible to read the statute more broadly, the agency was not required to do so, and its view is reasonable, so it is entitled to deference.</text>

            <text syncTime="250.974" offset="1147776">There was a general rule that would have denied a defendant in the position of respondent credit even under the old policy statement, and in fact that general rule was cited by the warden when it turned down the first request by the inmate in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.586" offset="1214232">There was an exception that came out of a case called Waldorf, as we discuss in our brief, that was basically to the effect that if the defendant was ordered to actually be in a jail as a condition of bail under the custody of prison officials, credit would be granted in these circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="865.626" offset="3606421">Nonetheless, my answer to that is that by the time this happened the issue of whether somebody could get credit for time spent in a halfway house had been litigated in the circuits, the Bureau had a policy, both of those things had clear rules, and certainly that gives better notice to a person who thinks that he should be entitled to it than the rule that the Third Circuit came up in this case, which basically says that if it later should turn out that the person was held under jail-type conditions, then maybe, depending on the outcome of a hearing, he'll get credit.</text>

            <text syncTime="899.889" offset="3743407">You say that the Bureau had a policy, and there's a statute that could be interpreted in one way or another, but the rules are so careful, Rule 11, to say when somebody makes a plea, that the judge with meticulous care had to tell all the consequences of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.899" offset="3807460">Now here, if a man is in a jail and then gets transferred to this halfway house where he's allowed out only once in 150 days, the notion that he would appreciate that that is not the kind of detention for which he'll get credit, there's this tremendous change, maybe he would have said if that's the deal, I want to stay in jail.</text>

            <text syncTime="1167.453" offset="4813696">The first one is that Congress passes a statute like the credit statute with reference to classes of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.077" offset="4844207">It is not a question as to how Congress would really think of a case that comes close to a line in some sense, but that wasn't the class that Congress didn't think of favoring when it conceived of the broad class at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.359" offset="4909305">The second point is that, as we point out in our reply brief, being in the custody of the Attorney General, even if she chooses to put you in a halfway house for some period of time, is quite different from being in the custody of a private person.</text>

            <text syncTime="1292.245" offset="5312844">Once again, let me make the first answer to that question by emphasizing the answer that I gave to Justice Breyer, which is that it is not our contention that the credit statute incorporates in high verba the definitions of the Bail Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.958" offset="5383688">It is that in the context of a statute of this type, the word "detention" has a plain meaning that connotes a denial of bail, and that an example of that is the Bail Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.813" offset="5435097">Even if it were our contention that the statute simply incorporates the related statutes so that we were faced with the notion of this being limited only to the Attorney General, the Bureau has taken the view that it can extend that a little bit based on the legislative history of the '66 act which we mentioned in our reply brief, and on the settled practice, before the statute took its current form in 1984, which Congress chose not to disturb.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.605" offset="5558291">Now, I understand that if one gets to that level of the analysis, it is possible to quibble with whether the Bureau is right in taking those two matters to in effect impeach the plain meaning of the statute, but I would argue to you, Justice O'Connor, that if that's true, the remedy is to tell us, do not give credit to State prisoners, not to say that everything else goes, and we think that within all of the normal tools of statutory construction, we have a fairly coherent view of the statute that accounts for the fairly unique nature of giving credit toward a sentence of imprisonment that the other side simply does not have.</text>

            <text syncTime="1613.034" offset="6595979">I'd like to begin by following up on Justice Stevens' hypothetical and asking the Court to imagine the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.870" offset="6631401">Let us assume that on the same date that the court ordered Mr. Koray confined to the premises of the halfway house under a release on conditions order, which commits him to the custody of pretrial services, that there was a codefendant, and that on that same day the court ordered that codefendant detained under a detention order, but the court also recommended to the Attorney General that that codefendant be placed in a community based program or residence, which the Bureau of Prisons in its own program statement suggests the court may do.</text>

            <text syncTime="1670.283" offset="6825021">Let us assume the Bureau of Prisons takes that recommendation in this hypothetical and confines the codefendant to the same halfway house that Mr. Koray was confined to, and let us assume that both men, they may be dorm mates, they may be roommates, but for those same 150 days they are subject to the same, as Mr. Koray alleges, jail-type rules that prevail in that halfway house.</text>

            <text syncTime="3368.546" offset="13618111">I would just like to emphasize that the standard that was adopted by the court of appeals and is being urged by respondent is unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.980" offset="13651861">What respondent has done in effect is to ask the Court to come up with a set of essentially legislative classifications based in part on what would be considered probation under 3563.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.732" offset="13714869">In that connection, I would like to highlight, as we did in our reply brief, that if you took all of the conditions that respondent had in this case and asked what those would be called if it were a sentence under the Federal system, the answer would be that it is a sentence of probation, not a sentence of imprisonment, and I would refer the Court to section 3563(b)(12), which identifies what happened here as a permissible condition of probation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3428.946" offset="13859692">--Well, it shows as one of our statutory arguments, Justice Scalia, that what Congress was trying to do here was to provide credit for only one type of Federal sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.232" offset="13900861">This is a statute that deals with credit only for one of the many possible Federal sentences that may be imposed, and the fact that if we took everything that happened here and asked what it would be called if it were a sentence, and the answer is not what the statute gives credit for, we think it's a very powerful textual indication that this is not the type of case for which credit was contemplated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.406" offset="13993543">On the issue of lack of notice, I would like to refer the Court to 18 U.S.C. 3142(h), which is part of the bail statute, and has a specific list of matters that the defendant must be advised of when he is granted bail, including his duties under their bail bond and the absence or any consequence as to credit is not one of them.</text>
