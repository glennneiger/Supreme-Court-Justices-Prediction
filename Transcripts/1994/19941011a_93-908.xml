            <label>Mr. Carlton M. Henson</label>
            <text syncTime="10.387" offset="181985">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="14.433" offset="198181">This is yet another, and hopefully the last, in a series of cases involving the State's unconstitutional taxation of Federal retirement benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.024" offset="236529">Since at least 1985, when Federal retirees first filed suit in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.677" offset="259203">Federal retirees across this country have been trying to collect refunds of taxes that were illegally and unconstitutionally collected from them by the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.095" offset="292849">In 1989 in Davis, this Court confirmed that a State may not impose an income tax on Federal retirement benefits if it simultaneously provides an exemption from State retirement benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.074" offset="344781">Two years later in Barker, the Court confirmed that the holding in Davis applied to military retirement benefits, and in 1993, in Harper, this Court confirmed that its decision in Davis must be applied retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.945" offset="396190">Harper, however, stopped short of awarding refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.615" offset="410923">Thus, after almost a decade of effort by Federal retirees, this case ultimately presents the question of whether the Constitution requires refunds to Federal retirees under the circumstances here presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.843" offset="467870">This question has already been answered in the affirmative by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.217" offset="489290">As the Court held in McKesson, our precedents establish that if a State penalizes taxpayers for failure to remit their taxes in timely fashion, the Due Process Clause requires the State to afford taxpayers a meaningful opportunity to secure post payment relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.584" offset="558776">Further, the Court held that if a State avails itself of this approach, establishing various sanctions and summary remedies designed so that taxpayers tender tax payments before the objections are entertained and resolved, the State does not provide a meaningful predeprivation hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.984" offset="624395">Georgia does not dispute that it has established summary sanctions, summary remedies and sanctions here, nor does it dispute that the purpose of these sanctions and remedies is designed to ensure payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.994" offset="676431">On page 30 of the brief of the respondents, they write,</text>
            <text syncTime="138.649" offset="695030">"Georgia's statutory provisions concerning the nonpayment of taxes are all reasonable measures designed to see that taxes are paid if they are legally owed. "</text>

            <text syncTime="147.832" offset="731811">Well, Mr. Henson, in your view, what can a State do to ensure that taxes are paid without running afoul of this coercion, or whatever you want to call it?</text>

            <text syncTime="163.420" offset="794087">O'Connor talks about reasonably equal terms, and Harper references constitutionally significant duress, so by implication there's some level where there is constitutionally insignificant duress, or the terms might be unequal but not reasonably unequal.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.631" offset="870991">I don't have a specific formula to present to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.801" offset="887605">If the States are looking for a bright line rule, then I think parity is one that's fairly read from the cases, but this case is far beyond anything that the Court--</text>

            <text syncTime="688.130" offset="2892973">In McKesson, the Court described the meaningful predeprivation hearing again as the root requirement of due process, and when a State does not provide this root requirement, it must provide backwardlooking relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2574.323" offset="10437763">I mean, since you have no refund statute which happened to limit refunds to 3 years, is there now no limitation?</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.539" offset="10466603">And since you've interpreted that away, anyone who ever has paid this tax can bring a lawsuit?</text>

            <text syncTime="2594.767" offset="10519474">I think, Your Honor, the argument that the tax... that the petitioner in this case has made is that if we lose on the adequacy of our predeprivation procedures, that we are obligated to refund these amounts, and that all other taxpayers, regardless of any statute of limitations, are open.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.479" offset="10590319">Now, the Georgia... the basic Georgia tax scheme was in effect since the 1940's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.540" offset="10610590">Assumedly under that argument someone would try to assert refunds back to the 1940's, assuming they're still here to make those claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="2640.780" offset="10703585">But I think the question, Your Honor, concerning sovereign immunity, we've asserted that even if... even if Georgia's predeprivation remedies are found to be constitutionally insufficient, that that raises the question regarding whether a State can be sued in its own courts for monetary... retroactive monetary relief notwithstanding sovereign immunity, and I submit that that's a question that is very much left open by the McKesson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.487" offset="10822390">In McKesson, the taxpayer had filed an action under Florida's repayment of funds statute, and the Court was careful to note in its opinion that, under the particular facts of that case, there was a Federal due process obligation for the payment of relief, or backwardlooking relief pursuant to that particular State's post deprivation procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.118" offset="10916954">So the Court was very careful to note that there was the waiver of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.335" offset="10933776">The Court has indicated in numerous cases that absent a waiver of its sovereign immunity the States generally can't be sued in any court by any person on any cause of action, and we submit that that--</text>

            <text syncTime="2733.040" offset="11072643">We submit that the various immunities and similar doctrines that have been recognized by this Court generally demonstrate that there can be many circumstances where, because of qualified immunity, or absolute immunity, or the bar of the Eleventh Amendment, that retroactive monetary relief may be unavailable, and we submit that this is just such a situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2816.177" offset="11405130">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.630" offset="11414952">The limitation period that's applicable to taxpayers, for taxpayers besides the particular petitioner, is unresolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.674" offset="11451105">In briefs both parties have argued at different points in time in this case that the money had and received statute would be the most analogous limitation period, which would be 4 years, and would either... depending on when you started it would either be tax years '85 through '89, or tax years '84 through '89, and there is an issue with regard to tolling, because some 40,00 retirees relied on Georgia's refund statute, which makes you wait a year before you file suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.113" offset="11568865">So, for example, this suit did not arise until April of 1990, rather than in the weeks right after Davis was decided, so that... you know, in this case the State has not disputed, as far as I read their briefs, that the tax years '85 through '89 are properly before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.419" offset="11654129">I'd like to address briefly Justice Breyer's question, and that is the issue of remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.478" offset="11686312">The Court did remand in McKesson, and the Court remanded in Harper, and the State's response in both of those cases has been to continue to deny relief to the taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.192" offset="11729257">In the record... there's no evidence in this record that Georgia will do any better if those questions are left open.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.438" offset="11758201">Iowa Bank and the Montana National Bank cases are both instances where the Court said, refunds are appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.233" offset="11789339">The States have had a chance to look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.529" offset="11794563">The State didn't do... didn't choose an appropriate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.247" offset="11809401">The Georgia legislature has met in special session to address Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.339" offset="11825806">It provide only prospective relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.430" offset="11834165">The Georgia supreme court has had this case twice since Davis was decided and McKesson was decided, and still has denied relief.</text>

I mean, it's the same thing all over again.</text>

Board of Regents, it's 145 Georgia Appeals 471, a 1978 case, and State Board of Education v. Drewery, Drewery, 263 Georgia 429.</text>
