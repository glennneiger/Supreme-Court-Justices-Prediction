            <label>Mr. Richard H. Seamon</label>
            <text syncTime="1204.367" offset="4966736">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.025" offset="5009367">I'd like to begin by addressing a question that arose earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.329" offset="5030579">The question was, if there was so much evidence of drug use in Vernonia, why wasn't there enough individualized suspicion to make individualized suspicion-based testing effective?</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.201" offset="5074047">That question is plainly relevant under the balancing approach this Court applied in Skinner and Von Raab, because even though the Court declined to impose a least intrusive means requirement in its analysis, it is plain that alternatives to suspicionless testing are relevant to decide whether suspicionless testing is actually necessary to further the governmental interest that is being asserted, and I think that the limitations of individualized suspicion testing are illustrated well on the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.560" offset="5223571">Some of the evidence concerned drug use by individual students, and would have permitted individualized suspicion-based testing of those students... for example, the students from whom drug paraphernalia was confiscated, the students who were seen smoking marijuana in the coffee shop across the street from the school, the students who were arrested for using intoxicants at a party during the school day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.460" offset="5327121">But this was not the only relevant evidence in the record that there was a drug problem in Vernonia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.864" offset="5352721">The school district witnessed a two to threefold increase in disciplinary problems over the course of a couple of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.035" offset="5381456">At the same time, it witnessed the rise of an apparent drug culture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.505" offset="5399323">Students boasting about their use of drugs, whether true or false, was certainly relevant to the officials' assessment of whether a drug problem existed, and finally, the organization of groups with names like The Drug Cartel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.848" offset="5460659">Now, maybe the fact that a student belongs to a group called The Drug Cartel does not provide individualized reasonable suspicion for testing that individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.287" offset="5498484">That would be a debatable point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.406" offset="5506948">But the fact that such a group springs into existence at the same time that there is a two to threefold increase in disciplinary problems, and teachers for the first time begin hearing students boasting about drug use and writing about it in essays that they hand in to be graded clearly is relevant in assessing the existence of a drug problem.</text>
