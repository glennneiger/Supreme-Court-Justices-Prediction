            <text syncTime="758.588" offset="3185495">The rationale for the extension from State to entity was given in Justice Stevens' opinion as the protection of State Treasuries.</text>

            <text syncTime="1138.943" offset="4706971">In Lake Country, this Court noted that the most forceful evidence of autonomy between the Tahoe agency and the States was evidence that the States had to go to court to litigate against the entity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1167.260" offset="4820238">In this case, we had that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.811" offset="4830374">We have a situation where the Attorney General of New York went into court to compel the Port Authority to stop polluting the water around the Kennedy Airport.</text>

            <text syncTime="1198.882" offset="4946671">Now, the Port Authority in their reply brief indicates that the presence of this lawsuit is actually some indication of State connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.738" offset="4982093">They take the position that the Attorney General has to screen these suits, and the reason for that is because the Port Authority is related to the State.</text>

            <label>Mr. Hugh H. Welsh</label>
            <text syncTime="1456.988" offset="5979134">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.385" offset="6008705">For more than 30 years, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey shared the sovereign immunity of the two States that created it, and it was not until 1951 that the two States passed legislation that permitted suits against the Port Authority in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.915" offset="6066801">This Court has found that that conditional waiver of the sovereign immunity also contained language that constituted a conditional waiver of the Eleventh Amendment, and so when this case was filed beyond the 1 year within which such suits may be bought, it was only logical, then, for the District of New Jersey and later the Third Circuit to dismiss the case because of the lack of jurisdiction of the Federal court, because the Eleventh Amendment would bar this action being bought against an arm of the State in the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.142" offset="6187696">The Court over the years has considered many factors to determine whether a State agency is in fact an arm of the State entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, and I suggest to you that if one takes a look at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and its subsidiary, PATH, it's quite clear that it does share the indicia, or the criteria, that the Court has applied in a number of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.219" offset="6280065">If you take all of the indicia, all of the criteria that have been considered over the years, you'll find that they really come down to two fundamental questions, and one is, did the States create an agency that was an arm of the State and entitled to share in the immunity, and secondly, did they continue to exercise control over that agency and, in both cases, that is the case of the Port Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.941" offset="6366896">So if we apply the indicia from Lake Country Estates or from the Mount Healthy decision, both decisions of this Court, I think it's quite clear that the Port Authority does share that immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.760" offset="6410155">A number of questions were asked relating to the State Treasury test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.153" offset="6431784">Justice O'Connor asked about the limit of $100,000 on the State's obligation to the Port Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.699" offset="6465952">I believe what we were referring to there was an obligation at the time the Port Authority was created for each State to commit up to $100,000 each until such time as the Port Authority became self-supporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.449" offset="6528960">There were other times in its history that the Port Authority was supported by the States of New York and New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.772" offset="6554246">In its early days when there was a danger of defaulting on the bonds, the two States actually gave to the Port Authority the operation and control over the Holland Tunnel, and the revenues from that facility, which was built by the two States, helped to support the Port Authority, and then, since then, the Port Authority has been self-supporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.015" offset="6631255">The Treasury argument, or the Treasury criteria, certainly is not the only criteria that the Court has looked at over the years, but even if one focuses on that with regard to the Port Authority, it's quite clear that the Port Authority is very closely linked to the Treasuries of both of the States that created it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.069" offset="6711399">It's true that the Port Authority may not pledge the credit of either the State of New York or New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.180" offset="6731879">It's also true that a judgment against PATH or the Port Authority will not be paid for directly out of the State Treasury of either State.</text>

            <text syncTime="1816.548" offset="7417332">In Bolden, the Third Circuit, sitting en banc, considered a continuum with the Port Authority at one end as an example of an agency that was entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, and I think at Rutgers University at the other end, and they were trying to determine where on that continuum SPTA fit in, but they didn't rely solely on the Treasury... argument of the Treasury issue to determine that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.174" offset="7511895">The Port Authority over the years has committed vast resources to the support of the two States that created it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.750" offset="7542197">This was done through bi-State legislation that was passed by the two States authorizing and directing the Port Authority to undertake various projects, and we set forth a number of examples in our brief with citations to the authorizing legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.321" offset="7612414">As an example, the Port Authority has committed $440 million, $220 million to each State, to acquire buses that are being used by the two States for the benefit of their people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.598" offset="7657554">We have provided railroad connections when requested by the State, and we've committed $106 million pursuant to legislation to develop the so-called Oak Point connection, and this was done at the request of the State of New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="1950.753" offset="7954200">The two State legislatures have stated that one may not get an injunction against the Port Authority unless the action is bought by the Attorney General of the State, thereby limiting the actions that can be bought against the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.331" offset="8004460">The New Jersey supreme court, in a case entitled Evans-Aristocrat Industries v. the Port Authority, made it clear what the purpose of that provision was in the statute, and they stated that the purpose was to permit a State governmental authority, in this case an Attorney General, to screen the actions that are being bought against the Port Authority to assure that strike suits or similar actions would not be bought that would delay or prevent the undertaking of valid, much-needed public projects by the Port Authority.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence Allen Katz</label>
            <text syncTime="3157.192" offset="12779957">Justice Ginsburg, I'd like to begin by responding to one of your questions to Mr. Welsh concerning the difference between Fitchik, Bolden, and this case and Police Benevolent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.369" offset="12828649">I believe that the Lake Country decision indicated this Court's instructions that the Treasury factor, while not necessarily the only factor, is the most strongly weighted factor in determining these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.338" offset="12876506">The Third Circuit has recognized that to be true, as is evidenced by the formula that it follows in deciding its cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.472" offset="12905032">Amici for the Port Authority has also indicated that not only did the Third Circuit believe that's what this Court has said in its past cases, but almost every other circuit has agreed the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.297" offset="12940349">The problem with this case, the problem with the Police Benevolent case, and the reason that the Port Authority has been handled differently than the other entities is, as I discussed earlier, simply because the Third Circuit misread the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.246" offset="12992176">This Court can resolve this matter on a very narrow holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.929" offset="13006909">This Court can confirm that in fact, as stated in Lake Country, when determining whether or not an entity is entitled to the protection of the Eleventh Amendment, the State Treasury factors are the reason that some entities are extended that protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.706" offset="13058005">This Court can then find that the Third Circuit simply misread the statute and misapplied that constitutional formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.003" offset="13091128">Had the Third Circuit included those last three or four words of the statute, it would not have found that there was a discretion... or, I'm sorry, it would not have found that there was a compulsive requirement on the part of the States to fund the entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.209" offset="13140029">That is the narrow ruling of this case, and it goes to the heart of why there is that discrepancy between the Third Circuit's opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.514" offset="13165211">Mr. Welsh indicated the importance of the consent to sue statute, and its relevance in terms of the position of the States with respect to sovereign immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3263.011" offset="13203245">Mr. Katz, before you get off that question, why should it make a difference whether there is technically an obligation on the part of the State of New York and New Jersey to come to the assistance of a now-bankrupt Port Authority, or PATH?</text>

            <text syncTime="3399.177" offset="13747846">I direct the Court's attention and invite your attention to the fact that the Compact provides that all of the details for the effectuation, the financing, the leasing, the tolls, the rentals, et cetera, are within the sole discretion and are controlling conclusive...
