            <text syncTime="9.750" offset="125861">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and it is an interesting case that involves the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms beer labels and the First Amendment an unlikely combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.905" offset="186465">The Federal Alcohol Administration Act prohibits beer labels from displaying alcohol content.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.510" offset="212901">Respondents sought approval from the BATF for proposed labels that disclosed alcohol content, but this application was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.339" offset="260235">Respondent filed a suit on the ground that the ban on disclosure had violated the First Amendment protection of commercial speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.591" offset="289178">The District Court agreed with the respondent and invalidated the relevant provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.007" offset="314883">The Tenth Circuit affirmed and held that the ban violates the First Amendment because it fails to advance the Government interest in a direct and material way.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.602" offset="353230">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we affirm the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.924" offset="370576">We agree with the Government that it does have a substantial interest in suppressing competition by brews on the basis of alcohol content.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.846" offset="406207">We do not agree however that the Government asserted interest in facilitating the State’s exercise of their powers over alcohol under the Twenty-first Amendment is a sufficiently substantial interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.613" offset="461273">The Government has offered nothing to indicate that the States are in need of federal assistance in this area.Also, the ban fails because it does not directly advance the Government state of interest in suppressing “strength wars”.Other parts of the act that mere implementing regulations such as provision allowing the disclosure of alcohol content in advertisements and the identification of certain high alcohol beers as malt liquor, undermine and counteract the effects of the labeling ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.564" offset="589064">Further, the ban is more expensive than necessary, since available alternatives to the labeling ban, such as directly limiting alcohol content of beers were prohibiting marketing efforts that promote the high alcohol strength would be less intrusive to the First Amendment’s protection for commercial speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.480" offset="668790">Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
