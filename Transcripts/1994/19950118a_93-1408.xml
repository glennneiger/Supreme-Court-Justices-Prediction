            <text syncTime="15.426" offset="210241">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.128" offset="221003">In an effort to contain rising health care costs and assure wide availability of affordable health insurance, New York has long regulated hospitals and other providers in the health care marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.167" offset="265203">New York has traditionally regulated differing segments of the marketplace differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.387" offset="282130">While these laws may affect the prices which ERISA plans and others pay for health care services, they do not relate to plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.410" offset="314208">Any other result would severely limit the State's effort to regulate in the health care marketplace, since much State regulation affects costs and therefore may affect choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.533" offset="358721">In superseding State laws that relate to employee benefit plans, there is no indication that Congress intended to displace traditional State authority over the regulation of health care, creating a regulatory vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.358" offset="409921">However, if these types of laws do relate to plans, two of the assessments in this case which are imposed upon hospital bills regulate insurance within the meaning of ERISA's insurance savings clause, because they are designed to moderate insurance rates of certain insurers in order to support the underwriting and rate-setting practices of open enrollment and community rating which New York has determined allows health insurance to be more widely available at a lower cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.425" offset="522248">Traditionally, New York has treated different segments of the health care marketplace differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.412" offset="550146">Blue Cross, even before the State regulated hospital rates, was used by the State as the insurer of last resort.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.768" offset="579612">They traditionally practiced community rating and open enrollment.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.987" offset="592465">They enrolled people without regard to whether or not their age, their sex, or their health, and they community rated.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.909" offset="624125">They had one rating pool for a large number of people, thereby people with high risks whose insurance would be very expensive would be able to obtain insurance at lower costs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1789.676" offset="7307292">Congress therefore, when it enacted ERISA's preemption clause, used a very broad formulation, the formulation being, does a State law relate to any ERISA plan?</text>

            <text syncTime="1828.986" offset="7464445">The State's entire argument in this case comes down to the point that to fall within ERISA's relating-to clause, a law has to restrict or dictate plan choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2696.229" offset="10933506">In determining whether a law falls within the savings clause, this Court has essentially done two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.466" offset="10962450">First, they have looked at whether or not the law dictates any of the terms of the insurance policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.953" offset="10988363">For instance, Metropolitan Life, the law fell within the insurance savings clause because it imposed the terms of the insurance contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.325" offset="11017830">FMC, same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.175" offset="11025248">What it did was, it knocked out any antisubrogation provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.427" offset="11038205">Pilot Life, on the other hand, the Mississippi law of bad faith provided a damage remedy for any insured whose claim was denied in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.133" offset="11073105">Despite the fact that that law was intimately associated with the relationship of the insurer and the insured, this Court held it was not a regulation of insurance because it didn't actually set the terms of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.543" offset="11122737">The other thing... and in response to the question you asked earlier, Justice Breyer, let me explain why the courts have focused on the contract of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.749" offset="11167563">In 1869, this Court decided a case... Paul v. Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.135" offset="11189088">In that case, it held that the insurance contract was a transaction outside of interstate commerce and couldn't be regulated by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.158" offset="11221167">In 1944, in the Southeast Underwriters case, this Court overruled that decision, and held the transaction, the transaction being the contract of insurance, was in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.383" offset="11266097">In enacting the McCarran-Ferguson Act, all Congress wanted to do was to give back to the States their regulatory authority over the contract of insurance, and this Court has repeatedly held, in National Securities and a number of other cases, that the States do not have regulatory authority with regard to all matters affecting insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.212" offset="11353346">In fact, in Royal Drug, this Court held that the relationship between the insurance company and the supplier of medical services, in that case pharmacies, was not within the business of insurance that was saved, and if you look at this case, what we're dealing with here are laws that govern the relationship--</text>

            <text syncTime="2853.781" offset="11563684">When you say something is the business of insurance, it means not only that the States... it falls within ERISA's savings clause and therefore by that act States can regulate ERISA plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.322" offset="11609869">It means that the conduct at issue is exempt from the antitrust laws, and it also means, under section 2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, that any time there is a conflict between Federal and State law, State law prevails.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.130" offset="11657098">In other words, the normal rules of preemption are reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.181" offset="11669219">For all of those reasons, the savings clause has been construed narrowly, and again, I will just note, Your Honor, in Royal Drug, the practice at issue was completely about regulating the costs of an insurance company, what it paid under its pharmacy agreements, so that it could make insurance more available at a lower price, and this Court held that the agreements were not the business of insurance because they did not dictate the terms of the insurance contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="2939.620" offset="11907038">Thus, even if petitioners' concerns about the effect this case might have on the State's hospital reimbursement system were relevant to the issue of ERISA preemption, such concerns are clearly irrelevant to the issue of whether the 9-percent assessment is preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.897" offset="11968164">What is more, the State has conceded that the savings clause does not apply to the 9-percent assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.034" offset="11992719">Thus, the only question the Court must address is whether the 9-percent assessment relates to employee benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.639" offset="12023126">Where the 9-percent assessment is similar to the 13-and 11-percent surcharges is that all three interfere with one of the most basic decisions an ERISA plan makes, namely, how best to provide health care coverage to employee benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.232" offset="12085506">The 9-percent assessment interferes with this decision by imposing on HMO's, and only on HMO's, a penalty calculated at 9 percent of the cost of non-Medicaid in-patient care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.624" offset="12135034">Basically, what the statute requires is for the HMO to calculate all of its costs on in-patient hospital care, then Medicare and Medicaid get subtracted out, and what is left is multiplied by 9 percent and paid directly to the State outside the hospital reimbursement system.</text>

            <text syncTime="3016.952" offset="12216328">That is different from both other surcharges, both of which go to the hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.905" offset="12232210">One is kept by the hospital, the 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.357" offset="12241928">The 11 is cycled through the hospital back to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.476" offset="12254466">The exclusion of Medicaid is particularly significant because that's the piece the State pays, so the State said, well, we'll take ourselves out, and basically once you do that calculation, all that's left are essentially ERISA plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.051" offset="12308696">There may be a few individual subscribers, but well in excess of 95 percent are employer benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.973" offset="12336386">In other words, the 9-percent assessment targets one form of health care coverage and increases its cost relative to other systems of coverage for reasons having nothing to do with the actual costs of the care provider.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.114" offset="12384974">In the case of the 9-percent assessment, this interference is particularly egregious because of the unique relationship that employee benefit plans have with HMO's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.220" offset="12429382">When an employee benefit plan contracts with an HMO for health care coverage, it is purchasing a system of care.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.576" offset="12458848">That differs substantially from indemnity insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.694" offset="12471283">An HMO by definition is charged with maintaining the health of its members, not simply indemnifying them for treatment that's provided after the member becomes ill and needs services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.919" offset="12520184">Thus, every HMO has a network of primary care physicians who have the responsibility for monitoring and maintaining the health of the members, where they have the emphasis on preventive care.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.309" offset="12561771">That primary care network is integrated with specialists and hospitals, and the whole web of doctors, hospitals, and members are all subject to a range of rules that are intended to ensure that care is coordinated and delivered in the most efficient manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="3151.124" offset="12752987">It's not attempting to get the ERISA plans to choose Blue Cross over Travelers, for example.</text>

            <text syncTime="3157.444" offset="12778274">Well, Your Honor, the purpose, the stated purpose of the statutes may be somewhat different, but the effect is identical, because both sets of cases have the State imposing surcharges that are interfering with the decisions ERISA plans want to make as to how best to provide health care, and one of the things, again, that the statute itself talks about, is delivering hospital, medical, or surgical benefits through the purchase of insurance or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.797" offset="12899691">Now, surely the HMO's, to other types of coverage that are different from insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.669" offset="12931247">That is a choice that is specifically identified in the statute, so that even if the State's purpose with the 9 percent may be somewhat different, the effect on ERISA plans remains the same.</text>

          <turn speaker="harold_n_iselin" startTime="3306.124" stopTime="3493.881">
            <label>Mr. Harold N. Iselin</label>
            <text syncTime="3306.124" offset="13373030">--No, Your Honor, because what we have here for HMO's is the Federal HMO Act, and the Federal HMO Act on many of these issues acts as a sort of HMO savings clause because it specifically authorized States to conduct regulation of HMO's in many aspects similar to what we talked about earlier, community rating being one very good example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.656" offset="13459129">Now, that act was passed just 1 year before ERISA, and I think when you read the two together, the Federal HMO Act preserves for the States actually a fairly high level of regulation of HMO's, but it does not preserve differing assessments on what HMO's pay, thereby interfering with employee benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.569" offset="13542825">There are four specific ways that the 9-percent also very directly interferes with the choice, and since my time is running short, I'd like to talk about one in particular, and one result, when you increase costs in this way and it gets passed through from the HMO to employee benefit plans, is not just that the plans pay more, but they also can restructure benefits, increase copayments and, particularly important, sometimes plans drop coverage altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.887" offset="13652122">This is particularly common with small businesses, who might be right at the margin of whether they even provide coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.208" offset="13677408">An HMO tends to be the lowest cost option in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.278" offset="13693604">Thus, when we think about the impact, it's not enough just to think about it as increasing costs, which it certainly does here, but also reducing benefits, which is very analogous to Met Life, and in fact causing some employee benefit plans to just say, we have no more money to pay this added cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.740" offset="13767479">We can't increase our coinsurance or our copayments because they're at the maximum, we can't strip away any more benefits because we're at the minimum level of benefits that we can provide through the HMO.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.279" offset="13809692">The only choice we have left now is to discontinue coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.083" offset="13824843">And one of the ironic things of the State's position is that at the same time that it's trying to increase coverage, and is arguing for that as a justification for these assessments, the actions may have the exact opposite effect, which is to price some employee benefit plans, and particularly those of small business, right out of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.413" offset="13906241">Finally, I'd like to touch briefly on the Metropolitan Life case, because as some have noted, it's directly analogous here, particularly on the compelling versus inducing point, and again, one of the options in Metropolitan Life, faced with having to pay for the mental health benefit at issue, was that plans had two choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.827" offset="13995893">They could either move to self-insurance, which was directly recognized in that decision, or they could take this other option which I just described, which is to simply drop coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.300" offset="14037689">The law in Metropolitan Life, which the Court recognized related to employee benefit plans, was no more compulsory than the assessments at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.775" offset="14083665">Plans still retained options, and they could have chosen to exercise those options, just as ERISA plans here may have some theoretical options.</text>
