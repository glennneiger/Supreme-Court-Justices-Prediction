            <text syncTime="11.848" offset="195051">This 17-year-old desegregation case involves a remedy of unprecedented breadth and unparalleled expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.106" offset="228070">One of the remedy's central aims is to lure nonminority children from the suburbs to the district for the express purpose of altering the racial balance within the Kansas City School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.342" offset="273000">In pursuit of this so-called desegregative attractiveness goal and the companion objective of suburban comparability, one of the orders at issue here today requires the State of Missouri to prove that a quality education component of the remedy has produced improved student achievement.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.114" offset="344158">In the other orders at issue today, the lower courts have also ruled that the State must fund salary increases for noninstructional personnel of the KCMSD, again premised on the same goals of suburban comparability and desegregative attractiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.102" offset="408106">These rulings, and the underlying goals that motivate them, far exceed the scope of the violation found in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.839" offset="439035">They must be corrected to ensure that the case may proceed to unitary status in a proper and orderly fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.403" offset="469232">We start off with the proposition that the core mandate in one of these cases is to eliminate the racially identifiable schools from the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.671" offset="510401">That has been the focus since Green, and carried through in Dowell and Freeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.283" offset="528791">That test looks to whether the resources and the students in the district have been allocated in a race-neutral fashion to the extent possible, to the extent practicable.</text>

            <text syncTime="235.456" offset="1089484">We are asking for the same thing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.578" offset="1093977">We are not saying that everything that has already happened needs to be undone, but what we are saying is that the goals that are still extant in these orders, these interdistrict goals, go beyond the scope of the violation here, and when we are being held, when the State of Missouri is being held to those goals, that the Court must look at those in the context of the question of whether partial unitary status should be ordered and what the standards are, more importantly.</text>

            <text syncTime="489.525" offset="2105751">What the court of appeals did when it examined the State's claims on appeal was, it looked not only at that order, but it also looked at several other orders to try to ascertain from those whether the district court had properly analyzed the State's Freeman arguments, the unitary... partial unitary status argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="2260.059" offset="9187861">--Let me answer that question in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.033" offset="9199773">First, Justice Scalia, the district court did not find an interdistrict violation as it related to the suburban school districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.318" offset="9236971">They were let out by the court's June 5th, 1984 order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.282" offset="9260795">It did not find that they were complicit in the violation, or that there was any effect in any one of those school districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.516" offset="9285768">The district court, however, has made findings that as a consequence of segregation, black students were impacted in the Kansas City School District, and that the Kansas City School District swelled in black enrollment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.095" offset="9344073">As a consequence of that, the Kansas City School District ultimately was rendered unable to raise the revenue necessary to fund public education in an adequate way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.214" offset="9388481">As a consequence, all of the schools began to deteriorate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.374" offset="9401124">That affected all of the students in the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.578" offset="9410006">Let me use this analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.778" offset="9418783">If there is a school that is a majority black school as a consequence of segregative State action, and it is created as a majority black school, and there are still some white students in it, those white students will suffer the same effects of the violation as the black students or the majority in that school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.809" offset="9494852">That is the same thing that happened in the Kansas City, Missouri School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.013" offset="9511675">Eventually, the segregation violation overtook the entire district, and all of the students suffered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.095" offset="9532050">That was why the district court order was aimed at remedying the system-wide reduction in achievement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.520" offset="9557755">Secondly--</text>

            <text syncTime="2353.982" offset="9563606">I understand that explanation, but I don't see why it isn't an explanation that rests on a presumption of an interdistrict violation.</text>

I hope it will answer that question, Justice Scalia, and that's that the interdistrict violation was not found by the district court, but however, there are findings that white students left the system and went to public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.311" offset="9680948">Some left for the suburbs... went to private schools, rather.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.062" offset="9695890">Certainly, even in an intradistrict remedy, it's appropriate for, given those findings, which are not under challenge here and we believe cannot be challenged at this point, for the court to fashion a remedy that attempts to attract those students back into the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.264" offset="9760674">It's voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.476" offset="9765585">It doesn't run afoul of Milliken I. It doesn't impinge upon the autonomy of the suburban school districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.550" offset="9801843">It also aims at attracting students back into the system who are in private schools within the boundaries of the Kansas City, Missouri School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.955" offset="9831518">That doesn't in any way implicate the interdistrict violation concerns that Milliken I addresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.539" offset="9853774">That's why we lost on interdistrict relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2555.993" offset="10371626">It also stressed, I think, contrary to what I believe the State's representations to be, that it was contemplating this transition to a system in which the Kansas City, Missouri School District would be largely responsible, or wholly responsible, for funding whatever components of the remedy are left in place, and it would have to consider that consistent with the fact that the State would no longer be in as a defendant that was funding the remedy.</text>

I would think that the first thing you would want to do is compare... let's take this hypothetical tenth grade student now, or tenth grade students in general in the system, and see whether their performance, general academic performance, is comparable with students in systems in other cities of similar size and demographics that had not suffered from the terrible deprivations that segregation caused here.</text>
