            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="10.222" offset="181957">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.074" offset="193346">In these two consolidated cases, the Eleventh Circuit overruled its own prior decision in Taylor v. General Motors, an airbags case, to hold that conflict preemption may not be implied under the Safety Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.750" offset="252069">Thereby, it reversed grants of summary judgment in two district courts below and allowed the plaintiffs, the respondents here, to claim that under Georgia tort law it may be claimed to be a design defect for manufacturers not to incorporate antilock devices in their airbrake systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.485" offset="363037">Though the First, Third, and Tenth Circuits, like the Eleventh Circuit, had held previously that conflict preemption may be implied under the Safety Act, the Eleventh Circuit believed that this Court's decision in Cipollone v. Liggett Group required a different rule because there had been express attention to the subject of preemption in the act, thereby virtually foreclosing any further inquiry into implied or conflict preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.789" offset="488216">We believe that is wrong, and that express preemption does not virtually foreclose inquiry into implied preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.276" offset="518205">We also believe that it is wrong to say that section 39... 1397 saves inconsistent State law, including tort law.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.650" offset="559687">Before explaining why there is indeed an incompatibility here between allowing a Georgia jury to find a design defect and the Safety Act, I'd like to say just one very brief word about why the Eleventh Circuit rule is surely incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.064" offset="637323">If that rule were correct, then it would compel Congress, every time it legislates, to add a "we mean it" clause, a clause which says, and, of course, we preempt all inconsistent and incompatible State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.174" offset="705764">Such a boilerplate clause would add nothing to the Supremacy Clause, nor would it subtract anything from the burdens on this Court, the task of this Court, in determining what State laws are and are not incompatible.</text>

            <text syncTime="157.385" offset="770548">Mr. Fried, even if we accept your position on that, we have here an express preemption clause, as I understand it, and it preempts State standards applicable to a particular aspect of performance addressed by a Federal standard that is in effect, and as I understand it, there is no Federal standard in effect now on antilock brakes, and how can there be express preemption?</text>

            <text syncTime="218.007" offset="1013068">That's the Ilsa Petroleum case, in which this Court said that a preempted inference is not to be drawn by inaction alone, to be sure, but from inaction joined with action, and what I'd like to do is indicate to you that there was in this case both action and inaction, and that those two together in fact constitute a Federal determination that it is dangerous... not simply unwarranted, but dangerous, or potentially dangerous, to require the incorporation of antilock brakes in... antilock devices in airbrake systems.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael H. Gottesman</label>
            <text syncTime="1602.324" offset="6550296">Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.943" offset="6568791">It may be well to recall what this lawsuit in Georgia alleges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.330" offset="6590420">It alleges that these two trucks, the trucks that... one truck that killed Mrs. Lindsey, the other that maimed Mr. Myrick, these two trucks were not designed as safely as they might have been, and it alleges that by the time these two trucks were manufactured, which was many, many years after the record that the Ninth Circuit was reviewing, 7 years in the case of one truck and 12 years in the case of the other, that at that time there were available safe antilock brakes, and that those brakes would have been safer than the brake system that was chosen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.972" offset="6748931">Now, at the core of this case, and I think it is reflected by the discussion so far, is the question of whether there is any Federal determination with which this lawsuit, if it were won by the plaintiffs, would conflict, and recall, the plaintiffs haven't won this lawsuit yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.451" offset="6822805">They are going to have to prove that in fact by 1982 or 1987 there were, in fact, safety devices that would have made this truck safer with an antilock device.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.109" offset="6873483">So the preemption issue has to be considered on the hypothesis that such evidence could be presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.430" offset="6898770">If it's not, the Georgia courts are obviously not going to find for the plaintiffs, and so we focus on that question first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.655" offset="6943700">Now, the jumping off point is a proposition that all the parties here, including the United States, agree on, and I'll give you the petitioner's formulation of that point, because I think it's one that we all agree on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.111" offset="6989467">Conflict preemption could not exist, of course, where there was no Federal determination on the specific subject, so that's the petitioner's formulation of what's involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.353" offset="7042443">And so the question we have is whether there is a Federal determination on the specific subject of whether antilock brakes are unsafe in cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.078" offset="7085388">Now, there once was a specific judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.613" offset="7099494">Obviously, the initial regulation by the agency said, you must have them, because we believe they are safer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.117" offset="7125512">Plainly, if that regulation had remained in effect, this lawsuit would not be preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.088" offset="7145365">It would be entirely consistent with the Federal regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1775.719" offset="7243899">We do, Your Honor, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.488" offset="7251005">First of all, the question presented necessarily subsumes that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.123" offset="7265529">It says, whether the act preempts State common law standards that conflict with Federal standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.094" offset="7289457">Implicit is that in the point that they have to, as part of that, demonstrate that there is a conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.848" offset="7316415">In the brief in opposition at page 26, we expressly pointed out to the Court that it is our contention that there is no conflict, and the proposition made on that point was made actually more broadly in the brief in opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.690" offset="7375765">Beginning on page 21 is the caption,</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.040" offset="7385170">"Respondent's Common Law Claims Do Not Conflict With the Safety Act, Nor With Standard 121. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.777" offset="7408157">and on page 26, the precise point that we're making here is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.014" offset="7429055">That is, that the present status of the Federal regulations is that they don't preclude antilock brakes, but they impose no requirement one way or the other, that in that context, there is no conflict if Georgia says well, we encourage you, or at least we will award tort damages against you, if you don't have them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.262" offset="7514110">So the issue is properly preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.213" offset="7521947">It is a ground that would sustain the decision below, and I think really this point is also the point that goes to the question of express preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.985" offset="7556951">I think the two are really the same, and that is, whether there is, in fact, a conflict between what the State is doing and what the Federal regulations say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.175" offset="7597702">Is there a Federal regulation in effect that would be... would comprehend the point that the Georgia courts are being asked to decide in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.633" offset="7639602">And the regulation as it presently stands says that as to the aspects of performance which are involved here, the ability of a truck to stop within a certain distance at a certain speed, and the ability to do so without jackknifing or skidding, what is sometimes called vehicle stability, as to those aspects, those were dealt with in the original regulation, and each of the provisions that dealt with those aspects of performance is now declared not to be applicable to trucks and trailers, so the present state of the regulatory record is that there is no regulation that deals with those aspects of performance of trucks, the ones which the Ninth Circuit said effectively required antilock brakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.982" offset="7840954">Now, the petitioners say, well, but that gives us an option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.720" offset="7863942">Well, of course it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.636" offset="7867599">Whenever there's no regulation in effect, they... the Government has chosen not to regulate something, they enjoy the options that all citizens do, to do whatever is not regulated, but that hardly constitutes a Federal interest that Congress would have wanted to preempt, or that it did preempt on the face of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.697" offset="7943877">Now, petitioner's argument ultimately depends on its trying to infuse the statement, there is no regulation applicable to trucks and trailers, with the Ninth Circuit's reasons for requiring that they suspend their earlier regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.076" offset="8013362">Now, the first proposition, of course, is that the Ninth Circuit doesn't have the power to preempt, only the agency does, and the agency has said there's no regulation in effect applicable to trucks and trailers, but the second point is, this is an overreading in any event of what the Ninth Circuit said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.620" offset="8083579">The Ninth Circuit said that it was convinced from the record that antilock brakes promised greater safety in trucks, and it said to a large degree, these devices were already perfected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.178" offset="8133734">It said, but there were some trucks, a substantial number, for which it was a potential hazard, and it said the reason this regulation, which required all trucks to have safety devices, was... had to be suspended is because it did not distinguish between those on which it was safe and those that were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.325" offset="8214401">You can't have a regulation, said the Ninth Circuit, requiring that all trucks have antilock brakes if some trucks would be potentially dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.681" offset="8251808">There had not actually been any injury with these, but there was the "potential" because some manufacturers were saying, "We're having problems".</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.370" offset="8278557">And again, from petitioners' brief, they say, uniform requirements on all trucks in all their variety of configurations is what the Ninth Circuit condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.011" offset="8325055">You can't have a uniform blanket requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.963" offset="8336863">So the Ninth Circuit didn't say that antilocks are unsafe on all trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.701" offset="8359850">It said, they're unsafe on some trucks, and some trucks based on a record that was made in 1975, long before these trucks were manufactured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.222" offset="8401960">Now, our lawsuit is not seeking a determination that all trucks must have antilocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.976" offset="8428918">Our lawsuit contends that these two trucks would have been safer if they had antilocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.714" offset="8451906">We have to prove that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.065" offset="8457339">What the Ninth Circuit said is not at all inconsistent with our proving that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.803" offset="8480223">First of all, they recognized even then that many trucks would be safe with antilocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.105" offset="8497463">Secondly, this is 7 and 12 years later, and as everybody's briefs point out, there has been what is called a second generation of antilock devices which are safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.729" offset="8539991">There has been a huge increase in the actual usage by manufacturers of antilock devices, even though they're not required to do so by the present regulation, and so nothing in the Ninth Circuit, even if you were to read the Ninth Circuit opinion as though it, in heightened verbal, appeared here as an explanation for the withdrawal of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.159" offset="8625672">That would suggest nothing that says the Ninth Circuit has any disposition not to recognize this lawsuit, or to find it inconsistent with the Federal interest, and, of course, the interested agencies are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.884" offset="8672588">The interested agency, I should say, NHTSA, is here, telling you that there is no impeding of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.639" offset="8703622">There's no express preemption, there's no implied preemption in this case, because there is no Federal interest with which this collides, and there is no regulation on this aspect of performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.928" offset="8748761">We withdrew it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.364" offset="8754508">Now, petitioner says, but there's some other provision that says, if you choose antilock brakes, then you must have them conform electrically to what's required, so they say, see, there is some regulation of antilock brakes in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.861" offset="8836533">But the preemption provision of this statute doesn't say, if they regulate that item of equipment the States can't act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.935" offset="8880837">The preemption provision says, if they regulate an aspect of performance of an item of equipment, the State can't act, and in this case, the item of equipment is antilock brakes, and they have not regulated the performance standards that are at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.647" offset="8959622">Now, we have not yet gotten to the question of whether the savings clause would in any event sustain this lawsuit even if there were some conflict, but we do want to point out to the Court that the savings clause in this case, by its terms, professed to save any common law liability that manufacturers had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.601" offset="9087413">Compliance with this act was not to remove any common law liability, and the legislative history that accompanies that confirms what it says.</text>

            <text syncTime="2269.055" offset="9217294">First, this... the tort lawsuit is not a safety standard within the meaning of the preemption clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.409" offset="9238714">That's confirmed by the savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.761" offset="9252089">That is, with the benefit of the savings clause, we know that's not what they meant by a safety standard, a tort judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.849" offset="9276435">But beyond that, we do have the savings clause itself which was put in there, and this is not like the Morales case, or the American Airlines case, where you were dealing with a statute that had had a savings clause way back when, when regulating airlines was the vogue, and Congress said, not only are we going to regulate it, but we want not to interfere with any State regulation of airlines, but then 20 years later, Congress came along and said, now we want to deregulate the airlines, and so we want to make it quite clear, we are now going to preempt State regulation, and those unhappy with that reached back to that earlier savings clause, which was not focused specifically on common law lawsuits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2742.398" offset="11110649">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.141" offset="11161640">On the implied preemption point, the Department of Transportation, the NHTSA, perceives no conflict between its own lack of regulation of antilock brakes, and the Georgia tort law that is relied on by respondents, and NHTSA does not construe its own Federal safety standards either in this case or generally as conferring this federally protected immunity from State tort judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.571" offset="11251292">On the express preemption case, NHTSA believes that, first, Congress did not intend the preemption clause of the saving act... of the Safety Act to reach tort liability and, second, that even if tort suits are covered, that Georgia law would not be preempted in this case because the law would not relate to an aspect of performance of the standard, covered by a standard that is in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.020" offset="11345124">Section 1397(k) makes clear that Congress did not intend the Safety Act's preemption clause to reach common law liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.542" offset="11379188">Congress enacted that saving clause specifically to preclude the argument that compliance with Federal standards would provide a defense as a matter of Federal law to State common law liability, but that is essentially what the petitioners are asking for here, albeit in the guise of preemption, and Congress did draw a distinction between the State-imposed prescriptive standards, which were preempted, and the State-imposed tort liability, which was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.526" offset="11491201">That is the best explanation for the enactment of the saving clause, and really, petitioners have offered no alternative explanation for why Congress would have enacted it, or any alternative interpretation of the saving clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.285" offset="11546162">There is also what we conceive to be the narrower ground for why Georgia tort law would not be preempted in this case expressly, and that is, even the preemption clause applies only when there's a Federal standard in effect and when the State standard governs by the same aspect of performance that is regulated by that Federal standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.385" offset="11634561">NHTSA does not have, in effect, any safety standard that either requires or prohibits the installation of antilock brakes in trucks, and it also does not have in effect any Federal standard that does the same thing indirectly, as was originally conceived, such as by regulating stopping distances or vehicle stability requirements in trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.416" offset="11734662">The petitioners' argument, which is essentially that what NHTSA has left unregulated is a form of regulation, is really quite inconsistent with the way that NHTSA perceives its role under the Safety Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.176" offset="11789728">NHTSA's function under the Safety Act is to set minimum standards of performance, and generally speaking the regulatory scheme does not provide that anything that is not regulated is regulated, that there is this federally protected option to avoid further State regulation or State liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.987" offset="11869036">In this particular case, in the area of antilock brakes, this is simply an area that, as of now, NHTSA has left unregulated, and until it does step in, the States are free to fill that regulatory gap either by prescriptive standards or by an enactment of State... or by the implementation of State tort liability, which is what the respondents are asking for here.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="3370.056" offset="13621225">Mr. Chief Justice, it is entirely correct that we sort certiorari in this Court on the Eleventh Circuit's rule about implied preemption and that was the only matter as to which there was a conflict between the circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.587" offset="13715370">Now, the brief in opposition raises the 26 simply by a casual... or I... drop the casual, simply by the statement that since the Federal regulations did not forbid antilock devices, there can be no conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.904" offset="13824667">Of course, that's not our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.356" offset="13834489">It was not the position of the dissenting judge, it was not the position of the court of appeals, which found there was a conflict, or the district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.796" offset="13872210">Nevertheless, this is not a case like the one you handed down yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.116" offset="13893525">This is not one governed by your Rule 14.1, which deals with the cert position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.204" offset="13921842">It's 15.1 and, of course, the Court is entirely free to proceed to the no-conflict point if it chooses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.060" offset="13961339">Now, it's important to see that the courts, the three courts below did decide this in terms of implied preemption, and did indeed find a conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.819" offset="14020376">The implied preemption perhaps has some more force to it than the express preemption, because the conflict is with what we insist is a total Federal determination, and that is how this Court had looked at the Ilsa Petroleum case although reaching a difference conclusion, but by language, which supports us and the Atlantic Richfield case, which we cite in our brief, as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.873" offset="14148585">Finally, I should point out that it's not quite accurate to say that NHTSA has said we're not ready yet, not quite yet, but everybody has these.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.735" offset="14212010">In these... these trucks were manufactured in '82 and '87.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.787" offset="14232177">They only began to be offered as... antilock devices only began to be offered as options after the later truck was manufactured, and presumably because the manufacturers did not believe they could comply until then with 5.5.1, and what's important to see is that NHTSA has continuously, at the highest levels, sought to impose this requirement and continuously been compelled by its own technical people in reports which we cite to you to say that the evidence shows that the problems have not yet been solved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.899" offset="14404690">If there are no further questions I thank the Court.</text>
