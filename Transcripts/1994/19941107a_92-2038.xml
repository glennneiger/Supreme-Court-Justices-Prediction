            <text syncTime="2048.821" offset="8341799">We think that because Congress actually gave attention in the proviso itself to the information that purchasing farmers should have regarding the variety, if it had intended purchasing farmers to have the further information that this seed is a protected variety, it would have spoken to that in the proviso itself.</text>
