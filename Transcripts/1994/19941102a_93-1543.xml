            <text syncTime="11.189" offset="193101">Mr. Terry.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael E. Terry</label>
            <text syncTime="18.878" offset="223821">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="21.746" offset="235315">Our case is about age discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.281" offset="245450">Particularly, this case is about the after-acquired information doctrine, or the after-acquired evidence doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.102" offset="272722">The so-called after-acquired information in these cases varies, but it bears two common characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.756" offset="303337">First, the information is acquired after a questioned employment practice, usually after litigation has begun.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.795" offset="339491">Second, the employer contends that the information would be a legitimate basis for terminating the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.852" offset="379719">Simply stated, the issue in this case is, what significance should attach to such after-acquired evidence in cases, in discrimination cases arising under the Federal civil rights statutes?</text>
            <text syncTime="72.612" offset="438756">Clearly, there are two camps.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.212" offset="449205">The Sixth Circuit and other courts have determined that such after-acquired evidence is a complete defense to liability and bars all relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.502" offset="494345">The Third Circuit and other courts have determined that after-acquired evidence is not a defense to liability but may, in appropriate cases, impact upon relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.762" offset="555367">We come to this Court with the notion that the after-acquired evidence doctrine is nothing new.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.915" offset="583997">We believe that for more than 30 years this Court's construing the decisions of this Court and agencies construing other Federal statutes have been confronted with the after-acquired defense by employers seeking to avoid liability under other statutes protecting employees' rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.947" offset="672082">In each case, beginning with Still v. Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad in 1961, this Court and the other courts and the agencies have found that after-acquired evidence, as a defense, does not bar all remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="146.291" offset="733522">Well, Still was somewhat different than the present case, wasn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="150.575" offset="750658">Wasn't that the question of whether the person was an employee for purposes of the FELA, even though he might have had misinformation on his application form?</text>

            <text syncTime="161.066" offset="792559">Mr. Chief Justice, Still was under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, and it was a case involving an employee seeing compensation for a back injury, and there was a question about information that he had provided in his form, but he railroad in Still took the position that he was not an employee, not qualified to be an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.332" offset="885659">The respondent in this case takes that position, and so do some of the courts that extend the--</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael E. Terry</label>
            <text syncTime="195.021" offset="928395">--No, but the plaintiff in Still had worked for Norfolk and Western Railroad for 6 years, just like the plaintiff here had worked for the Nashville Banner for 40 years, so the theory that somehow the misconduct or the application error or misstatement has removed the standing or the qualification was the same.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="218.569" offset="1022645">Well, what remedies, Mr. Terry, do you say are available to the petitioner if it is discovered during the course of the discovery proceedings that valid cause existed for the employer to fire the petitioner?</text>

            <text syncTime="238.217" offset="1101221">Justice O'Connor, the first... in answering your question, and maybe you have already suggested that we think the first and very important part of this rule that we propose is that the employer show under a standard similar to the standard in Price Waterhouse that they would have terminated the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.082" offset="1196621">They must show this by objective evidence in a fair, factfinding proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.152" offset="1224937">If that is done, we believe that the remedies should be fashioned by the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.406" offset="1253986">Clearly, if the employer would have terminated the employee, then in most cases reinstatement and front pay are inappropriate, but we do not believe that backpay should be barred, and we believe that their backpay should be awarded in most cases, and awarded to the point of judgment to satisfy the... to satisfy the objectives of the ADEA and title VII.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="302.621" offset="1358789">What about the situation of an employer discovering that there was a fraudulent employment application, that a qualification for the job, for example, was a certain education degree, and the employee had fraudulently said she had that degree, and it's later discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.153" offset="1448963">Now, what kind of relief there, do you suppose?</text>

            <text syncTime="328.339" offset="1461711">We... the answer to your question is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.576" offset="1478639">We propose that that employee should receive backpay if they can... if they can establish a discrimination claim, but the fear in that result, and the problem with that result, is removed by the idea that the employer should be able to pursue State civil and criminal remedies to recover any unjust compensation or any injury that the employer has suffered, so in these extreme cases, when we talk about the so-called nondoctor doctor, or the case where the day-care worker is a child molester, that type of case that are used as examples, the case, the facts of the case take care of themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="390.579" offset="1710606">Would that come into the very same case, the discrimination case, by way of counterclaim?</text>

            <text syncTime="1312.685" offset="5399096">On the issue of liability, I wanted to make two basic points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.970" offset="5412157">First, with a few exceptions that are not applicable here, the language of the statute broadly prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of age against any individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.961" offset="5456147">There is no exception in the statute that would license an employer to discriminate on the basis of age against an employee who is engaged in this conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.067" offset="5496585">Second, as this Court's decisions have made clear, the critical question in determining the issue of liability under the statute, is what actually motivated the employer at the time of the adverse action, and that point is crucial here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.092" offset="5560741">Since this case arises on summary judgment, it must be assumed that at the time the respondent discharged petitioner, it acted entirely on the basis of her age.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.484" offset="5606299">Under the plain language of the statute, that was sufficient to establish a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.786" offset="5623435">After-acquired evidence of petitioner's misconduct could not change the historical fact that by then there had already been a violation of the act, so the only remaining question is what the appropriate remedy is for that violation, and that's governed by 29 U.S.C. section 626, which authorizes district courts to grant such legal and equitable relief as may be appropriate to effectuate the purposes of the act.</text>
