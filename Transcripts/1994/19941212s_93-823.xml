            <text syncTime="10.047" offset="126998">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Nebraska, it’s another tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.117" offset="159285">Respondent a Nebraska resident owns shares in mutual funds that earn some of their income by engaging in financial transactions called repurchase agreements or repos for short.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.658" offset="213411">In a typical repo transaction one who holds federal debt securities whom we would refer to as Seller-Borrower, transfers these securities to the funds and exchange the funds then pays the seller-borrower specified amount of cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.997" offset="282792">At a later date the funds transfer the securities back to Seller-Borrower returns the cash to the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.422" offset="312467">At that time the seller-borrower pays the funds interest at an agreed upon rate that there is no relation to the yield on a security underline the repo.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.461" offset="352696">This interest is in turn distributed to respondent in proportion to his share of the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.041" offset="382998">Petitioner the Nebraska Department of Revenue determined that respondent had to pay Nebraska income tax on interest, income derived from repos involving federal securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.598" offset="429183">Respondent challenge this ruling in the Nebraska Courts, he argue that taxing such income violated the constitution and a federal statute that prohibits states from tax and interest on federal securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.278" offset="487906">The Trial Court agreed with respondent and Nebraska Supreme Court affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.387" offset="508386">In an opinion filed with the clerk today we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.764" offset="521865">We hold that Nebraska taxation of interest income derives from the repos, does not violate the federal statute or the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.204" offset="559690">For purposes of statute the interest earned by the funds is interest on loans from the funds to the Seller- Borrower, not the interest on the federal securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.009" offset="598874">In the repo context the securities operate as collateral for the loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.444" offset="620608">Numerous speeches of the repos are described in detail in our opinion, lead to this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.519" offset="648925">The funds and Seller-Borrower characterized these repos as sales and later repurchases, but we reject respondent’s arguments that these labels preclude us from viewing the repos as loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.739" offset="705767">In tax cases it is a substance and economic realties over transaction account.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.807" offset="726038">The substance and economic realities of the repos here show that the funds are receiving interest on cash that they have loan to the Seller-Borrower.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.260" offset="767834">The opinion of the court is unanimous.</text>
