Reno, when you've got one criterion, bizarreness, and that's not hard to apply, but to determine predominant, substantial, and it can spread to other groups, national origin groups that have been classified as suspect, it seems you're getting... you're opening the door to the kinds of challenges that the Federal courts were into of necessity in the school segregation cases and to a limited extent in the redistricting cases.</text>
