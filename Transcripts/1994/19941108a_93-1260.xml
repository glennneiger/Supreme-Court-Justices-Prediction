            <label>Mr. Drew S. Days, III</label>
            <text syncTime="28.000" offset="251758">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="32.368" offset="269312">In this case, the court of appeals has taken the extraordinary step of invalidating an act of Congress as being beyond its power under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.141" offset="308391">The act in question, known as the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, makes it unlawful for any individual knowingly to possess a firearm within a distance of 1,000 feet from the grounds of an elementary or secondary school.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.233" offset="368682">The court of appeals held the statute unconstitutional because neither the statute nor its legislative history contained express congressional findings identifying the nexus between interstate commerce and gun possession in schoolyards.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.362" offset="433256">The court of appeals reached its erroneous result, in our estimation, through a fundamental misreading and misapplication of the precedents of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.337" offset="481113">First, the court imposed on Congress a requirement that it make judicial... make legislative findings as to the nexus between the activity it was regulating here and interstate commerce to satisfy the court that it was exercising that power in a constitutional manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.564" offset="558017">In doing so, the court of appeals essentially treated Congress as though it was subject to procedural rules that would be appropriate in the context of a judicial or administrative proceeding, but not where Congress was legislating for the entire Nation pursuant to its plenary powers under the Constitution.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="121.093" offset="624159">Well, if we were concerned that the original understandings and structural theories that underlay the Federal system have been so eroded that that whole system is in danger, I take it that it would be appropriate for us to consider some procedural guarantees.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="drew_s_days_iii" startTime="142.923" stopTime="215.554">
            <label>Mr. Drew S. Days, III</label>
            <text syncTime="142.923" offset="711513">Yes, and this Court has considered and imposed certain procedural guarantees where, for example, it felt that Congress was legislating in a way that encroached upon the operations of State governments, as in the case of New York v. United States, where this Court held that Congress could not legislate to the extent it did to require that the States take title to certain nuclear waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.744" offset="838781">It's done so under what has been referred to in the court of appeals decision as the clear statement rule, or the plain statement rule, that where there are incursions upon Government operations, that Congress has to make its intent to exercise its authority to the fullest extent clear in the legislation, and there cannot be any ambiguity in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.962" offset="939614">But what this Court has been doing is looking at, as it properly should, limitations on the exercise of the Commerce Clause found within the Constitution itself, and not based upon some generalized concern that Congress was going too far in carrying out that responsibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="348.791" offset="1534997">I don't know whether there's been a conscious effort to do that, but I think as this Court has said in its Tenth Amendment jurisprudence that Congress reflects the will of the people, and it has built into it, and into its operations, a concern about the extent to which its regulations and its legislation would encroach on matters that have been traditionally left to the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="382.029" offset="1667908">But as I read our cases, the ones that are most often cited, indeed, I think all of them, involve the issue of whether some commercial activity of some sort... renting a hotel room, growing a commodity that is used in commerce... whether some commercial activity is interstate commerce or not, and one can say we're prepared to be very broadminded about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.697" offset="1774592">If Congress says some commercial activity is interstate commerce, or affects interstate commerce, that's okay.</text>
