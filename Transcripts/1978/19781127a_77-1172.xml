            <text syncTime="15.300" offset="164551">The question for decision here is whether or not an association of franchisees of a specific franchisor loses the exemption under Section 501 (c) (6) of the Internal Revenue Code as a business league, even though it might and does otherwise qualify solely by reason of the fact that it does consists of all franchisees of a particular franchisor in this case, Midas Muffler franchisees.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.356" offset="316792">I should like to begin the argument by describing very briefly this association, petitioner in this case and I think its best described in the words of Chief Judge Kaufman of the Second Circuit, who pointed out that it was organized at a time when an internal struggle was taking place within the parent company.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.126" offset="415848">The franchisor and many of Midas' franchisees were concerned that they might suffer from pending corporate shake up.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.800" offset="450539">As a consequence of this they formed the association to secure themselves against the whims of a new Midas management.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.880" offset="486902">Judge Kaufman goes on to say in the later portion of his opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="123.325" offset="596720">Exactly, its similar to that and we make the argument in our papers, that there is a great similarity between a union and in this case while not a union, nevertheless a group of business man, if you well getting together to bargain collectively with their franchisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.765" offset="674461">And that there are many similarities between the union analogy and the franchisee association analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.353" offset="708733">In any event, Judge Kaufman goes on to say that the association has been formidable force at the negotiating table, which follows through exactly as to the analogy between the union and an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.483" offset="785324">So that the genesis of this trade association or business league was protective and defensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.968" offset="819284">It's not a profit making organization.</text>

I have no knowledge of that but in any event the only reason now that we’ve been denied the exemption is the claim that a business league must be similar to a Chamber of Commerce or a Board of Trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.086" offset="2251734">We contend that that position is not warranted by either the Legislative history, the Judicial history or in fact by the way the Internal Revenues Service has itself treated business leagues and other trade associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.489" offset="2329370">Actually in the regulation, which has been in effect for many, many years, the first sentence with some modifications has been in effect for many, many years, says that business league is an association of persons having some common business interest, the purpose of which is to promote such common interest and not to engage in regular business of a kind ordinarily carried on for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.503" offset="2437413">We submit that that sentence properly states the intent of Congress and does define what a business league is?</text>
            <text syncTime="594.277" offset="2480462">Now peculiarly enough in 1929, there was something added to the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.972" offset="2507212">In 1929 for the first time we find the second and third sentences indicating that the business league is supposed to be an organization of the same general classes of Chamber of Commerce or Board of Trade and thus its activity should be the directed the improvement of business conditions of one or more lines of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.523" offset="2593416">However, before 1929 that was not the rule and we have handed up to Your Honors something that I apologize for having found late, but nevertheless is of great importance I think and that is that before the 1929 Amendment, there was a specific sentence the second sentence of the regulation its work meaning business league's work need not be similar to that of a Chamber of Commerce or Board of Trade.</text>

            <text syncTime="766.285" offset="3168528">We look and see, what was reason for the change and the only the reason that we have been able to determine for the -- only reason for the change in 1929 was the statement, which appears in the government's brief that it came about as a result of a case of the Board of Tax Appeals in 1928.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.696" offset="3278137">There is no other legislative history that we can find on that and the fact is that if that were the case, there is nothing in that case, which in anyway justifies the change and this 180 degree turn in the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.150" offset="3359953">Before I get to that however, I would like to point out that the statute, I don’t think needs the application of Latin Maxims such as noscitur a sociis is when used several times in the past. In order to determine exactly what a business league means.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.688" offset="3454098">In other words, if the statute had said that there are should be an exemption for a Chamber of Commerce or a Board of Trade or other business league then it might very well be said that the Congress had in mind that other business league might have in same general characteristics as a Chamber of Commerce or a Board of Trade, but we don’t find that.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.078" offset="3539675">We find these under disjunctive business leagues separately, Chamber of Commerce separately and Board of Trade separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.211" offset="3572172">So that there is nothing that I can see in the statute itself, which warrants any constriction that says, that the business league must be similar and have similar characteristics to a Chamber of Commerce to Board of Trade and as I pointed out before in fact the Internal Revenue Service took the opposite position up until 1929.</text>

            <text syncTime="895.781" offset="3686484">I have tried to determine the reason for the inclusion of football leagues in 1966 Amendment and I have been told on one hand as an congressional aberration, which may very well be and on the other hand that nobody really knows the reasons, they were always exempt, but there was just put into make sure that they exemption was granted to them, but the fact of the matter is as Your Honor has pointed out that if we are going into these characteristics and have the same general characteristics and even if we assume that a Real-estate board, which was added in 1928 has the same general characteristics then Your Honor is quite right.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.676" offset="3830053">I see, no justification for categorizing a football league and putting him in same categories at Chamber of Commerce or Board of Trade and its strikes us that this evidences an intention of Congress not to make them similar and never was intended to be similar.</text>

            <text syncTime="1031.173" offset="4228054">I would think that that's hardly a substitute for some language by any of legislators or some language in any committee report, which indicated that was the intent of Congress and I think its reaching pretty far to take self-serving declarations of the United States Chamber of Commerce and say that the constitutes a manner of precedent for determining that that was the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.239" offset="4356368">The congressional intent may be determined by people who plead before Congress for a specific exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.749" offset="4398373">Now there was no question about the fact that if we are correct and that the business league is properly defined in the first sentence of the regulation that the appellant in this case meets every phase of that intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.732" offset="4498265">It fits the first sentence of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.879" offset="4558869">It strikes us therefore that the language of the statute, the regulation as it existed prior to 1929, the first sentence of the regulation, the lack of any other judicial precedent accept of course any decision of the Seventh Circuit, which was contrary to that of the Second circuit and that’s why we here I guess, that by definition petitioner is entitled to the exemption as a matter again of simple statutory construction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3625.477" offset="14605249">No, I would only add one thing if Your Honors please and that is that there is no basis whatsoever for the argument made by Mr. Smith that this organization was formed to enhance the Midas program in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.983" offset="14659271">Mr. Justice Stevens is quite right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.676" offset="14666062">The organization was formed as a protective, and a defensive measure only and there is no other justification for its existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.450" offset="14697200">That it may from time to time help and work together with Midas is something that a union does from time to time, with an employer working together to enhance the position of both.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.994" offset="14739310">But in the ultimate and the general position is entirely that it has been formed an act as a defensive measure and as I point merely for bargaining, collective bargaining, if you will, with the franchisor.</text>
