            <text syncTime="23.742" offset="198301">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.523" offset="225468">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.968" offset="235290">I am Mark Alan Hart, Deputy Attorney General of the State of California, appearing as counsel for petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.508" offset="265383">Miranda versus Arizona opened a new chapter in the law of confessions, a chapter that began with precise rules to guide law enforcement in the conducting of a custodial interrogation but has over the years been read with some different and expanded interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.070" offset="331630">In the case at bar, the California Supreme Court has applied the strict Miranda rules with one addition, that a juvenile who requests his probation officer per se invokes his Fifth Amendment right to be silent, no less than if he asks for an attorney, and that his statements must be suppressed without regard to whether or not they were in fact involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.401" offset="416998">The operative facts are brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.559" offset="425566">On the evening of January 19, 1976, Robert and Helen Yeager were on their way to their home in the San Fernando Valley section of Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.518" offset="461406">Unbeknownst to them, respondent and two of his friends were following in a pickup truck being driven by respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.916" offset="487006">They were looking for someone to rob.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.430" offset="497142">They were looking for money and they had a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.460" offset="509262">The Yeager's arrived home.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.476" offset="517308">Respondent and his friends approached the house, approached Mr. Yeager and during the course of an attempted robbery, one of the other minors shot Mr. Yeager and killed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.367" offset="564851">Respondent was apprehended and brought into the police station for questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.568" offset="577599">He was 16 years old at the time of the offense and he had had prior experience with the juvenile court system including serving some time in a youth camp.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.071" offset="615633">He was given the standard Miranda admonition.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.263" offset="624410">He was told that he had a right to remain silent, was told that anything he said could and would be used against him in a court of law, that he had a right to an attorney, that if he could not afford one, one would be appointed for him at -- without his expense and that he had a right to have the attorney present during all stages of interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.711" offset="694209">He was asked if he understood his rights and if he wanted to talk to the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.044" offset="711555">He indicated that he did and that he might talk but when asked if he would give up his right to an attorney present, he responded, “Can I have my probation officer here?”</text>
            <text syncTime="162.516" offset="753455">To this, the officers replied, “Well, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.628" offset="761919">We can't call your probation officer right now, but you have a right to an attorney.”</text>
            <text syncTime="170.266" offset="784488">And, respondent's response was, “Well, how do I know you guys won't -- pull no police officer in and then tell me he's an attorney?”</text>
            <text syncTime="176.876" offset="810924">And, to this, respondent was re-admonished as to the standard Miranda rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.897" offset="826911">He was told, “You can have an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.792" offset="838510">You don't have to talk to us at all if you don't want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.175" offset="848123">If you want to talk to us without an attorney present, you can talk to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.239" offset="860348">If you don't want to, you don't have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.884" offset="870902">That's your right.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.122" offset="875813">Do you understand that right?”</text>
            <text syncTime="195.189" offset="884172">Respondent indicated that he did understand that right and, when asked if he would talk to him without -- talk to them without an attorney present, respondent replied, “Yeah, I want to talk to you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="207.150" offset="931924">Later during the interview, respondent confessed to having participated in the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.936" offset="951150">Juvenile court proceedings were instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.293" offset="960554">Respondent's confession was admitted into evidence and several other things were established during the proceedings, including the fact that respondent had been on probation that his probation officer had counseled him as to some family problems, but that the probation officer under California law was a peace officer and that respondent was told this.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.018" offset="1039444">The trial court made a finding of voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.767" offset="1050415">Respondent was declared a ward of the court for having committed a murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.564" offset="1069641">In reversing the judgment, the California Supreme Court has taken the Miranda exclusionary rule and applied the language dealing with request for legal counsel one step further.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.935" offset="1111124">They've applied it to probation officers, by statute peace officers, in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.045" offset="1135574">It is positioner-- petitioner's position, the instant confession was obtained after a fully informed waiver of Fifth Amendment rights, including the right to legal counsel, that the admonitions -- both admonitions given to respondent in his statements, before and after each, indicate a knowing and intelligent waiver and that the statements were properly admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.356" offset="1224808">Respondent's request to see his probation officer was at most an ambiguity at the waiver stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.487" offset="1253334">And it was clarified by the further admonition in the additional waiver obtained that respondent had a clear desire to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.631" offset="1285935">Petitioner suggests to this Court the following rule or the following approach to this kind of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.311" offset="1312580">That when interrogating officers are faced with an ambiguous response to a Miranda advisement they should be permitted to clarify the statement with further questioning in order to determine whether or not in fact the suspect is expressing an unwillingness to speak or merely making an information or request.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.035" offset="1387499">If upon asking those clarification questions it is clear the suspect is not invoking his Fifth Amendment right as is the case here then police should be com -- permitted to begin an interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.588" offset="1441729">There are several things in the instant case, the petitioner submits.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.073" offset="1455626">Give this Court an indication of the voluntariness of respondent's statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.828" offset="1474644">And that we submit is the only permissible goal under the Fifth Amendment whether the statement was voluntary product not obtained by overriding the suspect's free will and based on an informed waiver of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.851" offset="1526784">Number one, respondent nowhere alleges that it was an uninformed waiver or that he did not understand his right to an attorney or anything about the Miranda rights was unclear to him.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="368.512" offset="1577462">Well, you don't suggest, do you, Mr. Hart, that if there had been no Miranda warning, a finding of voluntariness would save the case under Miranda?</text>

            <text syncTime="379.269" offset="1620407">Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, respectfully, while that issue need not be reached in this case, we would suggest that the Miranda warnings are not necessarily applicable to juvenile proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.072" offset="1667636">This Court has noted and respondent has conceded in his briefs on the merits that this Court has never specifically applied the precise Miranda exclusionary rule to juvenile court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1143.771" offset="4678405">First, under California law, the probation officer would have to advice the minor of his constitutional rights himself as a peace officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.686" offset="4710066">Number two, again referring to Justice Mosk's opinion, he speculates as to just that problem and talks about the Mutt-and-Jeff situation that this Court referred to in Miranda where you have a friendly peace officer and an adversary peace officer working at odds with each other, and he says “the case is going to come to us and surely, when it does, I don't know what we're going to do with it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.795" offset="4798568">Now, with that premise in mind, my guess would be that the California Supreme Court would find that by statute the probation officer is a peace officer and that in that kind of situation the advice the minor receive from the probation officer was not the advice of counsel and did not comply with the requirements of Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.800" offset="4874533">And that it would be just what the Court suggested that it would be a peace officer or the State of California advising the minor to cooperate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1614.887" offset="6562879">Albert Menaster, Public Defender's Office, County of Los Angeles, for the minor, Michael C., respondent in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.653" offset="6597987">I'd like to start out by telling this Court about another youngster, this one named Joseph.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.030" offset="6619512">Joseph said, “I want to be an adult.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.062" offset="6627662">Treat me like an adult.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.288" offset="6636544">Use the Miranda rules that apply to adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.957" offset="6647202">Use every rule that applies to adults, please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.219" offset="6660263">In every way I want to be an adult.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.402" offset="6668936">I don't want to be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.968" offset="6675205">I don't want things done on my behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.897" offset="6682937">I want to be treated just like an adult.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.254" offset="6692342">And Joseph prosecuted his case through every layer of court and one day reached this Court and this Court decided Joseph's case by saying, “You don't get to be an adult, Joseph.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.661" offset="6734033">You don't get your jury trial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.279" offset="6740511">And the case was McKeiver versus Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.397" offset="6752946">This Court said in McKeiver that there was something different about juveniles, something that is not the same as to an adult.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.964" offset="6787218">And that difference justified denying Joseph a right every adult in this country has and that's the right to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.756" offset="6822431">Michael comes to this Court any -- and on his behalf I read briefs by the petitioner and I have trouble with those briefs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2447.272" offset="9892446">And, I think that the rules of the system in California drawing a line at 18 between juveniles and adult is a recognition that with majority comes maturity and certain requirements are -- we assume are going to be applicable to a person who's an adult.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.454" offset="9949184">To a person who's a juvenile, it is unrealistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.883" offset="9958902">As the Supreme Court of California said in Burton, it is unrealistic to expect that a youngster is going to ask for an attorney and be able to get one.</text>

            <text syncTime="2491.730" offset="10070288">The California Supreme Court expressly relied on the California statute, Welfare and Institutions Code Section 280, which says that the minor -- that the probation officer is required to act in the interests of the minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.638" offset="10137893">That's statutory duty, that is mandated by a California Code Section, was construed by the court in California as the reason why a request for a probation officer in this case invoked Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.914" offset="10195048">And I want to disagree with something else the petitioner has said.</text>

            <text syncTime="2536.538" offset="10249488">It is clear from the California Supreme Court's language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.272" offset="10264430">They were saying, “Michael's request in California for a probation officer in this case, remember the background, the probation officer advising the minor to call him so he could advice him of his rights and help him understand the rights, obviously help him ensure the trustworthiness to make sure that an attorney was reliable and not a sham artist, that was what the California Supreme Court relied on.</text>

            <text syncTime="2937.831" offset="11854660">If a youngster shows in a way that a youngster would that that youngster wants help in understanding his rights, then that's an invocation of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.884" offset="11898859">It's not fair to juveniles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.632" offset="11905860">It misses the point of McKeiver to say that the youngster can only assert his rights by using an adult formulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.442" offset="11933132">The reality is that youngsters are young persons, and young persons ask for things in a different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.758" offset="11962389">It would be like making up a special word, a long word that had to be said and youngsters couldn't say the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.057" offset="11983600">Youngster could -- knows that he has a right to an attorney, but he also knows that he can't hire an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.232" offset="12000319">That's what he has to have a parent or probation officer for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.885" offset="12010872">He knows that if they bring an attorney, he's never heard of him, he doesn't know whether he's going to be tricked or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.968" offset="12031248">In fact the police are threatening this minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.663" offset="12038040">I think it's quite clear that Michael was terrified of the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.409" offset="12049011">He wants somebody to give him a guarantee that that attorney is on the up and up, and that's why he's asking for his probation officer in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.840" offset="12078686">I'd like to turn to another point, which I think has not been stressed nearly sufficiently in this case and that is that beyond the technical Miranda issue in this case there is a further issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.929" offset="12127065">An issue not referred to at all in petitioner's opening argument and that is that independent of the Miranda grounds there is a second issue here concerning the voluntariness of the confession apart from the request for the probation officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.619" offset="12185893">Michael repeatedly is asked, in fact he's asked within half a page of this supposed waiver, “Do you want to tell us about the murder?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.196" offset="12216195">Answer, “No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.705" offset="12226226">Petitioner says that's ambiguous, I've been figuring -- trying to figure out how that could possibly be ambiguous and I still can't figure it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.945" offset="12255169">Perhaps petitioner will tell us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.688" offset="12262170">Three or four pages later, he's asked, “Do you want to tell us what happened?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.910" offset="12271052">He says, “No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.178" offset="12276067">Three to four pages after that, they said, “Do you want to tell us what happened?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.203" offset="12284217">He says, “Can't.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.831" offset="12290696">Finally, after 10 pages of exchange in which Michael makes no admission, no confession of any kind, it wouldn't be usable worth a wit in any proceeding before he makes any kind of statement, the police finally say, “Okay, that's it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.148" offset="12340015">Somebody is going to come out of this pretty good and the one who tells us what happen is the one who's not going to get hassled.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.478" offset="12361331">Michael then -- there's been a pause in the recording and, during that pause described by both trial counsel and the trial court, that's characterized as crying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.446" offset="12405112">So, Michael's threatened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.468" offset="12413262">He cries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.124" offset="12415875">He breaks down and then he immediately makes the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.310" offset="12424652">That's the form -- forms the basis for this confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.741" offset="12438340">Now, I find it hard to believe that that's not an involuntary statement forgetting Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.812" offset="12454640">Just on the standard voluntariness totality of circumstances test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.440" offset="12473135">It seems to me, the petitioner has not dealt with that problem and that petitioner needs to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.044" offset="12495600">Let me go back then to the critical issue that I think applies to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.488" offset="12513364">This Court has to decide whether juveniles are going to be treated like juveniles when it comes to jury trials perhaps bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.664" offset="12546069">But, when it comes to Miranda, we're going to make juveniles be adults and use adult words in order to invoke a right when they clearly are terrified, they're being threatened, they're asking for help.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.678" offset="12598105">I find it amazing, amazing that petitioner characterizes this as simply an informational inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.086" offset="12627675">I suppose Michael -- the theories that Michael would like to come before this Court and go to the police station and say, “Well, I have an academic question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.750" offset="12658395">I'm writing kind of a thesis on constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.348" offset="12668740">Could you just tell me what you think the Supreme Court will decide and whether I have the right to a probation officer or not?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.542" offset="12689533">I think that that's an incredible reading of this record, unbelievable reading of this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.024" offset="12711476">And I think that a fair reading of this record is that Michael wanted help because he wanted to make sure he wasn't going to be tricked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.133" offset="12743868">In fact, he got tricked I contend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.262" offset="12752436">The point is that Michael ought to be treated as a juvenile because he was a juvenile at the time of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.719" offset="12790262">He was treated as a juvenile and it is artificial and unrealistic to expect that only a request in adult terms is sufficient to satisfy what Miranda was talking about when it was talking about protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.095" offset="12843760">Incidentally, I would like to disagree with petitioner on one further point and that is I think Miranda applies to juveniles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.491" offset="12869360">We have yet a further extension by petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.655" offset="12882004">Petitioner wants this Court to treat juveniles like juveniles when it comes to jury trials but don't treat them like adults even if they ask for attorneys, a request which would invoke Miranda in any adult case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.117" offset="12923800">It's an incredible position, a position not mentioned in the briefs incidentally and one which I think this Court should summarily reject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.134" offset="12947937">This Court has to decide in this case how to apply Miranda to juveniles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.482" offset="12969253">This is not an extension of Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.965" offset="12979284">It is an application of Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.310" offset="12988583">This Court will choose either to apply Miranda in such a way as to make it artificial and require juveniles to be adults when they're not required anywhere else to be adults where it will recognize the realities of a juvenile situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.585" offset="13045739">And it will conclude that where a juvenile shows that that juvenile wants help, that it is not fair, it is a violation of the Fifth Amendment for the police to continue to interrogate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.286" offset="13096521">I'd like to close with just two thoughts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.556" offset="13105612">First of all, the incredible argument by petitioner that there was an equivocal waiver in this case and true, once Michael says, “yes,” sandwiched in between all of these no's and what about being tricked and that sort of thing reminds me of a wizard of a cartoon where the king says to the lawyer, “Your client confessed,” and the lawyer says, “How do I know it was voluntary?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.153" offset="13175933">And the king says, “Because look, there's your client's signature right there underneath the bloodstains.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.341" offset="13196727">It seems to me that in this situation Michael made an equivocal waiver but he did everything else he could possible think of to say he didn't want to waive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.703" offset="13230164">He showed fear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.813" offset="13234657">He showed anxiety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.940" offset="13239150">He asserted his rights under the old involuntariness test, I submit, that Michael clearly asserted his rights sufficiently to invoke the Fifth Amendment, apart from any Miranda consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.129" offset="13275930">I think that the bottom line of this case is that petitioner in this case is arguing that because of the technical nature of Miranda we have to be very cautious in analyzing what kinds of things we're going to technically invoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.103" offset="13327757">It reminds me of a quotation from Justice Wisdom who said that if police efficiency were the only important thing then the rack would be alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.080" offset="13359731">There are things more important than police efficiency, and they happen to be listed in the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.180" offset="13388048">I charge this Court with deciding whether juveniles are juveniles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.551" offset="13405602">Whether Miranda applies to juveniles and recognizes the reality of juveniles or whether this Court will hide its head in the sand, pretend juveniles are adults, deny them rights when that argument is made, but deny them rights when they assert what are juvenile rights in the same context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.163" offset="13467982">And I would ask the Court to carefully consider the decision in this case for the impact it will have on probation systems on juvenile systems throughout this nation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3378.846" offset="13618761">We submit that this approach of attempting to determine or predict the subjective intent of any minor who asks for his probation officer takes away the traditional role of the trier of fact to determine if in a given instance a minor is making a voluntary statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.768" offset="13698487">The critical factor in Miranda was whether a suspect wanted to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.820" offset="13722624">This Court found that a request for an attorney is reasonably an indication that a suspect doesn't want to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.687" offset="13750105">There is no basis for the same reasonable per -- the same conclusion and the same per se rule with respect to probation officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.438" offset="13789080">This Court noted that in, In re Gault when the State of Arizona attempted to argue that they didn't have to provide the minor with counsel because the probation officer could provide him all of the services of the attorney and this Court rejected that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.141" offset="13835891">Noted that probation officers in the Arizona scheme were also peace officers and that they initiate proceedings involving the minor and they could not provide the same assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.248" offset="13876328">If a probation officer cannot fulfill the traditional goals of legal counsel then a rule which said any minor per se invokes his Fifth Amendment right by asking for his probation officer bears no relation to the goals of the Miranda Court and bears no relation to the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.198" offset="13956159">I'd like to talk just briefly about the other contention of respondent that indications in the record, apart from the request of the probation officer, indicate that the minor was invoking his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.496" offset="14001403">Respondent isolates all of those statements from the context of the record, and I think we've discussed it pretty well in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.369" offset="14028884">For example, the first one that respondent mentioned where he was asked about the murder and he says, “No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.449" offset="14049155">What he said was, “No, I don't know anything about it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.763" offset="14062425">Now, it seems to me that in the course of any interrogation or any conversation there are going to be times when there's a hesitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.030" offset="14091473">There are going to be times when a suspect may deny participation in an offense but each one of those is not a separate invocation of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.309" offset="14128567">It's something for the trier of fact to look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.816" offset="14138598">The trier of fact in this case and the California Court of Appeals and the California Supreme Court, all found that none of those were indications of the Fifth Amendment invocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.677" offset="14178095">The sole issue in this case is whether the request for the probation officer was such an invocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.539" offset="14197530">We submit that it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.360" offset="14204844">We submit that the standard with respect to juveniles should be voluntariness based on the totality of the circumstances, a standard employed by the trial court in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.738" offset="14246327">And we would submit the matter if there are no more questions from the bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.251" offset="14260328">Thank you.</text>
