            <label>Mr. Mark L. Evans</label>
            <text syncTime="105.299" offset="524518">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.511" offset="537370">These consolidated cases are here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.588" offset="557746">They present a discrete issue of reviewability.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.119" offset="571852">Are the courts empowered to review an ICC decision not to investigate a proposed railroad rate change before the change takes effect?</text>
            <text syncTime="127.087" offset="611767">The Court of Appeals held that such a decision is reviewable and we argued that it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.247" offset="632351">The case started in August 1977 when the Southern Railroads filed tariffs proposing a 20% seasonal increase on the rates for the transportation of grain in the southern territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.223" offset="684283">The tariff was to last for three months and it was among the first of the tariffs filed under the 1976 legislation which directed the Commission to allow the filing of such demand sensitive rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.857" offset="742797">The purpose of the statute was to give shippers an incentive to reduce peak period transportation and to better use the national car pool of railroad freight cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.334" offset="808730">Several groups of shippers including the respondents here filed protest with the Commission arguing that the increase has violated a variety of sections of the Act and they asked the Commission to suspend and investigate the rates under Section 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.952" offset="867140">The Commission decided not to suspend or investigate essentially for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.718" offset="886262">First, it was not convinced that the shippers had made convincing arguments on the merits of their claims of unlawfulness, and second, because the Commission wanted to carry out the congressional policy of creating a regulatory climate that would be conducive to this kind of experimentation in railroad ratemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.345" offset="964733">The shippers filed a petition for review in the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.585" offset="985736">They sought and we got a stay from the court for approximately eight days which enjoined the railroads from collecting the rates during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.533" offset="1021471">The Court of Appeals declined to review the Commission's decision not suspend the rates but it held that it could review the decision not to investigate the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.809" offset="1054595">A decision that is characterized as a termination of an investigation into the lawfulness of the rates, court of appeals reasoned that shippers -- the shippers had made substantial allegations that the tariffs were patently unlawful that the Commission had a duty to investigate and that it's what it referred to as a premature termination of the investigation was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.230" offset="1144247">The decision was in conflict with the decision of the District of Columbia Circuit which had held unreviewable, a commission decision not to investigate under Section 15 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.949" offset="1191163">The key to the case, I believe is in the structure of the acts, rate investigation and complaint procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.737" offset="1218330">There are two ways that the Commission can investigate a railroad rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.300" offset="1236616">Under Section 15, it has the power before the effectiveness of the rate to institute an investigation and during that period to suspend the rate for up to seven or ten months depending on whether it seeks an extension of time pending the completion of the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.726" offset="1306311">If it decides against instituting a Section 15 investigation, anyone can complain under Section 13 and the Commission must investigate in response to their complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="311.923" offset="1351032">Am I right in thinking Mr. Evans that under Section 13 complaint, the Commission doesn't simply set as an adjudicator but it has an affirmative duty to investigate it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_l_evans" startTime="323.217" stopTime="335.343">

            <text syncTime="323.217" offset="1396276">It must investigate, it must begin a proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.412" offset="1409024">It is an effect an adjudicator of the proceeding, basically, a dispute between the complaining party on the one hand and the carrier on the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="335.343" offset="1444760">Well, can it just seat back and say you two contestants bring your evidence before we will decide or does it have to participate in the investigation?</text>

            <text syncTime="346.411" offset="1489063">No, I think it's more the former.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.767" offset="1498467">It does not necessarily actively participate in the investigation by the same token of course has the power to develop the record if the record is not being adequately developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.258" offset="1532426">But investigation is a term that was used in the original act.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.593" offset="1549772">It really, in the recodification, it's been changed to the word proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.330" offset="1564714">It's a proceeding before the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.558" offset="1573595">And it can be instituted either on its motion in which case there may not be complaining party in which case it would developed the record or could be instituted in response to a complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="375.906" offset="1607032">So the investigation is the same under either 13 or 15?</text>

          <turn speaker="mark_l_evans" startTime="380.004" stopTime="467.021">
            <label>Mr. Mark L. Evans</label>
            <text syncTime="380.004" offset="1623437">Essentially the same, there are several procedural differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.962" offset="1651231">The burden of proof with respect to some issues is on the carrier in a Section 15 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.406" offset="1684982">That is the one that would be instituted in advance of the rates effectiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.641" offset="1701909">On the question of whether the rates are reasonable are these, are they high enough or too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.352" offset="1724792">The carrier their bears the burden of going forward with evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.123" offset="1739839">As to other issues, the burden remains the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.631" offset="1749870">In either proceeding, the burden of going forward with an initial showing on question such as discrimination or violations of the long and short whole clause which are the issues that we have in this case rest with the shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.819" offset="1798666">There are some differences in the result of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.377" offset="1812877">In a Section 15 proceeding, the Commission may order refunds if it finds that the rates are unjustified.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.900" offset="1842970">In a Section 13 proceeding, the result is damages in favor of the shipper if he can demonstrate that he's been financially injured by the unlawful rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.821" offset="1882676">And they are slightly different statutory time limits that govern the proceedings under Section 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.784" offset="1906500">The Commission is under an obligation to complete the proceeding in seven months with a possible three-month extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.357" offset="1928756">There's not that same statutory limit in a Section 13 proceeding but there are some internal some procedural limits within the proceeding itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="467.021" offset="1971493">Mr. Evans, can you help me in one perhaps it's an awfully narrow question but under a Section 15 proceeding, if folks see the word investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.643" offset="2001899">Does the word investigate refer to what the Commission should do before it decides whether or not to suspend or does it refer to the examination made after the suspension?</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark L. Evans</label>
            <text syncTime="484.117" offset="2039829">It refers to the examination made after the suspension or after the decision to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.060" offset="2059577">That's critical to this case because the Court of Appeals as I mentioned characterized what the Commission did here as a premature termination of an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.488" offset="2097298">The term investigation is used in the statute, the statutes that we codify the word is now proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.710" offset="2122167">What it means is the process that can lead to a final judgment on the -- or final order of the Commission adjudicating the lawfulness of the rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="909.816" offset="3742595">The same time it stated in that case the corollary principle that the Commission need not institute the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.871" offset="3770807">That matter according to court was a matter committed to the agency's discretion and not reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.855" offset="3794840">The second error, the court made was that it seemed to think that Section 13 complaint procedures under Section 13 would not be available for certain categories of claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="944.192" offset="3880103">And finally, it believed that the decision of the Commission not to investigate was tantamount to a finding that the rates were lawful and that's not the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1148.462" offset="4697213">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.591" offset="4713723">As representative of the railroads, I would like to approach essentially and very emphatically the overriding public policy problems as well as the congressional mandate avoidance problems, if you will that we will face if and I do without completely the position that the Commission has taken in this regard that the court below has simply intruded, it is a classic example of an intrusion into an administrative proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.434" offset="4845066">They absolutely took this case, they entered a suspension as only the Commission has the authority to do under 15 (8) and as this Court has held emphatically, a completely a part from court interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.939" offset="4935137">They then proceeded to take every step available under Section 15 (8) to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.208" offset="4956244">They made a determination in light of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.491" offset="4969305">They issued a refund order and they then proceeded to set an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.493" offset="4997308">They literally remanded to the Commission and said to the Commission you will investigate and you will make findings on two specific areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.931" offset="5047045">In 1976, Congress passed the Railroad revitalization and regulatory reformat and within that as the Commission has indicated were provisions which drastically changed the rate making regulation allowed to the Commission and in most instances definitely decrease the authority that the Commission had to step in especially at pre-effective stage to literally interfere with railroad made rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.281" offset="5192495">Carrier initiation of rates isn't absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.747" offset="5206392">There is only the suspension stage which interferes with carrier initiation of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.755" offset="5234395">One of the provisions was the provision allowing the publication of demand sensitive rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.036" offset="5259473">The allegations which have been made of patent illegalities by the protestants were desperate attempts literally, 11th hour attempts on part of one of the protestants simply to get before a court to avoid the restrictions that have been placed by Congress within 15 (a) including and I address the question which was initially requested of Mr. Evans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.464" offset="5385279">The suspension state is more like a petition for a stay to a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.615" offset="5409834">At this particular time and it was prior to February of 1976 because indeed now a complainant to the Commission requesting that a rate be suspended or investigated or both must show that there is a possibility of substantial harm and that there is a likelihood that the complainant will prevail on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.683" offset="5510144">Neither the complainants represented before this Court today did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.702" offset="5538147">In seeking appeal to the Eighth Circuit, the complainants in essence avoided their recourse through the Commission and mislead the Court in a sense by requesting suspension on patent illegalities when it had not been proved to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.366" offset="5632815">The court below misconstrued what the complainants were saying to the Court and that is where we find ourselves today before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.456" offset="5689240">If the lower court decision is not reversed, it literally will open floodgates to allow shippers to avoid the restrictions that have not been placed against them by Congress by allowing is equivalent to a pre-1910 situation where the courts will be telling the Commission when they will and when then they will not investigate and at what time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.993" offset="5799372">The most compelling example of this is the position represented to this Court today by the Chicago Board of Trade and its co-respondent parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.450" offset="5849213">They have simply alleged simple violations of two sections of the Interstate Commerce Act which deal with discriminatory or prejudicial practices, most definitely, areas with which only the Commission is qualified to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.486" offset="5945344">If the lower court decision is upheld, it will only be necessary for a complainant to go before the Commission and to make any allegation of patent illegality and then put that before in appeals court for the court to decide whether they have raised a substantial question or not, not to allow the Commission to make that determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1519.023" offset="6179506">First, we agree with the Commission that the Court of Appeals do not have jurisdiction to review the Commission's decision in this case essentially because in our view the Commission's decision was not a final decision that is reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act and because the complaining shippers had not exhausted their administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.190" offset="6256097">In that respect, we disagreed with the Court of Appeals and with the complaining shippers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1581.829" offset="6430699">Perhaps not absolutely necessary but in order to determine and to conclude as we submit you should that the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.445" offset="6473122">There are two alternative theories for accepting that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.976" offset="6487228">The first theory is the Commission's theory that this is simply one of those kind of agency actions that is committed to agency discretion by law and therefore under the administrative Procedure Act, wholly immune from judicial review at anytime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.463" offset="6541249">The other position is our position which is quite different which is that it is not one of those kind of actions but rather the Court of Appeals lack jurisdiction on finality principles and failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.068" offset="6595688">Our position is based on our view that under the particular scheme by the Interstate Commerce Act, the principle consequence that a Commission's decision not to conduct an investigation under Section 15 is to shift the burden of proof on the question of the lawfulness of rates from carriers wold be under Section 15 to shippers where it would be under Section 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.964" offset="6691192">That consequence is expressly provided for by in the Act and it's an important aspect of the scheme of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.130" offset="6719927">As this Court has recognized in a number of decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.402" offset="6732988">If the Commission conducts and decides to conduct an investigation under Section 15, that Section expressly provides that the burden of proof is on the carrier to show that the proposed change in rates is just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.656" offset="6781994">If the Commission does not investigate under Section 15, any aggrieved shipper can file a complaint under Section 13 and compel a Commission to adjudicate the lawfulness of the rates but in that case, the burden is on the complaining shipper to show that the rates are unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.353" offset="6848763">I'd like to take briefly our reasons for agreeing with the Commission that the Court of Appeals was wrong in reviewing this case and devote the preponderance of my time to the point in which we disagree with the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.123" offset="6899858">The Commission's decision not to investigate under Section 15 was not reviewable by the Court of Appeals in our view because it was not a final decision within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act and within the meaning of 28 United States Code Section 23425 which gives the Courts of Appeals jurisdiction to review final orders of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.471" offset="6997243">Contrary to the Court of Appeals, the Commission's decision not to investigate under Section 15 did not constitute or expressly or in effect a determination on the lawfulness of the proposed rate changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.889" offset="7050951">The statute gives shippers an adequate remedy in Section 13 to compel the Commission to decide the lawfulness of the rates and the Administrative Procedure Act and principles of exhaustion administrative remedies require shippers to use and employ that procedure before they can invoke judicial review.</text>

            <text syncTime="1880.838" offset="7626689">There are circumstances as I will explain in a minute in which they can be easily imagine and not extremely farfetched in which the Commission's decision not to conduct an investigation would be, we think plainly contrary to the statute or plainly arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.375" offset="7708923">We've given some examples in our brief but for the present, let me outline the precise reasons that we disagree with the Commission's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.464" offset="7761272">As I said, we agree that the Court of Appeals did not have jurisdiction to review in this case now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.540" offset="7781543">But the Commission goes further and contends that its decision not to investigate is never subject to judicial review even after a final decision by the Commission on the merits of the lawfulness of rates because in the Commission's view, the decision not to investigate is one of those actions which under the Administrative Procedure Act is committed to agency discretion by law and therefore wholly unreviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.869" offset="7886869">According to the logic of the Commission's position, therefore it believes that its discretion not to investigate is analogous to the discretion of the public prosecutor not to investigate or prosecute someone for violations of criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.384" offset="7948936">With that proposition, we strongly disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.993" offset="7963355">And I'd like to emphasize two points in connection with our disagreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.068" offset="7983626">The first is that we believe that the Commission's position is contrary to general and important principles that this Court has established determining the availability of judicial review of administrative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.932" offset="8039111">The second point I want to make is that while it may be that there is not, that there will not be a practical difference or that there will be little practical difference between our position and the Commission's position in most cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.653" offset="8093968">There may be some cases in which it is of significant practical consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.645" offset="8118000">And we believe that an example of the kind of case where it may make a difference has already been before this Court in the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway case versus Wichita Board of Trade case in 412 U.S. discussed in our brief at pages 35 to 37?</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.770" offset="8198457">With respect to the first point, this Court has established and stated in many cases that the Administrative Procedure Act establishes a strong presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative action and there are only two circumstances in which review can be precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.588" offset="8265749">First, where a statute expressly precludes review or second, where the statutory scheme provides some particular and persuasive reason why review would not be appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3545.995" offset="14287391">In the first reply, they provided a tariff citation in the specific demonstration that there was not a departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.512" offset="14313409">In the second reply, with all due respect on page 292, there was various mumbo jumbo and legal language to the effect that there might be departures.</text>

            <text syncTime="3564.717" offset="14362206">With respect to the Commission's ability to verify the departures, the Commission's rules provide that that an application should be filed in advance or with the filing of a tariff that contains departures and provides it under normal circumstances, that application should be filed 30 days in advance of the filing of the rate and only after investigation under the statute and finding the special case can such rates such as this be to take effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="3662.978" offset="14755297">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.345" offset="14768776">From the standpoint of my clients the crucial issue in this case simply comes down to whether or not the case is -- the Court is going to decide our case on the basis of the facts and the merits of our case whether it's going to extend the Arrow principle to cover every situation where the Commission allows a rate to become effective regardless of circumstances and regardless of how arbitrary the Commission's action is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.094" offset="14875773">I think it's quite obvious that this case is not like Arrow and that the Arrow rational does not apply to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.964" offset="14903254">The tariffs here are unlawfully discriminatory per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.974" offset="14919241">There is no primary jurisdiction question involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.883" offset="14930944">No question of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.228" offset="14940244">There's no question of injunction pending in investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.989" offset="14955290">We did not ask for the investigation that was the theory of the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.191" offset="14976188">There are no disputed issues of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.440" offset="14989145">The tariff in the case was about four or five pages long in an answer to a question raised earlier by Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.241" offset="15024358">I think it is obvious that the issue could have been decided on the basis of the tariff, the protest and the reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.172" offset="15052048">A straight question of law is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.266" offset="15064482">And on the straight question of law, no ruling by the Commission is necessary and if they had made a ruling it would not be binding on the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.537" offset="15097501">In other words, this is a question of law which has right for a review at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.080" offset="15119653">We say that it is wrong to extend the Arrow principle to cover this type of situation for reasons which I state it is wrong for the shippers who are involved in this case and it would be wrong for shippers in other cases where the situation represented by the amicus in this case whose case in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is being delayed pending a decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.557" offset="15241592">The petitions here argue that a decision for the shippers would create an undue burden on the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.680" offset="15270118">I submit that this is a diversionary argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.891" offset="15282970">This case is not a typical 15 (8) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.604" offset="15293837">It is a very limited type of situation and it would occur very infrequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.774" offset="15314422">It would not occur any more often than the Alaska Pipeline type of situation would occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.205" offset="15340231">But more importantly, I submit that it is not the function of the courts to disregard the merits of individual cases in order to make life easier for the Commission of Railroads or even for the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.762" offset="15390386">The law clearly imposes on the Commission certain obligations and clearly grants two shippers the right of access to the courts to correct arbitrary action, abuse of discretion and other unlawful action.</text>

            <text syncTime="3836.855" offset="15450781">But isn't the question, is when that access is granted?</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold E. Spencer</label>
            <text syncTime="3839.870" offset="15462902">Yes, and I believe it's very clear that in this type of situation, that access should be granted when the Commissioner refuses to suspend and investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3850.488" offset="15505324">And I shall like to make it clear that I draw no distinction between suspension and investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3855.783" offset="15526536">The Commission in this case should have taken whatever action is necessary to prevent these tariffs from becoming effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.401" offset="15552972">Now, normally that would be rejection of the tariffs but suspension accomplishes the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.374" offset="15576900">So I say that either of those actions is reviewable and I believe for the very reasons that you heard here today, that the shippers need the protection of the courts more now than on any time of commission's history when the Commission is now engaged in a program of defect of deregulation without regard of the statutory standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.990" offset="15675329">Before our act which you've heard a good deal about today did not repeal Section 2 of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.459" offset="15701243">Section 2 prohibits personal discrimination in freight rates and I submit that if the railroads would attempt to raise rates for an individual and not for a corporation, or for women and not for men, no one could suggest that that could not be judicially reviewed at the time those rates became effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3920.601" offset="15785775">This case is no different because the whole history of the Commission says that when the shipper furnishes the car, he should be compensated by the payment of allowance which is what was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.027" offset="15839483">The petitioners here have studiously avoided any discussions of the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3939.867" offset="15862888">And I suggest that if they could refute to merits, they would have attempted to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3944.618" offset="15881801">Their principle argument is that we can make this same argument in the complaint case to the Commission and that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3950.627" offset="15905834">And that is true, we can.</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.075" offset="15915656">But I think that that is meaningless and irrelevant in this situation because why should be -- we be required to do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.398" offset="15944913">What do we need to know that we don't know already?</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.238" offset="15956302">There aren't any disputed issues of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.507" offset="15965393">We know that the railroads made a 20% increase in railroad cars but not in private cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3971.130" offset="15987858">We knew that the rates before the increase were the same and we know that the shippers whose furnished private cars are compensated by a published allowance as required by Section 15 paragraph (15) of the Act as it formally existed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold E. Spencer</label>
            <text syncTime="3993.480" offset="16077302">Because I don't -- because we want to settle this principle and I think in this case, what we had here was the seasonal rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.221" offset="16104260">We had a rate was in effect for three months and I believe that we were entitled to raise the issue in this case as to the right of the railroads to put this in discriminating between the two different types of cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="4016.200" offset="16168208">Now by the time the Court would reach the decision on the merits, the suspension problem had become moot because the rates were already in and were out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4025.040" offset="16203525">So, I think the issue could be settled but it is an extremely important question of principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="4031.160" offset="16227976">Now, they also say in the reply brief, they cite some cases which they say refutes our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.185" offset="16256084">This is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4039.942" offset="16263189">They say that in the you are rendered to arraign case that the Commission found lawful, rates of a million dollars a year and railroad furnished cars and $700,000.00 and shipper furnished cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.469" offset="16313240">That's an incorrect statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4054.037" offset="16319509">The Commission found the rates in a railroad equipment to be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="4058.234" offset="16336332">As a matter of fact, they found the whole rent a train scheme to be unlawful in so far as the railroads cars are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.237" offset="16364335">The other cases they cite, the other two cases arose during the period of federal control and more one and none of the cases was an allowance involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4076.614" offset="16409788">In the allowance, we don't deny that the railroads can publish rates in private cars, and that those rates would be different or could be different from the rates in railroad cars so long as they don't pay an allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.395" offset="16476975">There are rates to that effect today but what we say is that they can't do both.</text>
            <text syncTime="4097.313" offset="16492648">That they can't pay an allowance and then make a discriminatory rate on top of it and there is no case in the history of the Commission that says that they can up to this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.603" offset="16533817">So all we really want to do is to have the opportunity to show the reviewing court that the tariffs were in fact discriminatory as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4117.759" offset="16574360">And if we can't show that, we're out of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4120.599" offset="16585749">But if we can show it, then I think we're entitled of the relief that we ask for.</text>
            <text syncTime="4125.497" offset="16605393">And I would just like in closing to make one remark that I believe that the question of reviewability and the question of remedy selected by the Court below are really two different questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.613" offset="16653876">The court below correctly held that the Commission's action was reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4144.154" offset="16679999">Now, as I say when the case was first presented to the court below, they denied the TRO but they denied it on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4150.274" offset="16704449">They didn't deny it because of failure to have jurisdiction to hear that kind of an argument or to hear that kind of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4161.171" offset="16748022">They denied it on the balance of the equities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4164.688" offset="16762128">But I think that on the question of reviewability that it is very clear that that is reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.163" offset="16795982">Now, I suggested that since a straight question of law is involved that this Court can decide that question and simply tell the Eighth Circuit to order refunds in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4184.111" offset="16839868">I think also it would be quite appropriate for this Court simply to tell the Eighth Circuit to go ahead and decide the question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.307" offset="16872573">But I don't think an investigation is necessary as I say, we didn't ask for it.</text>
