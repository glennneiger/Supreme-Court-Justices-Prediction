            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Levander</label>
            <text syncTime="11.145" offset="147937">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.546" offset="161520">This case is here on a government’s petition to review a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.474" offset="193285">At issue is the interaction of the sentencing provisions of two separate titles of the federal gun laws, underlying a statutory decision of the court below of constitutional questions implicating the scope of prosecutorial discretion and validity of overlapping criminal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.248" offset="276355">At the outset, I would like to emphasize that there is no question here concerning the correctness of respondent’s conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.074" offset="307702">The only question presented concerns respondent’s sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.914" offset="327032">Following a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, respondent was convicted of one count of violating 18 U.S.C. 922 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="68.375" offset="376874">As this Court concluded in Barrett against United States, that statute unambiguously prohibits felons, such as respondent, from receiving a firearm that has traveled in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.435" offset="429119">The evidence supporting respondent’s conviction may be summarized briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.028" offset="447509">On July 31, 1975 respondent sold a .38 caliber pistol to a federal undercover agent for $70.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.567" offset="485648">At this time, respondent stated to the agent that he had received the gun following a burglary in St. Louis, and that in the recent past he had had and transferred other firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.599" offset="533817">Respondent stipulated to the facts at trial that the pistol had traveled in interstate commerce, and also to the fact that he had been previously convicted of a felony in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.384" offset="580942">The District Court sentenced respondent to five years imprisonment in accordance with Section 924 (a) of Title 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.801" offset="618559">That statute makes clear that a violation of Section 922 (h) is punishable by up to five years imprisonment and/or $5,000.00 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.665" offset="662026">On appeal, the Seventh Circuit affirmed respondent’s conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.173" offset="680103">A divided panel however, concluded that despite the expressed provisions of Section 924 (a) respondent can only be sentenced up to two years in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.596" offset="721795">The court’s conclusion was based on the fact that respondent’s receipt of a firearm also violated Section 1202 (a) of Title 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.108" offset="759829">And that provision carried only a two-year maximum penalty although it also carried a larger fine that is $10,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.933" offset="795146">The Court of Appeals felt this overlap raise serious constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.380" offset="816880">Its decision, however, accorded the rest on statutory grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.044" offset="835584">Judge McMillan dissented from the Court of Appeals decision noting that the overlap between the five-year statute and the two-year statute are very common among criminal statutes in Title 18, and that the Government has traditionally had the discretion to pursue a defendant under any of applicable statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="203.326" offset="916668">Do you think that’s analogous to the discretion of the prosecutor whether he should charge a first-degree murder for example or second degree murder or manslaughter, or is there an alternative?</text>

            <text syncTime="220.432" offset="985109">And this Court in Gregg against Georgia founded that that discretion to actually charge first-degree murder or not to charge didn’t violate the constitutional rates, constitutional difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.521" offset="1025442">It is also similar to the discretion of this Court upheld in Bordenkircher against Hayes.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.163" offset="1048012">That is the discretion of the prosecutor to -- in plea bargaining to add various counts or not add various counts.</text>

            <text syncTime="256.160" offset="1128051">Well, Your Honor I don’t think that is -- I think that’s the Court of Appeals conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.519" offset="1149471">I don’t think that’s true if one looks at the statutes carefully.</text>

            <text syncTime="266.799" offset="1170578">No, no even with respect to a convicted felon, there is a difference in the commerce clause element between these two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.144" offset="1207986">Following this Court’s decisions in Barrett, Bass and Scarborough there’s a difference between 1202 (a) which allows a defendant to be convicted if the firearm has either travelled interstate commerce or affected interstate commerce, whereas, Section 922 (h), the five-year statute, the firearm must have traveled interstate commerce.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="299.162" offset="1300041">Again in this case, it was stipulated that the firearm had traveled in interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="323.508" offset="1397426">There is -- there are several decisions of this Court in which if one looks at what the proof of the Government is in terms of none contested elements of the crime, this Court has upheld the conviction under one statute or another, or found that no lesser included offense was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.160" offset="1468061">In Spies and in Bishop and those series of tax cases, the Court noted that even if Congress had drafted exactly identical statutes that might be unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.494" offset="1509334">But they didn’t indicate in the least that those kind of identical statutes would be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.148" offset="1532008">And in those cases, the defendant claimed that it was unfair or that he was entitled to a lesser included offense in the situation in which there was a felony -- he was prosecuted for felony but his exact conduct and exact elements would also prove a misdemeanor.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="373.537" stopTime="395.433">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="373.537" offset="1597524">Mr. Levander, as we all know, there has been kicking around the Congress for quite a while now.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.882" offset="1626885">A proposed basic wholesale revision of the federal criminal code, would that Bill if it’s ever enacted eliminate all these overlaps and duplications or many of them?</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Levander</label>
            <text syncTime="395.433" offset="1685086">Well, it might eliminate some, however Section 1822 of S. 1437, that’s the current destination of the major provision of Title 18, contains both the equivalent of 922 (h), the five-year statute and 1202, and also continues to have a five-year penalty for the one and a two-year penalty for the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.010" offset="1779440">Although the fines are changed because under the revision, with my understanding Mr. Justice Stewart is that all felonies are punishable by certain standard fines.</text>

            <text syncTime="443.494" offset="1877347">There are many in Title 18, as we indicate in the brief in a long footnote, there are just numerous Sections which violate -- which are overlapping to either similar or 100%.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.023" offset="1931473">For instance 18 U.S.C. 1001, which is the false statement statute overlaps with several other provisions both in Title 18 and other Titles concerning false statements to various government agencies and --</text>

            <text syncTime="469.375" offset="1980897">An astute prosecutor could do it at least as well, and that’s the point, isn’t it?</text>

          <turn speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="474.238" stopTime="591.091">
            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Levander</label>
            <text syncTime="474.238" offset="2000332">That’s correct that traditionally the prosecutors had that discretion and a discretion to choose one statute or another is no greater discretion in the Government’s view than the discretion not to charge at all or.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.511" offset="2065429">The Court’s statutory decision which was basically that where a defendant’s conduct violates both a two-year -- the two-year provision and the five-year provision, he may only get the two-year sentence, was based on three maxims of statutory construction, principles of implied repeal, lenity and avoidance of constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.852" offset="2166784">The -- it is well-established in the cases of this Court that implied repeals are disfavored in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.408" offset="2208998">And only where the two statutes in question will be clearly repugnant to one another will this Court hold that one statute has impliedly repealed another.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.930" offset="2251107">However, here we clearly do not have repugnant statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.500" offset="2265422">The statutes viewed as a whole, cover very different grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.791" offset="2282559">As the Court noted in Bass, the two statutes cover very different kinds of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.100" offset="2307741">For instance, in the five-year statute, fugitives from justice and addicts are covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.958" offset="2331251">And in the two-year statute, you have illegal aliens, ex-citizens and other groups which are not covered in the five-year statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.326" offset="2368658">Moreover, as I pointed out in response to Mr. Justice Stewart’s question a moment ago, the commerce clause element of the two statutes are quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.134" offset="2399901">And there are also differences in the conduct which is prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.202" offset="2420172">The five-year statute only goes to receipt of a firearm, whereas the two-year statute goes to receipt, transportation, and possession.</text>

            <text syncTime="602.145" offset="2511914">I think that the answer would probably be not, Mr. Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.046" offset="2527587">I think that for instance in the Eighth Circuit recently there was a decision called White in which certiorari was denied recently, in which the defendant was convicted on both receiving under 922 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="623.174" offset="2596028">And he was also convicted of transportation under 1202.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.347" offset="2612746">And in that sort of circumstance, I think that the Government would argue and did argue that consecutive punishment would be possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.988" offset="2655274">Not only are implied repeals disfavored, but normally one would think that implied repeal involves two statutes, one which is enacted after another.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.447" offset="2693204">Here however, the two statutes, the five-year statute and the two-year statute were enacted at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.140" offset="2715982">One is Title IV and one is -- the other is Title VII of the Omnibus Crime Control Act, and Safe Streets Act of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.416" offset="2749001">And it is very difficult to understand how it’s possible that two statutes which are enacted at the same time could possibly be an implied repeal of one or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.698" offset="2786200">And indeed, the same Congress which enacted both statutes shortly thereafter reenacted both statutes with a different penalties in the Gun Control Act of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.111" offset="2831862">And at that time the Senate specifically considered raising the five-year statute to be a ten-year maximum penalty, although this provision was later deleted in conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.607" offset="2885778">But Congress was clearly aware of the two statutes, treated them as separate statutes and enacted and reenacted them, and obviously understood them to be self-fluctuating and separate gun titles.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.349" offset="2944815">The second principle of statutory interpretation upon which the Court of Appeals relied is the principle of lenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.566" offset="2981595">And it is true that where a criminal statute is ambiguous, this Court has often stated that it would be construed to benefit the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.741" offset="3030288">Here however, we submit there is no ambiguity whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.674" offset="3050036">There’s certainly no ambiguity as the conduct prohibited, the Court so stated in Barrett.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.084" offset="3075741">And as to the penalty, 924 (a) without exception provides whoever violates the provision of this chapter in Section 924 (h), the five-year statute is part of that chapter, maybe punishable by up to five years imprisonment and a $5,000.00 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.906" offset="3138957">There is no cross-reference or any indication of an exception in that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.255" offset="3160377">Section 1202, the two-year statute on the other hand both sets out prohibited conduct and immediately after says that anyone who does this conduct shall be punished by up to two years imprisonment and a maximum $10,000.00 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.012" offset="3219414">And it also is very unambiguous and it permits structure in its language, it appears to be just a self-contained statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.862" offset="3250866">The penalty applies just to those violations that are set forth in the two-year statute, and there’s no cross-reference in that statute to the five-year statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.073" offset="3299662">Moreover, the legislative history indicates that there is no ambiguity here, and that Congress clearly intended that the five-year statute and the two-year statutes be prosecuted and enforced separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.463" offset="3349191">The two-year statute was added as an amendment in the legislative process to the Omnibus Crime Control Act, and Senator Long was the sponsor of the two-year statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.390" offset="3392972">And he stated that this statute is not intended to take anything from but rather to add to “the existing penalties and provisions” of Title IV that is the five-year statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.096" offset="3459741">And again the legislative history of the Gun Control Act which is the second Act that was passed by Congress in 1968 concerning these matters shows that Congress treated the two statutes separately in separate Titles of the Gun Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.783" offset="3522539">It viewed them as separate parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.688" offset="3530167">The language suggested they’re separate parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.029" offset="3543437">Finally, I would note that the Court of Appeals suggested that allowing a defendant to be sentenced to five years when his conduct also violated a two-year statute would be an absurd result or an unfair result.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.184" offset="3600071">But I think that this Court of Appeals decision and analysis may create the difficult results.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.080" offset="3631731">For example, the Court of Appeals in footnote 5 of its decision refused to address the question which fine provision of the two statutes would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.989" offset="3671333">Now the five-year penalty statute carries the $5,000.00 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.233" offset="3688260">The two-year statute carries a $10,000.00 fine. If it is the doctrine of implied repeal that is applicable, well then seemingly, the $10,000.00 greater fine that’s found in the two-year statute would be the applicable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.078" offset="3747715">If it is the doctrine of lenity that’s controlling, then in seemingly it would be the $5,000.00 fine that’s found in the five-year statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="935.957" offset="3847189">That’s correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.997" offset="3851368">But the fact that it didn’t indicates -- I mean that that question raises some serious problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.434" offset="3877073">I think another absurd result that might result from this decision is that Section 922 (h) (1) under which the respondent was prosecuted and convicted applies not only to those who have been convicted of a felony but those who are under indictment for a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.442" offset="3949171">There is no such equivalent provision in the two-year statute, therefore a defendant who was under indictment at the time that he received the firearm could still get the five-year penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.188" offset="4000162">But a day later, when he was convicted his penalty, the penalty -- maximum penalty would be limited to two years under the Court of Appeals analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.047" offset="4039555">The third maxim that the court relied on is the maxim that where possible, the court should construe a statute to avoid a serious constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.319" offset="4088665">In the Government’s view, there are no serious constitutional questions here, but in any event, that the avoidance of a constitutional question is only possible where the statutes -- the statutes in question may be fairly read in alternative fashions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.705" offset="4150209">Here, there’s just, as I said in regard to the maxim of lenity, there’s no ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.982" offset="4171316">There’s only one reading that’s fairly possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.158" offset="4179989">And as this Court held in Swain against Presley and that sort of a situation, the Court cannot avoid the constitutional question and must face it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.730" offset="4230248">Turning to the question of the constitutional -- underlying constitutional questions, as I’ve indicated, the two statutes although in application in this case have similar proof involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.508" offset="4285419">They are very different, the scope of the two statutes, the person’s activities and the commerce clause element are very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.112" offset="4323871">And indeed as this Court recognized both in Bass and in Scarborough, it may well have been that Congress thought that it was enacting in a two-year statute, a statute along the lines of Perez.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.782" offset="4366503">That is a statute not requiring individualized proof of commerce clause jurisdiction in each and every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.356" offset="4396805">And in so far as the Congress thought that it was doing that, the two statutes were very much different as to their commerce clause nexus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.822" offset="4430660">After the decisions in Bass, Barrett and Scarborough they are still different although the gap is not quite as great.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.995" offset="4467336">We mentioned before that the Government has always suggested and this Court has always followed that the prosecutor has large discretion in charging and in choosing the statute under which to prosecute or not prosecute a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.008" offset="4543404">In part that that discretion is based on the constitution itself, Article 2, Section 3 of the Constitution and the doctrine of the separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.876" offset="4582902">The only limitation on that prosecutorial discretion as indicated in Bordenkircher and in Oyler is where the prosecutor exercises his discretion on the basis of arbitrary or unconstitutional factors, such as race or religion or gender or something of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.325" offset="4660642">There’s no assertion in this case that there -- that the prosecution was based on any of those factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.177" offset="4696064">And indeed, looking at the record one can well imagine why the prosecutor chose to pursue the respondent under the five-year statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.573" offset="4729710">He had been convicted of murder in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.943" offset="4739114">He had a very long record before then and some 20 other prior convictions of some sort or other, including I think a felony conviction for writing in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.241" offset="4776312">And shortly after he’d been released from prison following his murder conviction, he was proceeding to apparently sell guns and trading guns, not only the gun in question but apparently he mentioned that he had had other guns in the recent past and had transferred those as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.736" offset="4854366">So the question becomes where could possibly statutes which have different elements be unconstitutional where they are clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.314" offset="4884668">And here, the conduct prohibited is clear, and the penalty provided for each of the two statutes is quite clear and there’s no exception made in under either statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.350" offset="4928763">The Court of Appeals and respondent suggest that the two statutes are identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.369" offset="4944854">And we would submit that even where the statutes were identical, there would be unconstitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.212" offset="4980172">As long as it was clear that Congress intended there would be separate statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.001" offset="4995427">This Court has indicated in Bell and in other cases that the major limitation on constitutional limitation on Congress’ power to enact separate statutes with different penalties or on to set the penalties for a criminal violation is the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.912" offset="5054986">And there’s certainly no claim here that these statutes violate the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.794" offset="5074526">It is arguable -- I suppose that if you have identical statutes that there might be some sort of due process violation in terms of notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.852" offset="5102738">However, the due process notice line of cases seems to focus mainly on the conduct prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.410" offset="5128965">And here the conduct prohibited is very clearly prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.180" offset="5140041">It’s prohibited by two statutes not just one as regards with respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.983" offset="5155297">And there is less reason for the criminal law to be so precise in the penalty provision in the sense that for instance the kidnapping statute provides that the defendant who is convicted of kidnapping may be punished by anywhere from zero to life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.729" offset="5242337">So it’s clear that that kind of -- and that statute is not been held as unconstitutional, the breadth of its statutory provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.208" offset="5276191">Here, it’s much even narrower one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.647" offset="5281938">It’s from zero to five or if it’s under the three-year statute, from zero to two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.832" offset="5302732">Lastly, I would point out that there is no unfairness to defendants if they’re prosecuted under the one statute or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.212" offset="5328227">If a defendant’s conduct constitutes some horrible acts or in need of strict punishment, he can get more than five -- two years under the five-year statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.955" offset="5391235">If he is lucky enough to have been charged on the two-year statute, that’s fortuitous and he only gets the maximum two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.291" offset="5420492">And that kind of fortuitous mercy, this Court in Gregg against Georgia it said did not violate the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.427" offset="5449122">And those defendants whose conduct is punishable by less than two years will receive less than two years under both statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.763" offset="5478379">I would like to reserve the remainder of my time if there are no further questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1357.341" offset="5532714">Section 922 (h) is a very severe and strict statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.617" offset="5569808">It doesn’t make any difference how long the interstate commerce took place as in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.668" offset="5598020">It took place 30 years ago prior to the time he was charged with the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.079" offset="5623724">It doesn’t make any difference whether or not he had been previously convicted of an offense in which he got probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.813" offset="5658624">Once he’d been convicted of a felony then he comes within that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.467" offset="5681194">922 has history way back to 1933 where practically the same statute was involved in the Federal Arms Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.325" offset="5736678">Later on 1968, it was included in the Omnibus Crime Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.425" offset="5761024">And it covers situation where a defendant is under indictment as well as being convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.046" offset="5799581">Now, this may create a problem, its remarkable none of these problems has surfaced and I think they’re going to begin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.433" offset="5833122">Supposed you had a case where a man was convicted under this 922 (h) and later on the other case in which he was under indictment, he was acquitted, what do you do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.038" offset="5887561">It refers to fugitives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.172" offset="5896025">It’s a fugitive for all the crime, what crimes are we talking about?</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.652" offset="5917968">Parking tickets may be a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.164" offset="5927999">Abandoning a wife may be a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.796" offset="5946598">You have another provision referring to those adjudicated as mental defectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.752" offset="5970422">I can’t imagine charging a mental defective of receiving a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.534" offset="5985468">I’ve never heard of a case such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.049" offset="5995604">But this was intended, this statute, this Omnibus Bill is intended to prevent crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.182" offset="6024129">It could’ve been a very simple thing to have said among other things knowing under the age of 21 or 24 years of age shall receive a gun, or sell them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.404" offset="6068955">I think that kind of a provision would really have brought down the incidents of crime in America but Congress didn’t want to go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.731" offset="6110333">Now then we have the Amendment of 1202.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.330" offset="6132694">Now this is a last minute amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.701" offset="6150144">Senator Long came along with an amendment and he was asked if it was a substitute for the Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.052" offset="6183581">And all he said was “They did a good job.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.932" offset="6195075">Meaning the committee did a good job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.210" offset="6204165">“But my amendment takes nothing from the Bill.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.324" offset="6216704">He could’ve very well have said “this is or is another amendment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.194" offset="6236139">And so he offers it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.592" offset="6241782">And there’s no conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.991" offset="6251290">There’s no debate about it and there are changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.528" offset="6277517">It includes those convicted of crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.126" offset="6291832">It refers to those that charge from the Armed Services under dishonorable conditions, I don’t know what that means.</text>

            <text syncTime="2176.644" offset="8809932">I raise the question before this Court that in as much as the Court of Appeals said there are serious questions about the constitutionality of both of these sections that perhaps they ought to be declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.317" offset="8868655">I see no great harm if both these sections were declared unconstitutional and Congress rewrote them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.694" offset="8894151">I see so many problems that could arise, eventually from all these -- from prosecutions under both statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.283" offset="8928528">And as the Solicitor General pointed out, the anomalies that are here proves my point that there are really problems with both.</text>

            <text syncTime="2216.862" offset="8970846">These statutes are passed fast because they wanted -- the Congress wants to show the public they’re doing something to prevent crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="2243.831" offset="9078680">And in our present case for instance, upon a voir dire by the court of the jurors after the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.579" offset="9109713">They wanted to know what the defendant was convicted of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.944" offset="9131133">You know, it gets to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.091" offset="9135731">This is a tough case to fight in the courts where the indictment reaches them previously convicted of a felony, sometimes it creeps out what kind of a felony he is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.689" offset="9178154">And jurors they can talk about anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.561" offset="9185573">For instance in this case the record will show they wanted to know why that Mr. Bellows come down the (Inaudible) and try the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2291.040" offset="9267493">Now then as I stated that we have submitted the Court to consider the question as to whether or not both sections could be declared to be unconstitutional and it would be no great loss really, because it could be rewritten and a better job could be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.332" offset="9356727">Finally, we suggest that the amendment by Senator Long was really a repeal of 922 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.167" offset="9400090">When he was asked “Is this a substitute” he didn’t talk, he didn’t answer it and maybe he didn’t want to start a rumpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.964" offset="9431228">But he just said “They did a fine job and it’ll help.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.356" offset="9460799">And anyway, it’s not they weren’t simultaneously passed, 922 came before the 1202 (a), 922 (h) came way back in 1933, so it wasn’t something new.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.976" offset="9531225">It’s been on the books for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.047" offset="9543555">And there was an established rule that if there exist a conflict in the same Act the last provision must control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.460" offset="9569259">And I would submit to the Court that the 1202 (a) could be considered as a repeal of 922 (h).</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Levander</label>
            <text syncTime="2381.173" offset="9628087">Just a couple quick points if I might, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.343" offset="9640730">First I would mention that although Section 922 (h) has its origins in a 1933 statute, the Federal Firearm Act, the statutes are very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.239" offset="9680332">The penalties were changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.753" offset="9686392">A presumption was eliminated that was in one statute and in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.508" offset="9697364">And the statutes were radically different in their scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.326" offset="9712724">Secondly, respondent suggests that Senator Long was not clear as to what he said when he introduced the Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.178" offset="9748041">However, Senator Dowd asked him “Do I correctly understand that this amendment is not a substitute for Title IV?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.813" offset="9774582">Answer, “This amendment would take nothing from the Bill, if I applaud what the committee did, this would add to the final work the committee did in this area.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.726" offset="9810317">And lastly, respondent suggests that the prosecutors across the country, federal prosecutors are always using 922 (h), the five-year statute as opposed to the two-year statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.659" offset="9857964">However, statistics from 1977 and 1978 show that firearm prosecution is brought under one statute or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.958" offset="9887222">About 40% were brought under the two-year statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.403" offset="9901014">Now, I don’t know exactly how many of those cases could only have brought -- been brought under the two-year statute because of the commerce clause element, but I suggest that the statistics indicate that the prosecutors are exercising their discretion in accordance with the factors that this Court approved in a footnote in Lovasco in which we cite in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.906" offset="9971022">If there are no further question.</text>
