            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="8.020" offset="32078">It's Scott against Illinois which involves the question of whether or not the right to counsel is established in Argersinger against Hamlin seven years ago should be extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.092" offset="112327">In Argersinger, we held that an indigent may not be imprisoned unless at his trial he was afforded the right of assistance of counsel at the State's expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.423" offset="153600">Since that time, there's been some difference among state courts and in some of the other federal courts as to whether Argersinger fully defined the right to appointed counsel or whether there might be other circumstances where the State might be required to appoint counsel, such as when imprisonment is an authorized penalty under statute but not actually imposed on the defendant in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.748" offset="250984">The petitioner in this case was convicted, an Illinois of shoplifting merchandise value that less than $150.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.870" offset="279406">He was fined $50 after a trial before a judge but was not imprisoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.124" offset="300408">He argued in this case that because imprisonment is a possible penalty for shoplifting in Illinois, the State should have been required to provide him with an attorney at the State's expense even though he was not sentenced to any imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.949" offset="351713">The Illinois Supreme Court rejected his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.894" offset="363520">It held that the appointment of counsel was not warranted by this Court's opinion in Argersinger.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.721" offset="386821">And we granted certiorari in order to resolve the conflicting views on the meaning of that opinion and of the right to counsel claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.299" offset="421094">Today, we agree with the Supreme Court of Illinois that our 1972 opinion in Argersinger against Hamlin did indeed set the limits of the accused indigent's right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.097" offset="464353">We think that imprisonment is so severe of sanction that it warrants special status for Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.823" offset="495282">The actual imprisonment line drawn in Argersinger has proved reasonably workable whether there's any extension we believe would create confusion and imposed unpredictable and necessarily substantial cause on 50 quite diverse states.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.338" offset="553273">We therefore hold that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution require only that no indigent criminal defendant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment unless the State has afforded him the right to assistance of appointive counsel in his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.736" offset="614922">The judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois is accordingly affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.773" offset="631014">Mr. Justice Powell while joining the opinion of the Court has filed a separate concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.970" offset="655778">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice Stevens joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.720" offset="682841">Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
