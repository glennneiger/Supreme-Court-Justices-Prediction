            <label>Ms. Barbara A. H. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="92.198" offset="472168">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.128" offset="483871">I’m Barbara A. H. Smith, I am an Assistant Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.864" offset="494843">I represent the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the petitioner in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.250" offset="512397">The Commonwealth seeks review of a decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, which interpreted this Court’s decision in Miranda versus Arizona as requiring per say automatic exclusion of statements obtained in violation of the Miranda's prophylactic safe-guards for the purpose of establishing probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.210" offset="600168">Specifically the Court held that it was err for the trial judge to had denied the defendant Charles Whites’ motion to suppress certain physical evidence, which had been seized pursuant to a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.369" offset="648861">The affidavit in support of the search warrant was based upon statements which the Trail Court had held should be suppressed to trail because they were obtained in violation of the waybill requirement of Miranda versus Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.961" offset="703195">The Supreme Judicial Court therefore reversed the defendant’s conviction on four entitlements charging possession of the controlled substance with intend to distribute.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.337" offset="740707">As the Commonwealth’s belief that the facts and the circumstances surrounding the taking of the statements at issue is a crucial relevance to the application of the exclusionary rule and therefore I will devote myself to explication of those facts with some particularity.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.898" offset="806954">The motion to suppress both the Arresting Officer and the State Trooper, who received the statements, testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.490" offset="837360">The Arresting Officer testified that on 2 AM in March of 1975, he was informed of a motor vehicle accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.875" offset="870902">He proceeded to the scene of the accident and observed that a car had been driven over in an embankment knocking down several highway posts.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.340" offset="900681">He observed the defendant Charles White in the car at the bottom of the embankment attempting to drive it back up.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.044" offset="927535">The defendant asked the police officer for a push.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.250" offset="940387">The officer determined that, that was not going to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.251" offset="956374">At the same time, noticed that the defendant’s speech was slurred, his eyes were glassy and he noticed a strong odor of alcohol.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.114" offset="991796">This time the police officer instructed the defendant to turn off the motor of the car to get out, instructed him that he was placing him under arrest for driving under the influence of liquor and he advised him on his rights under Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.787" offset="1050520">The defendant at this point expressed some concern that the dawn light of his car would not turn off and he was afraid his battery would run down.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.094" offset="1083747">However he agreed to accompany the police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.625" offset="1097853">They then walked up the embankment and there was testimony from the police officer that the defendant did stagger but he walked up the embankment unassisted.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.949" offset="1135156">They were then met by the State Police Trooper, who agreed to have the car drove to the State Police Barracks and to go forward and arrange for a breathalyzer test.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.309" offset="1180609">When the defendant and the Arresting Officer arrived at the State Police Barracks, the State Trooper again advised the defendant of his right under Miranda, he advised him of right to remain silent, a right to have an attorney present, that anything he said wouldn’t be used against him and he had a right to have an attorney appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.090" offset="1263783">He further advised him under Massachusetts law of his right to take or refuse a breathalyzer test and of the consequences of refusal, which in Massachusetts would be a 90 day suspension of license.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.005" offset="1311431">He further advised the defendant of his statutory right to make a telephone call and to have a blood test conducted at his own expense by his own physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.918" offset="1347062">The defendant responded as to the breathalyzer test that he felt he would loose his license either way so he as might as well take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.229" offset="1380289">He also indicated that he wanted to make some phone calls.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.868" offset="1394813">In the course of warming up the breathalysing machine, the defendant placed at least two phone calls, both of which were apparently in an attempt to secure the services of an attorney and to arrange for bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.592" offset="1461791">A part of these telephone conversations were overheard by both officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.104" offset="1479764">However he was apparently unsuccessful in retaining the services of an attorney at 2’o clock in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.378" offset="1508916">Also there was testimony that in attempting to use the pay telephone, the defendant drop coins on the floor and had difficulty in picking them up.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.403" offset="1544965">A breathalyzer test was administered and the percentage by weight of the alcohol found in the defendant’s bloodstream was 13-100.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.894" offset="1590941">Under Massachusetts law, anything over 0.10 arises a statutory, rebuttable presumption that one is under the influence of alcohol for the purpose of driving a motor vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.008" offset="1643395">The State Police Trooper described the defendant during taking the breathalyzer test and making the phone calls as being in his opinion under the influence of alcohol that he was bouncing around, that he was scratching incessantly and that he was dropping coins.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.083" offset="1703685">However he also testified he had no trouble conversing with the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.782" offset="1722493">The defendant indicatedly understood this rights when given and that there was no interrogation of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.583" offset="1749661">However prior to placing the defendant in a cell having completed all the arrangement procedures, the Trooper searched him and found a marijuana cigarette in the breast pocket of the shirt.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.207" offset="1812250">He at that time felt it was a new ball game and advised the defendant he would be charged with a possession of marijuana and again advised him of his rights under Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.670" offset="1854046">The defendant responded --</text>

            <text syncTime="445.017" offset="1883408">The defendant said something to the effect, ‘I don’t think possession of a single cigarette is a crime’.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.131" offset="1907858">The trooper responded, ‘well, do you have any more on your purse or in your car’ and the defendant responded, ‘yes, I have more in my vehicle’.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.019" offset="1939414">The trooper -- then the defendant attempted to say ‘I can name you some biggies, apparently in reference to some narcotic dealers and the State Police Trooper said, ‘I don’t to hear anything more and placed the defendant in a holding cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.374" offset="2000854">He then prepared an affidavit and an application for a search warrant relating the arrest of the defendant and his response to the question about the marijuana cigarette, I want a cigarette.</text>

            <text syncTime="893.973" offset="3679274">Rather the mandatory exclusion, the admission of the statement on submit depends on an examination of whether a defendant’s right to cut off questioning was fruitlessly honored.</text>

            <text syncTime="3016.258" offset="12168443">In both instances, at bar to the use of evidence, reinstates the parties to their respective positions, and upholds the privilege against self incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.448" offset="12213164">Concerning the respondent’s final argument namely that even if Miranda, even if the Fifth Amendment and Sixth Amendment were not violated that even under the rational of Michigan versus Tucker that the evidence in the case at bar should still be suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.158" offset="12280038">Respondent respectfully suggests that the interests of Michigan versus Tucker that the government in making all available evidences to the persons or people who have to determine the facts is outweighed in the case at bar by the need to deter police misconduct by concepts of judicial integrity and by the very nature of our accusatory system of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.575" offset="12385677">It is submitted that the allowance into evidence of the property seize pursuant to the search warrant would encourage police violations of the law because they will have everything to gain and nothing to lose by interrogating defendant without obtaining a valid waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.962" offset="12443251">Suppression of the contraband and money is necessary to exhibit to the police the fact of judicial disapproval and makes constitutional rights credible to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.915" offset="12487032">Respondent also suggests the doubt as to the effectiveness of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule in deterring police misconduct is not applicable to the Fifth and Sixth Amendment area of the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.915" offset="12539068">This is so is because one legal scholar has pointed out the predominant goal of interrogation is to obtain evidence for it’s used in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.203" offset="12576162">Therefore police conduct in this area is likely to be responsive to judicial rules of exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.588" offset="12605733">Additionally the respondent respectfully suggests that the good faith factor mentioned in Michigan versus Tucker is not applicable to the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.414" offset="12641050">The interrogation in this case was post-Miranda and the respondent repeatedly attempted to secure counsel and never abandon his effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.110" offset="12675845">Indeed the State Trooper questioned the respondent knowing that Mr. White had not waived his rights to silence and to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.764" offset="12706461">That’s what the Superior Court and the Supreme Judicial Court found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.463" offset="12721194">Alternatively respondent argues that some policy reasons argue against the use of a good faith defense in situations like the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.405" offset="12757034">A good faith defense puts the premium on ignorance of the law and would be an additional – it would add an additional and exceptionally difficult fact finding process to the already overburdened criminal law process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.255" offset="12812413">Further the existence of such a defense could generate uncertainty and invite calculated risks on the part of the police, thereby defeating the primary goal of Miranda to give to the police concrete constitutional guidelines.</text>

            <text syncTime="3630.815" offset="14626670">I’d like to respond to a question of Justice Stevens, prior to the lunch break regarding this Sixth Amendment right to counsel a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.020" offset="14659480">I would suggest it under Kirby v. Illinois that no judicial proceedings had been initiated and the Sixth Amendment right does not apply, this is not a Brewer v. Williams case in any respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.241" offset="14704306">As to the allegation that there was an independent state ground for this decision, I would first like to point out to the court that on page 70 of the appendix, the defendant's Assignment of Error read as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.280" offset="14752475">Evidence was obtained as a violation of the defendant’s right under the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth Amendments of the constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.400" offset="14781001">He did not assign its error any violation under the constitution of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.591" offset="14801690">Furthermore in the two reference decisions in the White case Hass and Hall, there are references to federal cases, particularly Miranda versus Arizona, and Brown versus Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.966" offset="14847248">In none of the referenced cases, in those two decisions or in the reference cases, in those decisions, there is any discussion of the Massachusetts’s constitution of probabition against compelled testimony to take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.139" offset="14903881">There is simple no ambiguity in the basis for decision in this case.</text>
