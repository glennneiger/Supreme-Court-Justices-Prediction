            <label>Mr. Jack B. Levitt</label>
            <text syncTime="11.475" offset="149295">Mr. Chief Justice and if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.776" offset="162461">The principal issue presented in this appeal is whether a litigant loses his constitutional right to a trial jury by estoppel when the issue to be decided has been adjudicated adversely to him in a prior SEC injunction action, at which, there was no right to a trial by jury and, in which, its present adversary was not a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.796" offset="254516">The facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.852" offset="262771">Parklane Hosiery affected a going private transaction in October 1974 by means of a merger in which a proxy was issued to its shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.313" offset="308642">A month later, in November 1974, this class action was commenced on behalf of all the stockholders of the corporation, except those who had exercised their statutory dissenter's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.547" offset="361514">The class action proceeded to a class certification and to commencement of discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.618" offset="397876">In May 1976, a year-and-a half after the class action had began and after the merger had been accomplished, the SEC, under the authority of Section 21 of the 1934 Exchange Act authorizing injunction actions, commenced an action for an injunction and other relief alleging as its grounds certain-claimed material misrepresentations and omissions by Parklane in its proxy state-- proxy statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.750" offset="526399">Two weeks after, the SEC started its independent action.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.409" offset="544998">The respondents here, the plaintiffs in the class action, moved to amend their complaint so as to precisely track, to fall in behind, the allegations of the SEC injunction complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.324" offset="608632">Pursuant to rules which permit prompt trial of SEC injunction actions, the SEC injunction action came on to be tried with about one month after it was commenced, in June of 1976 and while the class action here was in an early stage of discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.463" offset="705181">After trial, in September 1976, the district judge who had heard the SEC injunction proceeding found that Parklane had violated the securities laws in the three precise respects that the SEC had alleged, the three material omissions or misrepresentations.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.680" offset="782085">But, the district judge denied the injunction which was the route remedy that the SEC had requested on the grounds that there was no basis for an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.802" offset="822627">That the merger had long since been accomplished that there was no evidence and not even a contention, as I understand it, that there was any ongoing conduct that would suggest a concern-- a public concern for continuing wrongs or violations of the securities law.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.151" offset="904025">Just after the judgment in the SEC proceeding in November, I believe, 1976, the respondent here moved for partial summary judgment on the issues which had been adjudicated in the SEC non-jury injunction proceeding on the theory that, because the SEC injunction proceeding had included similar issues of fact, the petitioner here was collaterally estopped from re-litigating those issues.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="232.039" offset="1031502">Do you say “similar,” are they more than similar?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack B. Levitt</label>
            <text syncTime="239.861" offset="1062849">They are precisely the same, Mr. Justice Burger, as the issues contained in the amended complaint or embraced in the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.426" offset="1109034">There were some other claims in the class action and, of course, there would be other issues, at least including damages, still for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.510" offset="1137455">That's the sense in which it was a motion for partial summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.470" offset="1153233">But, to answer what I believe is the purpose of one of your question, Mr. Chief Justice, yes, the request for partial summary judgment was co-extensive with the findings of violation that had been-- that had occurred in the SEC proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.838" offset="1230764">The District Court denied the motion for partial summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.101" offset="1251767">In a short decision, motion denied and relying on the Fifth Amendment -- on the Fifth Circuit decision in Rachal against Hill, a 1970 Fifth Circuit decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.914" offset="1298996">On appeal, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court, directed the entry of the summary judgment which had been requested and, in effect, determine that the application of the Doctrine of Collateral Estoppel in this instance or to extinguish the right to a trial jury that the petitioner otherwise concededly would've had.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.981" offset="1383320">This appeal presents to the Court for the first time, since this Court's decision in Blonder-Tongue, a question of the proper reach and application of the Doctrine of Collateral Estoppel in the absence of mutuality.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.435" offset="1441102">And, petitioners contend here very briefly that the test, the historical inquiry, as to the law in 1791 as a basis for determining the scope and limits of Seventh Amendment jury trial rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.863" offset="1518843">If applied in accordance with what we contend is a fairly straightforward following of the cases of this Court, Dimick against Schiedt and, very recently, Curtis against Loether and others, demonstrate that respondent couldn't have been estopped collaterally from a jury trial of his defenses in 1791 or, indeed, until the very recent relaxation of the mutuality of estoppels rule and can't now be so-estopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.616" offset="1629811">We believe also that that result is squarely consistent with this Court's decisions in Beacon Theatres, Dairy Queen, and other cases and that the Rachal decision, the Fifth Circuit decision in 1970 which, until this case, was the only case which presented an interface or a challenge to the Seventh Amendment by the new concept of non-mutual estoppel which had held to the contrary that a jury trial could not be extinguished by this mechanism, quite properly analyze the law, and this Court's decisions on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.529" offset="1785501">And, finally, we'll contend that this Court's refusal, for which of course we shall contend, to apply collateral estoppel in the circumstances presented in this case would be wholly consistent with the Blonder-Tongue principle that it is a -- that non-mutual estoppels, even if the formal elements may be present, should not be applied where justice and equity dictate otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.872" offset="1886856">Now, Your Honors, before analysis or reference to the decision in the Court below, I'll briefly summarize to you the Fifth Circuit decision in Rachal.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.921" offset="1927084">There, the SEC had sought and obtained an injunction against corporate behavior in an SE -- in a securities law violation context.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.958" offset="1967208">Thereafter, a class action had been begun and the class action plaintiffs, using the SEC judgment as its predicate, sought partial -- sought summary judgment much as is being attempted on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.006" offset="2027395">There, the Fifth Circuit squarely held that collateral estoppel may not be applied so as to deny a Seventh Amendment jury trial right.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.432" offset="2065115">And, in so doing, the Court ackn -- confronted the challenge of the Seventh Amendment in the face of this new procedure -- relatively new procedural mechanism, and acknowledged also that the change in the rules of mutuality still then emerging, and I believe still now emerging, but noted that the rule should not apply where overriding issues of fairness dictate otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.490" offset="2169292">The Rachal Court, the Fifth Circuit Court, analyzed this Court's decision in Beacon Theatres, referred to the great respect which its language and its decision showed to the preeminence of the Seventh Amendment in the face of changing procedural mechanisms, in that case, the federal rules, and found that the Beacon decision led, inevitably, to the denial of estoppel.</text>

            <text syncTime="551.409" offset="2308995">And, let's assume that a patent had held to be -- was held to be invalid in the Second Circuit and then in the Third Circuit, and that had been done in a non-jury trial because nobody had asked for jury determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.188" offset="2384123">And then, in the Third Circuit, the issue of the -- that same patent's validity was raised in litigation, and the person asserting the validity of the patent said “well, I want a jury trial on this issue.”</text>
            <text syncTime="584.355" offset="2440756">Does that mean that the matter of estoppel just could not possibly prevail because of the Seventh Amendment right to jury trial?</text>

            <text syncTime="617.381" offset="2572936">The original determination of invalidity was made in a non-jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.411" offset="2589027">Now, the same issue is raised in a different Circuit involving the validity of the same patent, and the person asserting its validity says “I want a jury trial and there cannot possibly be collateral estoppel because there wasn't jury trial in the other case.”</text>

            <text syncTime="653.800" offset="2718595">The question is whether the party who had a litigated -- who had litigated the case earlier, in this case the -- in the Blonder-Tongue case, the alleged patent holder who had initiated a litigation and who, in the litigation which he had initiated, was met with the finding of invalidity of the -- of his own patent.</text>

            <text syncTime="710.627" offset="2945860">I would comment upon your question to say that there has been much writing and speculation about the distinction, if any, and the weight which ought to be accorded to it between the so-called defensive use of mutual estoppel and the so-called offensive use.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.753" offset="3030392">I say “so-called” because many people contend perhaps with some force, that here isn't a profound or a structural distinction between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.520" offset="3069471">I don't think it, at all, affects the line of reasoning or the ultimate decision by this Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.624" offset="3101863">I would say, however, in response to your question that I find some concern in the issue of whether -- I find a somewhat different standard, a somewhat different test, probably in order, in considering whether a subsequent litigant can exploit a successful litigation by a predecessor and follow it by attempting to get summary judgment, attempted to get judgment almost by hypothesis on the basis of that earlier adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.418" offset="3237073">I would be concerned about many factors affecting the earlier adjudication and its implication for the party who had not been a party to it and who is now faced with confrontation of the same issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="851.982" offset="3511254">First I -- Your Honor, let me address myself to your question in the following fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.258" offset="3608430">I believe that the offense -- so-called offensive use and this case, to my knowledge, and as well as the Rachal case in the Fifth Circuit presents the first such proposition for it --</text>

            <text syncTime="891.890" offset="3670915">Deserves a different test.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.395" offset="3680946">I do not think, Your Honors, that it will be crucial by almost any line of reasoning to Your Honors' decision because I think this case will more than likely be presented primarily on the issue of its Seventh Amendment implications, but what -- but I do believe that the level of examination, the concern, about who was involved in the prior adjudication and what were the implications of the circumstances of that prior adjudication for the party sought to be estopped by it, and the second action of who was innocent, that is to say, who was innocent of any participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.820" offset="3834650">Who had no participation in the earlier action, probably, should be a higher standard and should be a matter of concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.795" offset="3862549">And, to try and follow that for what use I believe it may have for the facts in this case, I think the fact that this case -- that the prior adjudication was an SEC injunction proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.337" offset="3928691">For example is one which ought to weigh in the balance of whether or not it ought to estopp the follow -- the subsequent party.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.345" offset="3972786">For example, Mr. Justice Stevens, in the relatively few cases compared to the much writing and comment on this subject, cited in respondent's brief are the application of offensive so-called use of estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.116" offset="4039868">I find only three in which offensive use was actually applied, and I find there that in each of those three cases the party in whose shoes, so to speak, the new litigant finds himself, was a party of exactly identical rank or interest, so to speak, in the litigation of that issue, as was the later party sought to be estopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.655" offset="4134013">For example, the three cases that I can recall are a co-passenger in a taxicab, both innocent, both victimized, a full and fair opportunity, a jury trial right in the first action, ergo, offensive estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.591" offset="4193782">I do not find -- apart from matters of legal analysis, my sense of justice isn't troubled by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.978" offset="4227323">A co-passenger in an airplane, a mortgagee versus a mortgager successively suing an insurance carrier arising out of the same casualty where the implication and the facts are strong that the litigant to the earlier case had the same kinds of concern, the same view of the litigation as could be presumed to be that of the party of the second litigation who was sought to be estopped.</text>

            <text syncTime="1219.670" offset="4982053">Let me tell you why I do because I think that distinction goes very much to the heart of the issue presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.003" offset="5007339">Beacon Theatres, which was interpreted in precisely contrary manners by the Fifth Circuit and the Seventh Circuit, Beacon Theatres said that, in the face of the federal rules which, in terms of the merger of law and equity, presented both what used to be equitable and legal disputes in the same civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.478" offset="5097305">The Seventh Amendment, with its command to continue to preserve jury trial rights in the sense that they had been entitled to preservation historically and in accordance with the long line of this Court's cases, compelled that any issues of fact in what would otherwise be a mixed, legal, and equitable case under the federal rules, must needs be tried by a jury and that to try such issues of fact before an Equity Court would violate the mandate of the Seventh Amendment and the constitutional right of a litigant to it advanced the traditional common law claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.406" offset="5256965">And, for that reason, Your Honor, and I hope I'm being responsive to your question, for that reason, I would say to you that in the law under Beacon Theatres, under Dairy Queen, and under Meeker against Ambassador Oil, all cited and discussed in the brief, the law is clear that where there are issues of fact which are in aid of equitable claims and of legal claims, you may not extinguish the jury right created by those legal claims by a prior adjudication in equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.056" offset="5403564">That's the fair and, I believe, the inevitable interpretation of Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.177" offset="5428120">And, I might say in that connection that the Second Circuit found a rather unusually narrow interpretation of Beacon Theatres.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.166" offset="5464064">It said in substance, and I hope I'm not exaggerating for the purpose of illuminating the Second Circuit's view, it said in substance Beacon Theatres was merely a scheduling case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.924" offset="5511084">It concerned itself with how issues ought to be ordered and that's why it came up in a mandamus context so that the District Court would have the proper direction and both the rational Court in the Fifth Circuit and, I believe, the plaintiff's kind of reading of Justice Black's opinion for the majority don't at all admit of that narrow construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.163" offset="5612022">To us and to the Fifth Circuit, it was a very ringing affirmation of Seventh Amendment rights when confronted by the new structure of litigation posed by the federal rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="1407.214" offset="5732185">With the greatest respect, Mr. Justice Stewart, let me tell you why I think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.392" offset="5752978">I think not because there is one sentence in Justice Black's decision for the majority which at least the Second Circuit turned to or it was the only one, at least that we could find, which could be argued to have supported the proposition that it ordered pre-litigation of jury issues as a-- one-half of a two-sided coin of permitting estoppel if the order which the Supreme Court mandated were not followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.713" offset="5894248">Justice Black made one comment in Beacon Theatres, and that was in the context of characterizing the Circuit Court below's concerns, as expressed b the Circuit Court, and Justice Black characterized it, at least in substance, by saying there is some concern expressed that if the equitable issues were tried first, why, then an estoppel might follow of the legal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.648" offset="5993932">But, Mr. Justice Stewart, I wold sggest to you that our reading of Meeker against Ambassador Oil leads us to conclude that the intention of Beacon Theatres was rather broader than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.126" offset="6051924">In Meeker, there was no mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.173" offset="6064044">The District Court did not get the benefit of early warning about the order in which the Seventh Amendment preferred the issues to be tried and the District Court, without the benefit of that, went ahead where both legal and equitable relief was granted and ordered the equitable issues tried first before a Court and without a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.306" offset="6156622">They were tried first, adversely to the jury claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.354" offset="6176789">The District Court found that, in consequence, there was nothing to decide in the legal action because it was dependent on the premise of fact which was inherent to the equitable action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.644" offset="6217958">The case came to the United States Supreme Court, I believe, in 1963, and this Court reversed memorandum, decision reversed citing Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen, remanded the case, and our inquiry tells us, as is revealed in the brief, that the case went back and it was directed to be retrial -- retried with the jury issues tried first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.314" offset="6316596">The order not which by mandamus reflects a preference of this Court but, with the greatest respect, the order which we believe Justice Black, for the majority in Beacon, directed that it be held and that the reciprocal consequence, far from being a permitted estoppel, is a retrial or an assertion of the Seventh Amendment mandate by a new trial so that the Seventh Amendment, not by happenstance of a Court's improper ordering of issues, be vitiated or be lost in the bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.463" offset="6469256">And, to that issue also, Justice Black in Beacon Theatres, the case argued to be limited merely to a scheduling of cases, stated a jury right cannot, through prior determination of equitable claims-- a jury right, forgive me, cannot be lost through prior determination of equitable claims except under the most imperative circumstances which, in view, are flexible procedures of the federal rules, Justice Black couldn't even anticipate happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.781" offset="6622542">Now, relating these arguments and relating these fulcra interpretation of Beacon Theatres to the matter at hand, we argue, as precisely as the Fifth Circuit did found in Rachal, that what the Second Circuit here has done is a complete anomaly because in SEC injunctions, by statute, you cannot consolidate them with private cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.791" offset="6726510">Ergo, the issue cannot be presented to the Court in a precisely Beacon Theatres context, that is to say, consolidated cases presenting the question of the order of trial of legal and equitable issues, because these 1934 Exchange Act prohibits a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.840" offset="6798712">And, the Fifth Circuit in Rachal said “how is it possible that if these cases were consolidate for trial there is no way that the jury trial could have had to wait for the equitable trial or would've been bund by a result in an equitable trial?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.742" offset="6862346">It is anomalous, the Fifth Circuit found, that the party who was not in the original adjudication, the respondent in this case, could, in effect, get a benefit of a pre-litigation without jury that he could not have had if the case were presented in the eq -- in the Beacon Theatres' context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.456" offset="6957223">Any other interpretation, I think, would be -- would do the greatest offense to the Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen Doctrines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.986" offset="6991287">Now, Your Honors, we contend also and the briefs demonstrate the line of reasoning, I think, quite simply that the traditional line of inquiry of whether a Seventh Amendment right concededly hereto for existing can be vitiated or lost, and that is the standard historical inquiry about what the state of the law as to jury rights was in 1791, can be applied in this instance that the cases which are cited in the brief demonstrate the very simple sequence that there was no such thing as an estoppel which could have extinguished a jury trial right, not only in 1791 but until 25 or 30 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.963" offset="7227225">That, this action is an action within the protection of the Seventh Amendment cit -- on the authority of this Court's decisions, and that the introduction of a new procedural mechanism cannot be employed to vitiate that Seventh Amendment right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1827.941" offset="7415097">We respectfully submit that Beacon Theatres is precisely a scheduling question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.881" offset="7450937">The issue presented in Beacon Theatres is when the Court has before it both legal and equitable claims, it must have the jury decide the legal claims first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.128" offset="7507884">Otherwise, there would be a preclusive effect of the determination of the equitable claims by the Court which would make it impossible for those claims to be heard by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.206" offset="7552188">This is consistent with the common law in 1791 when the constitution -- when the Seventh Amendment was adopted, in that a decree in equity between two parties in 1791 was preclusive on a subsequent legal action between those two parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.513" offset="7641422">There is no anomaly in finding that the equitable action will preclude the re-litigation of the issues in a legal action.</text>
