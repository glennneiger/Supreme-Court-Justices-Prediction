            <text syncTime="65.821" offset="366634">Mr. Mukai, I think you can proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert L. Mukai</label>
            <text syncTime="68.481" offset="377292">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.027" offset="391502">The issue in this case is whether a state must provide commercial enterprises subject to it's state regulatory capacity, a hearing prior to obliging those enterprises to delay consummation of certain commercial expectancies pending a state inquiry in the regulatory interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.303" offset="468616">And this case arises from a partial summary judgment entered in the Central District of California, declaring facially void and enjoining enforcement of a Motor Vehicle Dealership Establishment and Relocation Act of the state, which I shall refer to as the California Automobile Franchise Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.562" offset="553671">The judgment of the three-judge court holds that the act deprives franchisors and their business associates of liberty and property without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.554" offset="605602">Now, Your Honors, with the Court’s permission, I propose to focus my remarks principally upon the basic reason that we contend the District Court ought not to decided this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.405" offset="653040">And further, I propose, with the Court's permission, to defer to counsel for appellants in Number 849, the discussion of the alternative grounds for affirmance which have been urged by the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.217" offset="704240">I'd like to spend a few moments with the statute in question, that statute in Section 3062 of the California Vehicle Code provides that in the event that a franchisor seeks to establish or relocate a dealership within 10 miles of one of its existing dealerships, then the franchisor must first notify the New Motor Vehicle Board of the State, an administrative agency, and each of the franchisors’ existing franchisees in the same line-make, within 10 miles of the prospective dealership site.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.000" offset="843421">Any franchisee, so notified, who is located within 10 miles of the proposed site may then file a protest with the New Motor Vehicle Board within 15 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.858" offset="890755">When a protest has been filed, the franchisor is prohibited from effectuating the proposed establishment or relocation until a hearing has been held by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.979" offset="935267">The California Vehicle Code Section 3062 implements this prohibition by requiring the Board, upon the receipt of a protest, to notify the franchisor first that a timely protest has in fact been filed, second, that a hearing is required to be held by the Board and third, that the franchisor shall not establish or relocate the proposed dealership until such time as the requisite hearing has been held, nor following the hearing if the Board should determine that cause exists not to permit the dealership.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.698" offset="1070164">And the Board notifications that were issued to General Motors franchising divisions in this case are found at pages 52 and 80 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.703" offset="1110183">I should add that the Act does require a full evidentiary hearing within 60 days after a notice of hearing has been issued by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.455" offset="1153233">And as the District Court itself noted, if the Board itself hears the protest, it must issue its decision within 30 days after holding the hearing or else the franchisor’s proposed action for establishment or relocation is deemed approved by law.</text>

            <text syncTime="485.237" offset="2044322">Your Honors, the District Court interpreted the Act as requiring the Board to set a hearing date concurrent with its issuance of the statutory notification to the franchisor.</text>

            <text syncTime="506.315" offset="2128645">The Court held that the Act's failure to provide a hearing before imposing any delay or to require a hearing soon thereafter constituted a deprivation of liberty on property without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.095" offset="2187786">In the District Court, we cited the Chief Justice’s dissenting opinion in the 1971 case of Wisconsin versus Constantino.</text>

            <text syncTime="532.308" offset="2232613">That is exactly what Judge Ely said to me Your Honor, but we cited it because we believe that that dissent which was concurred in by Mr. Justice Blackmun, has now become the role for application of Pullman abstention through this Court's more recent decisions in Harris County Commissioner's Court against Moore decided in 1975 and the 1976 decision in Bellotti against Baird which was decided unanimously by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.319" offset="2332609">And that rule we submit is that the Pullman doctrine applies even to an unambiguous statute which appears to be in conflict with accepted notions of due process if it is susceptible of a state court ruling which would either avoid a necessity of a federal constitutional decision or in the alternative substantially modify the federal issue involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.448" offset="2425187">In the present case entirely apart from the suggestion that the California Court could invalidate the Act under the State Constitution, we have submitted that this statute is susceptible of at least two constructions, one of which would avoid Federal constitutional issue and the other of which would substantially modify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.917" offset="2507003">First, as was the case in Constantino, this Act could be construed to require a hearing before a state action occurs at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.389" offset="2536887">This California precedent for such a situation we've cited to the Court, the case of Endler against Schutzbank involving a real estate commissioner's case in California and Rios versus Cousins heard in this Court’s sub nom, Department to Motor Vehicles against Rios.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.607" offset="2597804">Appellees point out in their brief that we have never affirmatively advocated this construction and of course this is true because we do not believe that the Act interferes with the liberty or a property interest and because we do not believe that due process requires a prior hearing even if some such interest is involve in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="681.332" offset="2828727">That is my understanding, Your Honor, and that's why I feel that it's important that I bring at least one ambiguity to this Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.746" offset="2858402">And that is the second interpretation which we have advocated affirmatively and it's the interpretation of which would substantially modify the due process issue dealt with by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.168" offset="2900093">That interpretation would hold that the Act requires the manufacturer to provide notice to the Board and to its franchisees before its commitment to its plans has advanced so far that the manufacturer simply cannot bear the delays of state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.574" offset="2965713">This interpretation focuses on the first words of Vehicle Code Section 3062 which is the crux of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.325" offset="2992671">Those words are, “In the event that a franchisor seeks to enter into a franchise, establishing an additional dealership or relocating an existing dealership.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.176" offset="3040110">The interpretation which we have advocated would settle the time related ambiguity of these first words present and the necessity of such an interpretation is demonstrated by the facts that the Fox enfranchisement and the Muller relocation in this very case, presented situations where in neither case did General Motors’ notice of intent precede finalization of its plans with those dealers and in both cases, General Motors waited to give notice until after it had already entered into the franchises with its respective dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.922" offset="3179081">In fact, in the case of Fox, General Motors didn’t give notice at all until some three months after the franchise became effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.513" offset="3213458">Now, appellee's due process claim rests at least in part on the assertion of a protected property right by virtue of contractual arrangements regarding its franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.005" offset="3251388">If a state court were to interpret this section to require the manufacturer to issue its notice at sometime, before these contractual arrangements are made and finalized, then there could be no basis whatsoever for the due process claim predicated on the existence of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.359" offset="3316799">In addition, if some liberty or property interest is implicated by this statute, the determinants of what process is due would be completely different because of the nature of the so-called right that is being interfered with, because in that situation --</text>

            <text syncTime="874.339" offset="3600697">Mr. Justice Stewart has accurately stated our position in reference to the abstention issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.553" offset="3617625">It is the position of the dealer association appellants here that abstention of the Pullman variety is an equitable doctrine at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.671" offset="3654092">It serves no useful purpose to say that District Court should have abstained.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.763" offset="3670392">I would like to pass momentarily to the due process clause attack which was brought on the statute and which was the specific ground on which the District Court held that the statute was facially invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.139" offset="3719920">It is our position that there is no conceivable liberty or property interest which can be made out by General Motors or the other appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.875" offset="3754924">The long and short of it is that they assert the right to establish an automobile franchise or to become a franchise dealer whenever they want and wherever they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.851" offset="3794735">And we submit that this is not the type of liberty or property concept which has been given due process procedural protection by this Court, ever.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.354" offset="3848756">One other point in reference to the due process clause, and that is that the appellees in their brief have stated that if the due process procedural protections are not available to General Motors in Fox and Muller, in this situation, then they have no protection whatsoever under the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.057" offset="3931617">That seems to be a statement which is hard to sustain.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.566" offset="3949589">Clearly, there's a notion of substantive due process in the sense that all state regulation of economic enterprises as well as other enterprises and other activity must be rationally related to a legitimate end of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.525" offset="4013432">Clearly, we submit and we have submitted this in our reply brief, this kind of legislation is indeed rationally related to illegitimate end of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.952" offset="4051153">The Automobile Dealers’ Day in Court Act on the federal level is an express recognition by Congress of the inadequate status at the bargaining table, if you will, which dealers have when they bargain with automobile manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.060" offset="4115623">The problem of overloading in terms of putting in too many dealerships in the same line-make in one marketing area has brought a number of states other than California to the same position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.344" offset="4168704">In other words, some form of legislation which limits the Carte Blanche authority of the manufacturer to establish a new or additional dealership in a given market area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.105" offset="4215829">19 states have statutes which are similar to California in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.723" offset="4234219">11 of these states of these 19, have a Board or an official state body that passes upon or supervises or looks over in some way this decision by the manufacturer to put in an additional dealership in an area already served by a dealer carrying the same line-make.</text>

            <text syncTime="1093.395" offset="4476949">That would appear to be a recognition by the commercial entities involved of the need for some kind of regulation of this activity and clearly, Congress and the other state legislatures have felt the same way, other state legislatures beside California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.366" offset="4540792">I would like to pass to the supremacy clause argument which is made by General Motors in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.993" offset="4563362">It was not the ground on which Judges Ely and Gray and Takashi relied down below, but it was urged to the to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.874" offset="4606830">As I take it, the supremacy clause argument here is that since the California Act, Automobile Franchisers Act imposes some limitation upon the total freedom of General Motors to put a dealership in wherever and whenever they want to, that this somehow conflicts with the central policy of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.567" offset="4697631">Now, at the present time, I know of no case and I certainly would stand corrected on this, where this Court has voided a state statute on the grounds that it conflicts with the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.306" offset="4748622">This Court has voided activities of price fixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.526" offset="4777462">Attorneys have said that monopolistic practices on the part of utilities are municipally owned and otherwise are subject to the anti-trust laws, but it is not struck down as state statute on the ground that it conflicted with anti-trust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.196" offset="4848201">The California Supreme Court has struck down its liquor fair pricing law recently in a case which is cited in our reply brief but as far as I know with this Court has not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.230" offset="4900342">I would make so bold as to partially that there would have to be two steps in any such analysis which would have to undergone before a state statute could be struck down on the ground that it “violates the Sherman Act or violates the central policy of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.937" offset="4967111">First, it would seem to me, it would have to be shown that the state statute authorizes conduct which -- but for the state statute would violate the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.840" offset="5006712">And secondly, that the statute authorizes conduct which is not “state action” as that phrase is come to be defined in a number of decision which this Court has rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.569" offset="5053628">Obviously, state action itself cannot be illegal under the Sherman Act and that dates from Parker versus Brown and that is a concept never questioned by this Court subsequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.951" offset="5095215">So, what we're talking about here is an attack on the only private conduct which is really authorized by this Act and that is the right of a dealer to protest to this Board, that is the only conduct undertaken by private party.</text>
