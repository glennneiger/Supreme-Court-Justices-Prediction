            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="8.035" offset="32078">Well, this is a federal income tax case and it comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.899" offset="63530">That Court has had the United States' Tax Court before it decided the issues in favor of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and against the corporate taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.271" offset="108983">There are two issues involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.173" offset="116611">One has to do with the amount of an addition by an accrual basis taxpayer to a reserve or bad debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.200" offset="152764">And the other concerns inventory write-downs when the taxpayer concludes that its inventory is excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.934" offset="183693">These obviously are not issues of such public interest as to merit extended comment here but they are of definite concern to accountants and to those who administer the income tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.156" offset="236565">It will suffice to say that in an opinion filed today the Court unanimously affirms the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.998" offset="271987">We hold that the Commissioner did not abuse his discretion when he ruled that the inventory write-down effectuated by the taxpayer did not reflect income clearly for income tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.577" offset="326217">And also that he did not abuse his discretion when he disallowed in part the taxpayer's addition to its bad debt reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.215" offset="360803">In reaching these conclusions we emphasize that what may be appropriate for accounting purposes does not necessarily govern for income tax purposes.</text>
