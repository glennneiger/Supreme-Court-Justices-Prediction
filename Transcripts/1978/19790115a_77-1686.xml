            <text syncTime="46.011" offset="287431">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.611" offset="297775">The issue in this case is whether Congress reserved rights of way across some 34 million acres of land that were patented in support of the transcontinental railroad construction under the Union Pacific Act of 1862.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.676" offset="390040">The Act is very straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.864" offset="398817">Section 3 makes a grant of every alternate section of public land designated by odd numbers to the amount of five alternate sections per mile on each side of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.397" offset="456913">This number was amended two years later to increase it to ten.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.623" offset="477915">The purpose is stated in Section 3 as aiding in the construction of said railroad and telegraph line and to secure the safe and speed transportation of the male troops, munitions of war in public stores thereon.Congress made three categories of exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.456" offset="569240">First is provided for an exception for land sold, reserved or otherwise disposed off by the United States prior to the fixing of the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.579" offset="617723">Secondly, it exempted or it excepted mineral lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.613" offset="633814">And third, it excluded or required a reversion of lands not sold or disposed off within three years after the completion of the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.220" offset="676237">It contain no exceptions or reservations of any kind for rights of way across the lands granted and this is not an issue or in dispute in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.656" offset="722004">Section 4 then directed that after acceptance of each 40 miles of line constructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.749" offset="754395">Patent shall issue conveying the right and title of said lands to the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.979" offset="787310">And it provides no qualification with respect to the right or title of lands that are conveyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.908" offset="823045">Petitioners in this case are successors and enters to the railroad grants of Section 3 lands on the east side of Seminoe Reservoir in the State of Wyoming and have grants under Section 4 without reservation of any kind in the patents for crossing.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.526" offset="925445">Petitioners also hold the alternate, even-numbered sections under grazing license pursuant to the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.062" offset="971630">The controversy in this case arose in December of 1973, when officers and agents of the Department of Interior commenced constructing a road from a public highway westerly to the eastern shore of Seminoe Reservoir across public domain sections and the alternating checkerboard lands of petitioner's patent that under the 1862 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.008" offset="1123453">They did this without consent of the landowners without payment of any compensation or fencing on the road for the protection of the lands crossed.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.806" offset="1162637">Petitioners filed an action to quiet title against this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.839" offset="1182699">The parties stipulated as to the facts and submitted the matter to the Federal District Court in Wyoming for --on cross motions of summary judgment on the title issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.134" offset="1235884">The District Court quieted title in the plaintiffs concluding that were no rights of way reserved either expressly or by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.285" offset="1284472">Secondly, that the --no rights of way by necessity could be implied in the favor of the sovereign since the sovereign has the power of eminent domain to take such ways as it needs all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.697" offset="1354167">And the Court further found that for 110 years after the grant of the fee lands to the Union Pacific Railroad Company, neither the Department of the Interior nor any other agency or agent of the United States construed the grant or the patents issued pursuant thereto as conferring any right upon the United States as agents or the public to traverse the lands granted to the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.831" offset="1470673">On appeal to the Tenth Circuit Court that decision was reversed, Court of Appeals finding that there was a right of way reserved by implication saying, “To hold to the contrary would be to ascribe to Congress the degree of carelessness or lack of foresight which in our view would be unwarranted”.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.351" offset="1592822">Petitioner submit that the decision of this Court of Appeals should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.680" offset="1626049">The decision of the trial court affirmed for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.075" offset="1647679">The first and foremost being that the Court of Appeals presumed an intent that was not expressed anywhere by Congress in the legislative history or in the debates or in the language of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.157" offset="1716015">The Court of Appeals considered no administrative experience under the Act in 110 years of patenting of lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="462.822" offset="1954670">Congress started back in 1827, according to the legislative history, in providing support for public improvements by contributing the proceeds from the sale of public lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.159" offset="2012035">It did this for canals, it did it for highways and it did it starting in 1850 for railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.672" offset="2042023">The idea was that it would give the proceeds of sale to an enterprise that was providing a public improvement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1340.015" offset="5463437">That the three-judge dissenting opinion in Platte is I think very helpful in getting this whole matter in focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.742" offset="5510353">This was a Court speaking at the time when congressional intent was still fresh efore in everybody's mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.057" offset="5543581">The majority in Platte allowed the railroads to hold this acreage on the theory that the mortgaging was a disposition so that within the three years after completion of the road, the railroad didn't have to either settled it or give it back for entry under the homestead or preemption laws, it could held it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.617" offset="5641801">The dissent in Platte said, "This is not what Congress ever intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.161" offset="5664057">Congress intended these lands to be settled and that the railroads would not be able to hold them by mortgage.It could not hold this land locked checkerboard patterned".</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.803" offset="5710555">And had the will of Congress been carried out without the mortgaging process, we wouldn't have these problems today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.365" offset="5744828">But the fact remains the lands were patented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.519" offset="5769488">There was no reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.969" offset="5779205">The legislative history would affirmed the fact that there was no intent on the part of Congress to make such reservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1458.820" offset="5938657">Buford said, “No private landowner can enjoin or recovery trespass damage for the crossing of unfenced open lands associated with the public domain”.</text>
