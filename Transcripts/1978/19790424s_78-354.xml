            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">I also have another announcement this morning that I'm authorized to make on behalf of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.175" offset="52663">This is the case of North Carolina against Butler here on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.043" offset="88085">In conflict with the view of every other court that has considered the issue, the North Carolina Supreme Court has held in this case that under this Courtâ€™s decision in Miranda against Arizona, no statement of a person under custodial interrogation may be admitted in evidence against him unless at the time the statement was made, he explicitly waived the right to the presence of a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.067" offset="208248">We granted certiorari to consider whether this per se rule reflects a proper understanding of the Miranda decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.691" offset="250671">For the reasons set out in an opinion of the Court filed today, the judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to North Carolina Supreme Court for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.849" offset="295393">Mr. Justice Blackmun while joining the Court opinion has filed a concurring statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.599" offset="318380">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion which Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice Stevens have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.848" offset="347324">Mr. Justice Powell took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
