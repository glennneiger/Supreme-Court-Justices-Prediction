            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll hear arguments next in Federal Communications Commission against Midwest Video and the consolidated cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.589" offset="389726">Mr. Wallace, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="76.671" offset="410102">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.472" offset="429223">This case presents statutory and constitutional challenges under the First and Fifth Amendments to three related sets of rules of the Federal Communications Commission relating to the cable television requiring certain defined cable systems in one rule to have the capacity by 1986 to provide at least 20 channels of service to their subscribers, in another rule to provide access to certain of those channels if demand exists access to third parties and if there is sufficient activated channel capacity and in the third set of rules to have available and make available certain equipment and facilities to those parties for those purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.853" offset="678745">I will summarize briefly the rules and then discuss later pertinent details as they relate to portions of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.870" offset="730885">The channel capacity rules are really adequately summarizing what I said already that by 1986, 20 channels should be available to their subscribers.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.218" offset="792221">The access rules apply to four categories of third parties who will have access to the extent there is available capacity for their access.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.510" offset="865364">The public, educational authorities, local governments and paying leasors for those systems that were already in operation by June 21, 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.299" offset="948537">There is basically no obligation to bump any established programming other than automated time and weather service, which is a sort of ticker tape kind of informational programming, for systems constructed thereafter or for new capacity that's added to existing systems there is requirement that at least one channel be available for access by these groups, but to the extent that demand doesn't require more than one channel it can be a composite channel for access.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.391" offset="1128887">The third category of rules the equipment availability rules are basically designed to see to whether the equipment is there so that the people with the access rights will have some way of coming into the studio and having their programming broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.512" offset="1209448">The Court of Appeals treated the rules together rather than separately and struck down all of them under the Act, but also expressed the view quite firmly that the rules would in any event violate the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.273" offset="1296488">So then in our view if the Court agrees with our contentions that the rules are authorized by the Act, it should go ahead and address the constitutional issues since a remand, the result of a remand will be foreordained in the case and it is -- the statutory question should not really be considered in isolation in the constitutional contentions in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.867" offset="1402859">Now more than 10 years ago in United States against Southwestern Cable Company, this Court established that Section 2 (a) of the Communications Act does confer jurisdiction on the Commission over cable television.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="343.541" offset="1477569">Just before you go back just a moment, Mr. Wallace, why do you suppose the Court of Appeals addressed the constitutional question if you found that what the Commission did was not authorized by the Act?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="359.431" stopTime="389.515">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="359.431" offset="1541099">Well, as Judge Webster pointed out in this concurring opinion there was no need to do so but two of the judges choose to do so and the questions were argued to the Court and perhaps it was to make clear what would happen if this Court should disagree with the Court of Appeals on the statutory issue as it did in the last Midwest Video case disagreed with the same Court of Appeals' interpretation of the Commission's statutory jurisdiction.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="394.263" offset="1680384">Well, they refrain from calling it an alternative holding but they made quite clear their view that the rules would violate the First Amendment and suggested strongly that they would violate the Fifth Amendment as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.447" offset="1737122">They did refrain from stating explicitly it was an alternative holding in fact they stated that their holding was based entirely on the statutory ground.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="431.304" offset="1828551">And because of constitutional difficulties one feels impelled of construe a statute to certain way?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="437.280" stopTime="529.073">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="437.280" offset="1852479">It's really hard for me to answer that question I don't think the opinion is all that clear on the extent to which the constitutional view influenced the statutory holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.325" offset="1908694">I can't really speak for the Court on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.485" offset="1941295">In any event the Southwestern case thus established the basic statutory authority on the face of the Act at least so long as the regulations adopted by the Commission are as this Court put it reasonably ancillary to its jurisdiction over broadcasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.282" offset="2024469">Then almost seven years ago now, in what we refer to as Midwest Video I in the briefs, this Court held that, that statutory authority extends to rules requiring cable systems and to put the holding in somewhat generic terms used by the plurality opinion to rules requiring the systems affirmatively to promote the statutory policies of the Act such as increasing outlets for community expression and providing more programming choices for the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.013" offset="2207431">Now to a large extent --</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="529.073" offset="2219656">It is difficult to describe that as a holding, is it not, in view of the fact of the Chief Justice's concurrence in the result?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="537.402" offset="2252988">Yes, but there was a judgment of the Court, there was a holding that those rules were valid.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="542.983" stopTime="548.713">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="542.983" offset="2275349">But the reasoning for upholding, I mean it cannot really be attributed to the Court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="548.713" stopTime="678.758">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="548.713" offset="2298232">Well, I understand, but on the other hand there was no disagreement in any of the opinions with that proposition and this is I think an accurate, generic categorization of the rules that were issued before the Court and it was the Commission's own description of the rules on the basis for its authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.845" offset="2394781">Now I grant that there is no opinion of the Court and we are quite aware of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.267" offset="2420485">Nonetheless in Midwest Video I, the Court had before it many similar questions to the statutory questions that are now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.228" offset="2480253">The rules there did have an equipment availability component that really is basically the same as the present equipment availability rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.447" offset="2533125">It was put there as part of the -- and it is referred to explicitly by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.299" offset="2560606">It was part of the origination of the programming requirement and the Court was ruling against the background of the rules that had been involved in the Southwestern Cable Company case in which a plurality of the court against said had been correctly upheld subsequently by several Courts of Appeals namely rules that required certain signal carriage, mandatory access if you want to use that word, mandatory carriage is usually used in that context, of local television programmings by the cable systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.883" offset="2738866">We are talking the access component in the sense that mandatory carriage is something that's been familiar since the beginning, since the outset of the Commission's regulation of cable television and was precisely what was before the Court in Southwestern Cable.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="678.758" stopTime="685.934">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="678.758" offset="2818382">Well, you are saying that the mandatory access was necessary to the decision of the Court in Southwest cable?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="685.934" stopTime="872.833">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="685.934" offset="2847117">No, the Court merely held that the Commission had jurisdiction to promulgate rules on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.968" offset="2867284">It did not uphold the validity of the rules, but subsequent Court of Appeals decisions did and four justices in the plurality opinion in Midwest Video said that those cases were correctly decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.075" offset="2927679">That was and still, you know that regulation still exists, but that was the beginning of Commission regulation more than ten years ago now.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.968" offset="2967280">In 1966 of cable television it was to require that local broadcast programs be carried on the cable and to prohibit duplication of network programming carried by local stations from distant signal stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.214" offset="3036244">That was that the first thing that the Commission did in this field was to prescribe certain carriage requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.050" offset="3071561">Now it wasn't accessed by the public, it was accessed by broadcasters, but the word access is not inappropriate in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.694" offset="3106147">Moreover it was quite clear to this Court in Midwest Video I that the origination requirement and the equipment availability requirements before the Court at that time were tied in with rules than being developed and which had been adopted by the Commission prior to this Court's decision in Midwest Video that would grant rights of access to this equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.973" offset="3227251">And they also adopted channel capacity rules along with those prior to this Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.430" offset="3253060">All of that was made quite clear to the Court and as a matter of fact the discussions during the argument in that case were of that kind of programming that was foreseen and there is several references in the plurality opinion backgrounding these rules which make this quite clear on page 653 of Volume 406 US in footnote 5, the plurality opinion quotes the Commission as saying one of the purposes of the origination requirement is to ensure that cable casting equipment will be available for use by others originating on common carrier channels.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.830" offset="3430693">On the next page, page 654 there is also a quotation with approval from tentative conclusions of earlier notice of rule making that these the proposed rules also reflect our view, this is quoting the Commission that a multi-purpose CATV operation combining carriage of broadcast signals with program origination and common carrier services might best exploit cable channel capacity to the advantage of the public and promote the basic purpose for which this Commission was created.</text>

            <text syncTime="872.833" offset="3594742">Mr. Wallace, did you think in this case these rules you are describing that the Commission is imposed on cable telecasters would be permissible for it to impose on broadcasters?</text>

            <text syncTime="884.273" offset="3640508">Well, the Court suggested in The Democratic National Committee case, CBS against The Democratic National Committee that narrowly defined access requirements might be valid in broadcasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.383" offset="3704874">There is no practical way that these rules could be imposed on broadcasting because of the different physical constrains that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.057" offset="3743640">A cable caster has simultaneous cables running to its subscribers and can do his own programming on the great majority of them while still complying with these rules whereas the broadcaster only has the one frequency assigned to him into the extent that he is required to permit anyone else to have the access to it, he relinquishes his opportunity to broadcast it all --</text>

            <text syncTime="935.456" offset="3845204">Why could not the Commission just say you broadcast for ten hours a day and let other people broadcast it for four hours a day?</text>

            <text syncTime="940.224" offset="3864221">Well, that would be an analogous requirement, but it wouldn't be the same requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.596" offset="3889716">You are asking me if they could impose the same requirement and my answer was that it couldn't practically be done, it couldn't be done as a practical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.870" offset="3918869">It would have to be a requirement adapted to the special physical situation of broadcasters and the Commission has been concerned about the fact that it requires interruption of the broadcaster's right to be on the air at all if such a requirement is imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.231" offset="4012283">In contrast what was adopted here which was basically a requirement that unused capacity be put to this kind of community use and that in rebuilding that would normally take place during the next ten-year period, a new building sufficient capacity to be built-in so that there would be basically this kind of access capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.894" offset="4122937">Granted a cable television operator might argue that he would prefer to put it to some different use at sometime in the future but we are not talking about disruption of established programming services or established pay services.</text>

            <text syncTime="1359.258" offset="5540446">If the public access channel is not sufficient to take care of the domain for public access materials, how does the cable television company decide which applicant to satisfy, is there any regulation on that or is it first come first serve, do they exercise editorial judgment?</text>

            <text syncTime="1376.050" offset="5607528">The regulation says that the cable company should adopt procedures, rules for itself to show how it will handle request on first come first serve basis, so this anticipates that people don't have to be given the particular time slot that they request that scheduling can be done to use the capacity that blackout time can be used on other channels when time is available and so forth and if the domain gets large enough and there is available a second channels and that two should be made available up to four channels if they are available, but the experience so far has been that a composite channel pretty much is able to cover it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.506" offset="5809403">There are as the Commission indicated, quite explicitly in these rules, the details to the worked out refinements to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.372" offset="5848900">This is a very dynamic field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.993" offset="5863320">The Commission has been giving its sustained attention now for more than 10 years has changed direction considerably since the last time we were in this Court with respect to cable rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.752" offset="5910340">It gave up the origination requirement in response to commentaries and experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.333" offset="5936671">It concluded that, that would be unduly burdensome on systems that did not want to themselves undertake to originate programming and is really using the access requirement largely as a substitution to serve the same kinds of community purposes and needs that the origination requirement was designed for and its cutback a great deal on the timetable for the channel capacity, your requirements and on the extent to which channels have to be made available for access.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.232" offset="6080345">The basic differences between the rules that existed in 1972 at the time of Midwest I, not all of which were before the Court, and the present rules is that the burdens on the cable systems have been alleviated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.642" offset="6141889">The changes basically were designed to alleviate burdens that were imposed and the main burden that was imposed was the origination rule and it was the burden of having to become a programmer and to produce your own programming which these people had not necessarily undertaken to do in setting up what basically started as community antennae television systems that the four dissenting Justices in Midwest I found objectionable in that case and found to extend beyond the Commissions proper regulatory authority to commandeer someone who had undertaken merely to carry the products of others into producing his own products and transmitting them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.646" offset="6354004">And the Commission's new rules really need that objection by coming back for those who choose not to get into the business of producing their own programs just to stay with their familiar business of carrying the products of others.</text>

            <text syncTime="1655.244" offset="6724315">In light of before getting to the legal arguments that I would like to make I would like to take a few minutes to discuss some of the specifics of the rules and their impact on cable systems because Midwest Video's perception of how those rules affect it is quite different from that described by Mr. Wallace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.217" offset="6824208">It is true that commencing on the effective date of the rules cable systems are required to dedicate one full channel to use by the public for educational governmental public and leased-access users.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.022" offset="6891499">This requirement alone involves generally one-twelfth to one-twentieth of the assets of the company and we do not regard that as an insubstantial requirement, but the rules actually require much more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.592" offset="6949700">The rules themselves specify that four separate dedicated access channels will be provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.019" offset="6979480">It's under a qualification to the rule which indicates that if there is not immediate demand for all four of those channels then cable systems may until the demand develops combine different types of access programming on one channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.442" offset="7041128">Now what type of demand requires the activation of another channel?</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.307" offset="7060564">It's a very minimal type of demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.028" offset="7067460">The rule specifies that cable system must activate on additional access channel if existing channels are in use during 80% of the weekdays Monday through Friday for 80% of the time during any consecutive three hour stretch for six weeks, six consecutive weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.438" offset="7141125">If you apply a little mathematics to that what it means is that less than two and a half hours of access used per day on a cable channel four days a week for six weeks requires the activation on additional access channel if the system has the activated channel capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.897" offset="7218970">So while there are demand usage requirements all of the momentum of the rules is to encourage the implementation of more and more channels as only minimal usage requirements are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.928" offset="7287097">And those requirements don't end when four channels are activated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.338" offset="7304756">They continue ad infinitum as I said before up to the activated channel capacity of the cable system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1829.363" offset="7420844">In order to add new channels your cable system has to -- most cable systems have essentially twelve channels, at least twelve channels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.690" offset="7462118">To add additional channels the cable system has to do one or two things, he might be able to put in a converter which will take signals coming down the cable at frequencies the television set will not receive and convert them to frequencies the set will receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.294" offset="7532544">This will give him extra channels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.392" offset="7540903">He may have to replace his old cable which may not be able to carry more than 12 channels, other cable with larger capacity or he may string a second cable but basically channels are added in incremental blocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.188" offset="7604120">Initially a system will have 12 channels.</text>

            <text syncTime="1949.432" offset="7901080">That only takes cable systems up to a total of about somewhere between 20 and 30 channels.</text>

            <text syncTime="2014.496" offset="8161364">Moreover if public access users produce their own programs, cable systems cannot charge for the use of the playback equipment necessary, but offer the time of the system personnel required to operate the equipment even if the access user wishes to run the programs outside of the normal business hours of the cable system.</text>

            <text syncTime="2294.066" offset="9279613">And there are numerous types of programming of this kind that the access rules impair the ability of the cable operator to pick and choose between.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.502" offset="9325380">In fact the question arose when Mr. Wallace was speaking about whether cable systems ever edit any of these type of programming.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.819" offset="9354637">We've cited some language in our brief from the FCC's reporting order adopting Equal Employment Opportunity Rules where the FCC cites some examples of cable operators specifically doing some editing of the programming that's distributed to them and which they receive by satellite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.439" offset="9453171">I would like also to make it clear Mr. Wallace has indicated that there would be no bumping of programming if a cable system was presenting a certain type of programming and an access demand arose and there was no vacant channel for access, he is indicated there would no bumping.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.025" offset="9539480">I believe that's true for programs that were not carried prior to, or that were being carried prior to the effective date of these rules in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.872" offset="9574902">Much of the programming which I have been describing and which I described in our brief has become available to cable systems since 1976 and what the Commission says is that its our intention that established cable cast services provided by cable system operators will not be automatically displaced, but if there are conflicts between channels users we are prepared to consider each such situation individually on its merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.874" offset="9710843">This means that a cable system whose channels are full and the access channel demand arises has go to the FCC and the FCC then has to consider whether it is -- whether it would be the Madison Square Garden programming or religious programming delivered by satellite or whether it would be movies, the FCC has -- as a super program director and make a judgment about whether this access use is a more valuable use than the use that the cable operator has been making of the channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.523" offset="9857442">Well I think that this has given sufficient background as to some of the reasons why Midwest Video and other companies in the industry are concerned about these rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.033" offset="9907493">I would like to pass on for the moment now to the jurisdictional argument and why we think that these rules clearly do exceed the Commission's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.119" offset="9959842">I would like to also note that a question was raised earlier in the argument as to whether why the Eighth Circuit discussed constitutional issues and whether there was in the appendix on page 65 the Court specifically states that the First Amendment overturns another constitutional considerations present in the 1976 report are such as to reinforce our conclusions on the jurisdictional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.197" offset="10072168">I think it is traditional that Courts do at least, it's not unusual for Courts to look at constitutional issues because it may influence their views on the jurisdiction so that they may not be required to reach a constitutional decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.330" offset="10144684">By turning to the jurisdiction, this Court in both Midwest I and Southwestern held that the FCC has authority under Section 2 (a) of the Communications Act to regulate cable systems, no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.863" offset="10206856">It's not an issue, but Section 2 (a) in and off itself does not specify any objectives for which the FCC's regular authority regulatory authority can be exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.414" offset="10265057">2 (a) alone without reference to something in the Act, we believe would be an unlawful delegation like Congress to the FCC to legislate as it pleases and the rules before this Court in Midwest I the plurality opinion upheld the rules because it looked carefully at the statutory provisions and the goals which the Commission was attempting -- indicated it was seeking to implement in adopting the mandatory origination rules and it concluded that the mandatory origination rule met those goals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2665.968" offset="10767235">We think that rules now before this Court go far beyond anything that was contemplated in Midwest I.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.028" offset="10795447">We think so for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.110" offset="10807777">First of all the rules in Midwest I were not contrary to any established goal of broadcast regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.756" offset="10854379">The Court found that they met specified goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.319" offset="10872665">Here we find that we believe that this Court's opinion in CBS versus Democratic National Committee established the fact that preservation of the goals of private journalism and editorial control are fundamental to broadcast regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.400" offset="10941001">The Court pointed out that Congress specifically dealt with and firmly rejected the argument that broadcast facility should be opened on a non-selective basis to all persons wishing to talk about public issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.142" offset="10991992">In responding to arguments that the First Amendment required individual access to broadcast facilities, the Court referred to the erosion of journalistic discretion and the transfer of control over treatment of public issues for licensees who are accountable for broadcast performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.678" offset="11062105">The government's principle answer to this is that the access goals -- is that we are arguing about mutually inconsistent goals and that while it concedes that this goal of editorial control and discretion may exist, the Commission has selected other goals and its within the Commission's discretion to select and choose between goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.045" offset="11175581">We think that the answer to this is that in the very decisions which were reviewed by this Court in the CBS case in dealing with Section 3 (h) and its relationship to the goal of editorial judgment and control by broadcasters, the FCC itself did not treat this goal as one to be placed in the balance with other perhaps conflicting goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.325" offset="11264711">The FCC's opinion treated Section 3 (h) as a statutory prescription and the FCC held that broadcasters were not required to sell time to individuals or groups to comment on public issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.465" offset="11321240">It was this determination of the FCC that the Court upheld in the CBS case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.973" offset="11351228">So if that's the FCC's policy as opposed -- as applied to broadcasters and it's a statutory policy that the FCC regards as paramount, we have difficulty seeing how if the Commission must look to broadcast regulatory goals for its authority to regulate cable television, how it can jettison that goal as applied to cable systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.677" offset="11454046">We think this Court's decision in the CBS versus DNC case is also quite consistent with that approach, but there is another reason why we think that these rules far exceed the FCC's jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3503.267" offset="14116446">Well, that they have been treated as such in the history of regulation under the Communications Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.851" offset="14154794">Even if one would quarrel with the terminology, the factual point I want to make is that the rules apply only to cable systems which retransmit television broadcast signals so that basically what the Chief Justice had to say in his concurring opinion in Midwest Video I applies when he said, it has been elaborated more by himself in prior opinions and by others, but he said the essence of the matter is that when they, the cable systems interrupt the signal, it is a broadcast signal and put it to their own use for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.833" offset="14318738">They take on burdens, one of which is regulation by the Commission to serve the public interest goals that are specified in the Communications Act and that are the very same goals that were involved in the rules that were upheld by the Court's judgment in Midwest I.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.954" offset="14407137">There is no difference in the goals being served by the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.982" offset="14419257">There are substitute for those rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="3588.953" offset="14459173">Well, I think there would be because even in the instances of other kinds of programming that Mr. Shapiro referred to, programming beamed in from satellites, those are beamed on microwave transmissions that are regulated under Title II of the Communications Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.351" offset="14532733">There is a use of signals there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.543" offset="14545586">It's not signals from the television broadcast spectrum, but they are signals from the public airwaves that are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.645" offset="14589994">We are not dealing with the medium that is divorced in important aspects of its activities from the radio spectrum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.331" offset="14632730">Now, I would like to say a word about a Section 3 (h) which appears in full in the appendix to the Commission's petition on page 210.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.250" offset="14696364">It is Section 153 (h) of Title 47 and you will notice that all that is there, when you read it in context, is the definition Section of the Act defining who is a common carrier and it's by way of a caveat that just because someone engages in radio broadcasting it doesn't mean that he is a common carrier subject to all of the filing regulations and dedicating all of his facilities to common carriage in the rest of it that otherwise would follow from this definition, even if he did allow some others to use his facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.659" offset="14861981">Now to the extent that this expresses a policy that the Commission is to follow and that means that it utilizes in conducting its other regulatory activities, it certainly is far from an absolute prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.201" offset="14928227">It is merely something to be taken into account along with other policies expressed in the Act and it is entirely consistent with the suggestion made in this Court's opinion in CBS against Democratic National Committee that limited kinds of access obligations are consistent with the Communications Act and might be imposed on broadcasting if they were carefully drawn and concluded to be in the public interest by the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="3737.723" offset="15054242">That is an example and certainly there is no further limitation on cable television which is not even referred to in this Section 153 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.445" offset="15125191">Now, finally I would like to say that Congress has been very aware of the Commission's activities in this area in recent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.539" offset="15173569">As I say the Commission has been making a ten-year sustained effort not only as this reported regularly to Congress in annual reports and appropriations, hearings and the likes, but there has been recent legislative activity in Congress which shows a continuing awareness of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.648" offset="15249951">We have cited on page 34 of our brief in a footnote, a recent public law which specifically refers to cable operators those over whom the Commission has continuing jurisdiction and the law actually says that the forfeiture penalties of the Act to be applied not only for failure to comply with licenses as we quote there but also for failure to comply with the rules and the Senate committee report which is report number 95-580 of the 95th Congress first session refers to this Court's decisions in Southwestern Cable and Midwest 1, so that the admonitions of the Chief Justice's concurring opinion that Congress has been relying and keeping a watchful eye on the Commission's activities in this field and can be counted on step in if it disagrees with what the Commission is doing in its responses to the changing dynamics of this industry and as it gains experience in this filed are even more pertinent here after seven more years of experience and adjustment by the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="3868.267" offset="15576482">Mr. Wallace, you spoke quite glowingly on two occasions in your response of the Chief Justice's concurrence in Midwest Video.</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.315" offset="15624652">In his opinion in Columbia Broadcasting versus Democratic Committee at page 107 of 412, he refers to the fact that in the Act of 1934, Congress rejected a proposal that would have imposed a limited obligation on broadcasters to turn over their microphones to persons wishing to speak out on certain public issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.435" offset="15721096">If that cannot be required of broadcast, do you think it can nonetheless be required of cable broadcasters by the Commission?</text>

            <text syncTime="3914.449" offset="15761220">Well, I do not concede that it cannot be required of broadcasters because the very same opinion points out that limited access rules might be properly required of broadcasters notwithstanding that can be drawn from failure of Congress to enact an exclusive requirement, Congress nevertheless gave the Commission authority to further public interest goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.541" offset="15865501">The Congress specified in ways that should seem appropriate as experience with the industry develops and as needs become apparent that Congress was not at that point willing to anticipate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.346" offset="15916805">I do not think that anymore than that opinion internally indicates that the mere facts of that provision was not adopted at the outset meant that the Commission is without authority because the opinion says the contrary.</text>
