            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">The case is submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1.070" offset="109652">We'll hear arguments next in Payton against New York, and Riddick against New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.503" offset="303480">Mr. Hellerstein, I think you may proceed when you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_e_hellerstein" startTime="52.187" stopTime="245.992">
            <label>Mr. William E. Hellerstein</label>
            <text syncTime="52.187" offset="314138">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.883" offset="324901">These cases are before you on reargument.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.502" offset="335454">They are appeals from the New York Court of Appeals which by a vote of four-to-three sustained the constitutionality of New York's arrest statutes which allow, even in the absence of exigent circumstances, a warrantless entry into the home for the purposes of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.373" offset="402954">To briefly state the facts which I think in both cases are manifestations of the operations of the statute, that in real terms demonstrate the importance of the warrant requirement which I think this Court will require or should require.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.041" offset="465544">In the Payton case, you had a situation where on January 12, 1970 there was a homicide in the course of a robbery on an Upper East Side gas station in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.650" offset="512042">Two days later, the police -- the investigating police obtained information as to who they could believe was probable cause may have committed the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.460" offset="563242">That information led them that day to go to the premises -- to have the premises pointed out to them and to do nothing, to spend the rest of the afternoon, the entire evening, until 7:30 the next morning when in a substantially large group of detectives, they went to the premises, an apartment on the fifth floor in a building in the South Bronx -- in Manhattan, I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.919" offset="673061">And after trying to force the door open and unable to do so, called for assistance which arrived a half hour later and with the use of crowbars the door was forced open.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.377" offset="718932">Once the police entered the premises and they saw that Mr. Payton was not even there, they proceeded to ransack the apartment, seized a number of items which -- all of which was suppressed by the trial court on consent on the prosecution except for a 30 caliber cartridge that was found in plain view on top of a stereo set.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.187" offset="802210">The lower courts and the majority of the New York Court of Appeals, finding that the police were lawfully in the premises since they did not need a warrant, could have seized what they saw in plain view.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.437" offset="843170">The Riddick case is another -- more striking in some respects example of the essentiality of a warrant requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.173" offset="878070">In Riddick, the crime was committed four years prior to the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.032" offset="901580">The police have probable cause and could've known and could've gotten Mr. Riddick a long time before they went to his apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.572" offset="931673">They waited two months before they decided to arrest him in his apartment without a warrant, even though they knew his address.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.417" offset="967095">They went in, his three-year-old son answered the door, they entered, Mr. Riddick was sitting in his bed with some underwear on but naked to the waist, and he was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.805" offset="1012652">I think the entries in both of these cases are cardinal examples of why as I understand where this Court has gone so far with respect to warrants, the warrant requirement should and must be imposed with respect to entries in non-exigent circumstances into private premises.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="245.992" offset="1089348">Well, if the police, they'd had a warrant, that wouldn't have presented -- prevented them from arresting the latter respondent -- rather latter petitioner in his underwear, would it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_e_hellerstein" startTime="259.050" stopTime="297.689">
            <label>Mr. William E. Hellerstein</label>
            <text syncTime="259.050" offset="1141593">No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.370" offset="1146922">They -- they didn't arrest him in his underwear.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.657" offset="1156012">I mean, they let him get dressed to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.865" offset="1168865">I just -- the reason I emphasized factually underwear is we're talking about the home and these are -- this is the heart of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.573" offset="1203764">And in order to enter a home and to seize citizens in that context I think, as I understand the warrant requirement, it has always been to ensure that a magistrate has determined that before that type of entry is made the probable cause determination should be made by someone other than a police officer who has to make subjective judgments that are not always correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.014" offset="1393518">But people in the context of where their expectation of privacy is of the highest and we would draw no distinction with respect to motels and homes but the actual residence, and I think a motel room can be a home for -- the time and person who's there, but there would be no distinction.</text>

            <text syncTime="364.896" offset="1564985">In Payton, it was a multiple tenement, multiple dwelling tenement, fifth floor, apartment 5-A.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.394" offset="1594974">I've not seen the premises but I think it's a typical New York, Manhattan tenement.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.535" offset="1623604">In Riddick, it was a two-family private house in Queens.</text>

            <text syncTime="383.809" offset="1640636">Half a house.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.071" offset="1649727">The majority below approached the case along the lines that an entry to arrest was less intrusive than an entry to search.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.898" offset="1701031">That was its first premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.991" offset="1709390">Its second premise was that an arrest in the home is less embarrassing than an arrest in public and therefore this Court's concern in Watson was even less forceful.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.609" offset="1755888">I -- for reasons I'll state, I disagree with both.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.255" offset="1770412">And again, the Court of Appeals thought that the common law was very one-sided in terms of trying to ascertain the intent of the framers that it was one-sided, that the common law allowed entries.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.728" offset="1816283">I submit, I think in our brief extensively we come to quite an opposite conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.627" offset="1843973">So we think these assumptions were wrong, erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.078" offset="1857766">I think it's noteworthy that since the opinion of the Court of Appeals in this case, a number of courts, High Appellate Courts have refused to follow it, I think because it's a bitter pill for a lot of courts to follow, a warrantless entry of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.850" offset="1916803">And the Eighth Circuit has just recently, in the Houle case, which is in our supplemental brief, refused to allow warrantless entries and the High Courts of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania also refused to follow the Payton case as decided by the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.111" offset="1981900">There's some significance I think in at least the sensitivity of a number of courts both state and federal to the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.213" offset="2014292">Our basic line, basic view is that if one thing is clear about this Court's decision is -- is it that physical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the Fourth Amendment stands and that's what this case is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.142" offset="2073955">And the arrest warrant provides protection at the very least against that type of entry without a magistrate determination that on the facts known to the officer there is probable cause to believe a defendant has committed a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.989" offset="2141351">I think for us the logical starting point for our argument has to be the plurality opinion in the Coolidge case, where the Court said that the notion of a warrant was entry to arrest was per se at odds unreasonable in line of the Court's decisions and absent well-defined exigent circumstances there could be no warrantless entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.389" offset="2231003">And further than the Coolidge case, the Court said that Warden versus Hayden, which has come to be known as a "hot pursuit" type of case, stands by which negative implication that an arrest warrant is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.522" offset="2287532">These two statements of the plurality in Coolidge have led most if not all, but a substantial and predominant number of courts to read the language in Coolidge to come to a conclusion quite opposite that reached by the majority below.</text>

            <text syncTime="1244.958" offset="5085247">I -- I should point out that the Court has amended Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to provide for search warrants, not arrest warrants, when persons are being sought, without limiting it to third person premises.</text>

            <text syncTime="1266.819" offset="5172705">But furthermore, that if the Court had a desire to harmonize Rule 41 which at least you at times said implemented Fourth Amendment concerns, then the most sensible reconciliation of this difficult issue would be to require a search warrant so that Rule 41 would totally conform with what the Fourth Amendment requires, but I do not think it is necessary for this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.261" offset="5286494">The prosecution -- my adversary, Mr. Zimroth talks a great deal about the burdens to police if you impose either type of requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1318.592" offset="5379803">And you've rejected it many times because you placed the importance of that warrant requirement in our constitutional scheme in a very high level.</text>

            <text syncTime="1344.027" offset="5481576">If we start with the premise that we're talking non-exigent circumstances, then I can see no weight at all to Mr. Zimroth's argument that a warrant requirement imposed by this Court would be a burden to any legitimate concern of police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.977" offset="5557332">Because if it's not exigent, circumstances are not exigent, then the police have time to do a number of things.</text>

            <text syncTime="1728.670" offset="7020084">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.368" offset="7030847">Mr. Hellerstein is asking this Court to -- in a very drastic manner change the balance of accommodating interests that have been with us from the earliest of recorded history on this subject until relatively recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.817" offset="7104721">The accepted manner in which the lawfulness of an entry to a home to make an arrest for a felony was quite clear, and that is that the officers brought the defendant into custody and then the judicial system mobilized in a very substantial manner to test two things, first the factual predicate for the arrest, and, second, the manner of execution of the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.622" offset="7227914">This was a judgment of people who were very sensitive to the needs of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.082" offset="7249753">In fact these very same people created the protections that subsequently became the protections of the Fourth Amendment with respect to search warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.690" offset="7288205">And in fact, this system that I have outlined, if I may borrow the words of Mr. Justice Powell in the Gerstein against Pugh case, where he said there are indications that the framers of the Bill of Rights regarded it, meaning this system that I've just outlined, as the model of a reasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.857" offset="7392799">Mr. Hellerstein I think is simply incorrect when he says that there was a substantial dispute about this prior to the adoption of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.349" offset="7438775">There were many disputes about the manner in which the lawfulness of arrests were to be tested, but those disputes were about the standards to be applied in the litigation after the defendant was brought into custody and not disputes about whether or not there should be a magistrate interposed in the on-going system of -- the on-going investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.097" offset="7553818">The entire -- the common law authorities and the framers of the Fourth Amendment recognized that this was an accommodation of competing interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.180" offset="7602092">It was a substantial protection against illegal arrest in the home and elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.244" offset="7622363">There was an additional protection of -- against illegal arrests in the home by the requirement that the officers knock and announce their authority as Mr. Chief Justice mentioned earlier which is now law in most states, in many states by statute, and the purpose was to minimize the need for force, to give the people inside the ability to submit peacefully to the authority of the officer, but again these standards were tested in litigation after the defendant or the suspect was brought into custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.603" offset="7771784">The entire burden I think of Mr. Hellerstein's argument is that we have a search warrant requirement and therefore we must have an arrest warrant requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.018" offset="7809505">And if I may summarize the many reasons I think that those two powers and warrants are vastly different before I get into the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.010" offset="7849420">In the first place, the community -- the community's interests are vastly different in the two kinds of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.933" offset="7873139">The effect on the law enforcement functions are vastly different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.008" offset="7889439">And, thirdly, the search power is much more extensive and more intrusive than the arrest power and the need for a warrant requirement is much greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.418" offset="7927056">These are the very reasons why the two powers have been treated differently for so much of our history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.437" offset="7967180">Mr. Hellerstein says that there will be no burden on law enforcement if you interpose a magistrate before the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.086" offset="8005736">This Court has examined that argument twice relatively recently, once in Gerstein against Pugh, where Mr. Justice Powell called this an intolerable handicap for legitimate law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.123" offset="8061952">That characterization was repeated in Watson both by the majority and then by Mr. Justice Powell in concurrence again where he said that the interposition of a magistrate will "severely hamper effective law enforcement," and in fact it would severely hamper effective law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.053" offset="8153590">Any warrant requirement will have to be seen from the perspective of the police officers who are going -- going to have to live with this requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.780" offset="8204581">Just as an example, where Mr. Hellerstein criticizes the police in Payton for not getting a warrant after the afternoon of January the 14th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.953" offset="8269260">He says that they knew the name of the defendant and that they knew -- they looked at his building and he says they did nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.114" offset="8301861">He says they did nothing after that until the next morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.147" offset="8322027">Well, that's simply untrue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.882" offset="8328923">What they were doing is further investigation, and it's the kind of investigation that should be fostered by this Court, and the police should not be diverted from that kind of investigation in order to go get a warrant which would be a very time-consuming process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.291" offset="8394543">In fact, what they were doing was trying to put together a photo array so that they could know what the defendant looks like and also what they were doing is to try to find out where the defendant was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.280" offset="8442504">Knowing where the defendant's apartment is, is very different from knowing where the defendant is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.649" offset="8467999">Here, we have a defendant who two days earlier shot and killed the manager of a gas station and on that same night he goes to his friend and admits to the friend that he did it and also tells the friend that he is going "somewhere."</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.488" offset="8535395">This is the same defendant who must have known that two, perhaps three people in the gas station knew this defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.849" offset="8568832">It seems to me knowing the defendant's address in a circumstance like that is, as I say, very different from knowing where he is at any particular moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.575" offset="8607702">And it also seems to me that that is exactly the kind of situation in which the police should be encouraged to do further investigation and should not be diverted from that investigation by the very time-consuming process in which a warrant would be.</text>

            <text syncTime="2169.860" offset="8784812">The first thing the police would have to do from the moment they decide, well, now is the time we have to get a warrant, is they would have to gather together all the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.668" offset="8820130">Now, in this particular investigation there were many police officers who were doing this investigation, not just one.</text>
