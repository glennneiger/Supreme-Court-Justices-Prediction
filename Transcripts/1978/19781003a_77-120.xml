            <text syncTime="14.551" offset="161625">I believe that when we recessed on yesterday afternoon, I was discussing with the Court the Sheffield Case that arose in Sheffield, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.591" offset="213765">I believe that I had justified the Court that a three-judge District Court had unanimously ruled that the City of Sheffield did not fall within the definition of a political subdivision as defined in the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.788" offset="294536">And this Court, in a split decision reversed the District Court and as I read and understand the majority opinion, this Court is holding in effect that any political entity that has power over some aspect or any aspect of the electoral processes within a designated jurisdiction is covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.564" offset="429641">Now, I really don't know that I have any real basic quarrel with the decision of this Court, but I do say that it becomes necessary to review the Dougherty County Board of Education under the decision in Sheffield and inquire as to whether or not the Dougherty County Board of Education does in fact have any power over any aspect of the electoral process in Dougherty County, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.616" offset="553880">It is submitted that the answer to this inquiry is in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.430" offset="573106">There are many political subdivisions in the State of Georgia that have no control, no power, nothing to do with the electoral processes, and we say that the Dougherty County Board of Education is one of these.And others would be hospital authorities, payroll development authorities, county boards of health and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.253" offset="660355">None of whom have any function whatsoever in connection with the political processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.927" offset="691075">In the absence of control or power over the electoral process, neither the Dougherty County Board of Education or any other entity which has no responsibility or control, respecting election is, we submit, required to seek the approval of federal authority on a purely and simply personnel matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2258.406">I would want -- one additional argument that I would like to submit is that this kind of change and in terms of where is the line drawn I think that Congress in enacting Section 5 contemplated or was trying to deal with all sorts of changes and therefore it was the intent in fact by the submission process not to say specifically and not to be able to define specifically every conceivable change and indeed there was Attorney General Burt Marshall's testimony about the infinite variety of ways that school districts around the country had found to come up with new devices to delay desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.941">So that, whatever and there are all kinds of hypothetical suits can be submitted but the standard and the line to draw in this case is I think very clear and that line is where there is a rule or change which directly addresses the electoral system as this does, then that clearly, whatever the other kinds of potential hypothetical and potential factual situations would arise but that clearly is covered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2749.024">The key to this case in our view is to be found in this Court's statement five years ago in Georgia against the United States that Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act is not concerned with simple inventory of voting procedures but rather with the reality of change practices as they affect the Negro voter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.446">The problem in this case came to our attention as a result of the complaint filed on behalf of Mr. White and we took a look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.942">There's a stipulation in this record that as a result of the adoption of Rule 58, Mr. White was required to take a lead of absence of approximately three months time without pay in 1972, of approximately five months in 1974 and approximately three months in 1976.It was only in 1974 that he was involved and contested general election campaign as well as primary campaign and in the printed appendix on page 24 (a), at the bottom of the page, there is listed in his affidavit the sums of money that he lost in compensation as a result of the application of this rule to him even --</text>

            <text syncTime="2867.286">Well, what makes a difference as we view the purpose of Section 5 as explained by the Court and the quotation that I started my argument with, what makes a difference is the potential impact on the reality of affecting voting rights and we have to look to see what is involved here and compare it with the experiences that we've had under Section 5 which is what I'm attempting to do here for the benefit of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.892">As we look at the figures at the bottom of page 24 (a), we see first of all that these figures suggest that Mr. White is probably not a very affluent individual since three months of salary 1972 amounted to $2810.00 and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.771">The second thing we noticed is that these are rather substantial sums to have to be forfeiting in order to be able to run for office in comparison with the closest analogy that we have been dealing with under the Voting Rights Act in our experience which is changes in the size of filing fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="3194.931">It's true that this is not in form a filing fee but the economic impact on the face of it is very similar as a disincentive to run for office.</text>
