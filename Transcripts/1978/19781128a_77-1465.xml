            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="61.075" offset="347721">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.257" offset="360364">This case concerns the proper construction of the benefit provisions of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.471" offset="389308">The facts have been stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.482" offset="397249">In 1973, William C. Rasmussen was employed by petitioner Geo Control Incorporated under a public works contract with United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.276" offset="436433">Dr. Rasmussen was killed during the course of his employment and it is undisputed that the respondents, Dr. Rasmussen's surviving widow and son, are entitled to receive weekly death benefits under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.294" offset="484498">A dispute arose, however, concerning the amount of benefits to be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.616" offset="501844">Respondents claim that under Section 9 (b) of the Act, they are entitled to receive two-thirds of Dr. Rasmussen's weekly wages without limitation or a total benefit of approximately $530 per week.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.722" offset="558268">The employer and the insurer, however, have taken the position that this proposed award exceeds a ceiling on benefits under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.409" offset="588988">They contended and the Director of the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs agreed that the ceiling on disability benefit set forth in Section 6 (b) (1) of the Act is made applicable to death benefits as well by Section 6 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="136.619" offset="649801">The dispute came before the Benefits Review Board, which rejected the Director's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.650" offset="669968">The Board concluded that when Congress amended Section 9 in 1972 to delete a fixed dollar maximum on death benefits, Congress expressed its intention to free death benefits from any ceiling restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.847" offset="726810">The decision of the Board was upheld on review by the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.890" offset="742902">It's our position that when Congress deleted the fixed dollar maximum on death benefits in 1972 from Section 9 of the Act, they did so as part of an extensive revision of the Act and that a significant effect of that revision was to reformulate and transfer from Section 9 to Section 6 of the Act, the ceiling on death benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.252" offset="832345">As I will discuss, the legislative history shows the Congress intended to retain its ceiling on both death and disability benefits and that the effect of Section 6 (d) is to make the ceiling applicable to both.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.437" offset="885112">In order to place the amendments within their proper context, I will first briefly review their legislative history and then discuss the way in which the provisions accomplish what Congress intended.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="205.382" offset="924923">I take it then that your entire case rests on 6 (d)?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="209.948" stopTime="639.058">
            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="209.948" offset="943208">We believe that Section 6 (d) provides for the ceiling, the application of the 6 (b) (1) ceiling to death benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.468" offset="981243">We rest exclusively on 6 (d) except we regard 6 (d) is explained by the other provisions of the Act of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.370" offset="1012903">One of the deficiencies the 1972 amendments were designed to correct was the inadequacy of the fixed dollar maximums that were then applicable to death and disability benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.608" offset="1061804">From 1961 the maximum limited compensation to $70 per week.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.347" offset="1088763">The National Commission on State Workers Compensation Laws, which was chartered by Congress to recommend reforms in Workers Compensation Programs, reported to Congress in 1972 that a substantial percentage of covered workers received wages that placed them above the fixed maximum limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.928" offset="1171101">The Commission concluded that ceilings are justified as a means of containing the costs of the program and because high-income employees can and do obtain supplementary insurance from private sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.920" offset="1223032">They concluded, however, that in order to keep the ceilings current with inflation, the ceiling should be stated as a percentage of national average wages rather than as a fixed dollar maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.253" offset="1268381">And therefore they recommended specifically that the ceiling for disability and death both be initially established at a 125% of national average wages with phased-in increases over a three year period to an ultimate ceiling of 200% of average wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.807" offset="1338598">The legislation adopted by Congress in 1972 reflects the substantial imprint of this recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.667" offset="1366079">Indeed the Senate report suggests that the legislation is fully consistent with the Commission's recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.419" offset="1393037">In particular, Congress removed the fixed dollar maximum on both death and disability benefits and amended Section 6 (b) (1) of the Act to incorporate for disability benefits, a phased-in ceiling based on increase in percentages of national average wages just as the Commission had proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.779" offset="1474539">The Congress then simply added an additional provision, stating expressly that if the phased-in ceiling was applicable to death benefits as well, this case would have not arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.286" offset="1516544">Congress did not do that however.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.740" offset="1526366">The legislative history shows that in drafting Section 6 (d) though Congress intended to achieve this result and an additional objective at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.890" offset="1566908">The Senate and House reports note in drafting Section 6 (d), Congress was concerned that during the interval before the Commission's proposed phased-in ceiling reached its ultimate maximum of 200%, workers receiving an initial award of benefits would find their benefits unfairly limited in future years to the lower parentage ceiling than prevailing at the time of their initial award.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.851" offset="1662725">The reports state that the drafters of Section 6 intended “to the extent that employees receiving compensation for total permanent disability or survivors receiving death benefits, receive less than the compensation they would receive if they were no phase-in.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.721" offset="1730226">Their compensation is to be increased as the ceiling moves to 200%.”</text>
            <text syncTime="411.955" offset="1751228">The language of Section 6 (d) gains its meaning from this expression of congressional understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.253" offset="1776410">Section 6 (d) provides, in not these words but to this effect, that determinations made pursuant to Section 6 which include the determination of the phased-in ceiling for each period in Section 6 (b) (1), “shall apply to employees or survivors currently receiving permanent total disability or death benefits as well as to those newly awarded compensation during that period.”</text>
            <text syncTime="447.050" offset="1891558">It seems from the legislative history, the Congress understood Section 6 (d) to accomplish two results.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.205" offset="1920188">It provides that the periodic determination of ceiling benefits pursuant to Section 6 (b) (1) shall apply to survivors receiving death benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.397" offset="1964910">It further provides that as the phased-in ceiling is increased towards the ultimate maximum of 200% of average wages, the newly determined ceiling is to be applicable to survivors and to the permanently, totally disabled whether or not they receive their initial award in that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.944" offset="2043173">Thus if a person were to receive a survivor or disability award in the year where the ceiling was 125% of national average wages, three years later when the ceiling moved up to 200% of national average wages, their compensation would be adjusted up to that new ceiling.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.353" offset="2128750">Certainly, the language in Section 6 (d) can be understood the way Congress understood it.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.206" offset="2152155">The Section cannot adequately be understood any other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.618" offset="2169814">The Court of Appeals dismissed Section 6 (d) as only referring to the annual computation of national average wages which is performed by the secretary under 6 (b) (3) of the Act and the Court concluded that this computation was relevant only to the determination of minimum benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.731" offset="2246301">The Court said that Section 6 (d) merely assures that minimum benefits are adjusted annually to reflect inflation.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.971" offset="2283290">This construction of Section 6 (d) deprives the provision of any meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.767" offset="2306487">In amending, the Act in 1972, Congress adopted the additional recommendation of the National Commission and provided in Section 10 that the recipients of permanent total disability compensation and survivors' benefits the precise people referred to in Section 6 (d) are to receive an annual increase in their benefits equal to the percentage increase in national average wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.174" offset="2404080">As we have discussed in detail in our brief and as the Third Circuit fully described in their opinion in the O'Keefe case, the Section 10 inflation adjustment accomplishes precisely the result that the Court of Appeals in this case assigned to Section 6 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="593.827" offset="2478686">If Section 6 (d) means only what the Court of Appeals concluded, the Section is surplusage to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.039" offset="2507525">It's of course the Court's responsibility to give meaning to every word and clause of the statute where possible and this is especially true we submit in a situation such as this, where the legislative history reflects that the Section was intended to have an active role.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.867" offset="2582862">That role is articulated in the Senate and the House reports, which state their understanding that the adjustment under Section 6 (d) will make the phased-in, the redetermination of the phased-in ceiling on disability benefits applicable to both classes of beneficiaries.</text>

            <text syncTime="750.993" offset="3107297">10 (h) as you can see is a compendious provision, but the provision that it is relevant in this regard is 10 (h) (3) which is at the bottom of the right hand column on page 31, which makes subsection 10 (f) applicable to awards of benefits prior to the effective date of the amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.200" offset="3212204">Respondents say that the language in Section 6 (d) is ambiguous in that the remedial nature of the Act -- because of the remedial nature of the act, that they the statute should be constituted in their favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.368" offset="3272808">We, of course, agree that the Act is remedial, but the question here is what the purpose of Congress was in enacting this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.105" offset="3307813">The general -- there are certainly no general remedial policy that's ever been expressed that favors unrestricted ceilings on workers compensation benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.168" offset="3348041">The consistent course that State and Federal legislation in this area has been to provide equivalent ceiling limitations on both state, I mean on both disable permanent disability and death benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.985" offset="3407287">The few states that have departed from their consistent course have provided higher ceilings for disability than for death benefits and I think that reflects the underlying objectives or rational for the ceiling restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.983" offset="3463293">The ceilings consistently be then understood as justified by the need to contain the cost of the program and because high-income employees can and do obtain insurance to protect their supplemental needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.874" offset="3522853">Death is the risk that's most often insured against.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.591" offset="3537690">The brief submitted by the petitioner Geo Control notes approximately 95% of upper income employees obtained death insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.476" offset="3573321">So, if Congress were concerned with a choice as to which, where the remedial need were greater, they would presumably have concluded that disability was the greater need.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.556" offset="3617625">In it -- more over the need of the family is greater when the benefit must support not only the family, but the disabled worker as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.309" offset="3664645">And in light of all of these concerns, I think Chief Judge Wright was correct in the Boughman case in stating that it would have been anomalous for Congress to have left departed from that consistent remedial understanding of the consistent treatment of death and disability benefits without ever so stating.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.875" offset="3750849">I would like to note that the legislative history on which the Court of Appeals relies for its contrary conclusion, simply doesn't focus on the question that is presented here.</text>

            <text syncTime="937.550" offset="3853563">It was of course necessary to remove the fixed dollar maximum on death benefits from Section 9 to allow the higher, substantially higher ceiling benefits established in Section 6 to have affect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1063.652" offset="4357935">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.469" offset="4365249">My name is Albert Sennett and I represent Geo Control and the insurance company New Hampshire Insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.627" offset="4393880">The task of statutory construction is one of discerning the intend of a legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.844" offset="4414777">We submit that the intend of Congress in this particular matter to provide the same maximum limits for disability and death benefits can be discerned from the following considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.358" offset="4456782">Both bills, Senate Bill 525 introduced in the 92nd Congress and House Bill 3505 introduced in the same Congress provided for identical maximums.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.110" offset="4503803">Report of The National Commission of State Workers Compensation Laws recommended the same maximum weekly benefits for disability and death benefits and the report accompanying Senate Bill 238 states that the Committee believes that the provisions of the bill presented are fully consistent with the recommendations with National Commission in its report issued July 21, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.979" offset="4603277">As my brother has stated that the reference from 6 (d) of the Act to death benefits and disability benefits is also a fact to be considered by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.382" offset="4640893">This coupled with the fact that the 10 (f) of the Act makes the provisions for all the adjustments necessary, makes all these separate independent and meaning to 6 (d) as presented to this Court a few minutes ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.439" offset="4705155">The fact that the identical maximums are fully consistent with all State Workers' Compensation Laws is another fact to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.391" offset="4732949">The concept of payments to injured workers, who have been deprived of their wages by reason of industrial injury, is a concept to provide replacement of wage laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.436" offset="4789164">The consideration for replacing the wage laws in return calls for some limitation in the upper limits of liability in the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.125" offset="4823855">This has been consistently the type of trade-off and the type of political bargaining process that is in the history of this Act and the history of other State Worker's Compensation Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.639" offset="4865964">It is generally have been felt and we believe it is demonstrated again in this particular series of Sections that the upper limits of the places where the cut-off becomes effective, the theory being that the higher paid employees are capable of providing against the impact of death, capable of providing impact against disastrous loses to their family.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.625" offset="4969827">That the concern Congress showed in this particular instance was with the lower paid employees and the impact of this particular Act guarantees certain basic returns to lower employees, which were not present in the old Act and that seems to be the major thrust of many of the changes that they propagated in the 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.068" offset="5047672">The fact is that if Congress wished to depart from this traditional and historic consistent pattern, it would appear that some very clear express statement had been made with respect to the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.658" offset="5114023">Basically the respondent's position here is an attempt to interpret a the fact that one -- one Section of the Act there is no omission -- reference to these benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.236" offset="5168358">The other point that I wish to take in a few minutes that I have left in time that I have reserved for this Court, is that the argument advanced in the respondents' brief at page 28 suggest that the no ceiling limit is justified in industrial deaths because this represents only approximately 1% of all industrial injuries and perhaps some special exception would be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.834" offset="5266683">The fact of the matter is that death benefits are defined in the Section 9 of the Act is applying both to deaths which occurred directly as a result of industrial injury as well as deaths which are occurred by reason of unrelated causes, if at the time of the person's demise, he is suffering a permanent and total disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.976" offset="5347244">This is a much larger class of people and would give even an increased anomalous situation the ones that have been demonstrated in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.120" offset="5379845">In sum then we would respectfully submit that in light of the consistent pattern of providing for maximum limits in light of the fact that this is a compensation system meant to replace wage loss, there is then will be no consistency and no logic and assuming that Congress intended to depart from the traditional way of solving compensation loss cases and substituting them entirely in anomalous situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.438" offset="5493112">I intend to reserve about two minutes of rebuttal if the Court has any questions?</text>

            <text syncTime="1357.972" offset="5535222">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.110" offset="5547760">We believe that there are really two questions in this case; one to the Congress eliminate the death benefit maximum payments from the statute in the 1972 amendments and if they did so was the elimination a conscious and deliberate act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.825" offset="5610663">Respondent's answer to both questions yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.304" offset="5620590">Yes the Congress did eliminate the death benefit maximum payments from the Act and yes the elimination was a conscious and deliberate act by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.293" offset="5660505">When the statute is read as amended, one thing is apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.518" offset="5677432">In no Section is there a clear death benefit maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.755" offset="5690389">In Section 9, where the death benefit maximums have been set out traditionally and exclusively specifically at 9 (e) it has been eliminated, excised from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.646" offset="5733961">At Section 6 (b) there are a maximum set out a phase-in maximums, but they are applied only to disability by the clear language of Section 6 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.254" offset="5772413">Section 6 (d) does mention both death benefits and permanent total disability, but does not contain any maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.969" offset="5803238">It does have a purpose we submit, which we will discuss in a few moments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.853" offset="5822777">Because there has been some obscurity in Section 6 (d) and because eliminating death benefits maximums is a departure from this Act's history and in fact from general Workmen's Compensation prior tribunals have looked at the legislative history to determine what the intention of Congress was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.810" offset="5906578">In the legislative history, it's important to note that from the very beginning when S.2318 was first introduced by Senator Eagleton, maximums for disability and death were excised from the recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.162" offset="5964048">No mention whatsoever made of any maximums for disability or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.130" offset="5987871">Further from the beginning of the hearings in this matter, Senator Eagleton stated in his opening remarks that S.2318 “would eliminate the maximum payment limitations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.721" offset="6038235">And further from the beginning there was no doubt among all the witnesses testified before that Committee as to the effect and the intend of S.2318.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.591" offset="6081703">Needless to say there was much testimony on this proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.374" offset="6096854">It was discussed by Judge DeVany in his decision in order and also in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.989" offset="6119320">The industry side of course, opposing it, labor side generally thinking it was advisable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.117" offset="6143875">Following that testimony, a revised 2318 was submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.361" offset="6168848">It was substantially rewritten.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.693" offset="6178147">Section 6, 6 (b) (1) created a new maximum for disability based on an increasing national average weekly wage and it had a phase-in of this new maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.559" offset="6233631">Section 9 was also rewritten.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.895" offset="6242931">It is not overlooked, it's not forgotten.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.930" offset="6255052">Specifically at Section 9 (e) for instance, a new minimum was inserted by the revised 2318 which was tied to the national average weekly wage, a term added to the revised S.2318.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.921" offset="6311058">We think when the original S.2318's version of Section 9 (e) is seen and read and is compared to the revised S.2318 version of 9 (e) which was enacted into law, the reader finds a striking similarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.349" offset="6384724">In fact, the Sections are almost identical, except for changing the basis for the minimum benefits in deaths from a dollar figure to the national average weekly wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.269" offset="6428400">Respondents submit that it is beyond reason to say that Congress some how suffered some sort of collective amnesia and forgot what the original S.2318 meant, forgot what Senator Eagleton said it would accomplish and forgot the tremendous amount of testimony from the witnesses that described a very intent and action of S.2318.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.993" offset="6531323">Rather it is far more sensible and logical to say that the Congress realized what it was doing and that it consciously and deliberately did not add a maximum in Section 9 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.070" offset="6591613">Stepping back for a moment in the sequence of legislative history, just before revised S.2318 was written an important event took place and that was the report of the National Commission on State Workmen's Compensation Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.539" offset="6649501">It was submitted to the President and to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.797" offset="6662562">This report was a comprehensive study of State Workmen's Compensation Systems and it made certain recommendations for what it thought provision should be in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.545" offset="6705507">As with any other Commission, there are many members, many different view points and this is seen when one looks behind the recommendations to the discussions that led up to the recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.150" offset="6759946">For instance, when maximums and minimums were discussed by the Commission it was found to be only uneasy case for those and of two the Commission found maximums to be the more troublesome.</text>

            <text syncTime="1704.849" offset="6922742">Yes they, we believe they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.486" offset="6929324">We believe that there were some comments made that I am going to get you in a moment, where the report discusses death in a matter different from disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.707" offset="6970180">For instance, in the opening paragraph on death benefits, the Commission makes an interesting comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.705" offset="7002154">It says that death is the ultimate work related tragedy and deserves full compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.403" offset="7029008">Now later, of course, they reached the conclusion that the same maximum in their estimation should apply, but that statement was their opening statement with respect to death benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.423" offset="7069027">No similar statement was made with respect to disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.637" offset="7085955">Later in discussing the proportion of the wage that should be replaced in death cases, the Commission discussed the advisability that perhaps a higher percentage of the average wage of the deceased should be replaced in death cases, basing it on the incentive argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.307" offset="7148648">The incentive argument being that, when a worker is disabled, it is good for him, it is good for society, it is good for the industry if this individual is encouraged to get back to work and be productive again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.453" offset="7201207">Because of that, that is one reason why benefits are limited in workmen's compensation to a percentage of that wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.051" offset="7235584">Now, the Commission did end up as I said recommending the same percentage, but we believe that this discussion is important because this discussion was part of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.903" offset="7278947">It was something that the Congress read and must have considered when it revised 2318.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.354" offset="7312802">And it also establishes some discussion, some reason for having benefits higher in the death benefit case than in the disability case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.561" offset="7353657">The rationale was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.980" offset="7363271">Further as Judge DeVany pointed out, the recommendations of the National Commission with respect to death and disability were minimum recommendations only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.212" offset="7400260">Prior to each percentage that they recommended that are cited in the briefs, the Commission said the benefit should be at least this much.</text>

            <text syncTime="1831.976" offset="7431293">Isn't it true that a death benefit could be lost by a widow's remarriage in a fairly short period of time whereas a disability benefit could continue for a rather indefinite period of time?</text>

            <label>Mr. James Buckley Ostmann</label>
            <text syncTime="1845.578" offset="7485733">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.756" offset="7490435">If a widow remarries, she receives a lump sum payment and after that she gets no further death benefits and the disability of course could continue as long as a disability exists, permanent total disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.519" offset="7553442">There is a final important point about the National Commission's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.152" offset="7567966">It has been argued here that with respect to death benefits, the Congress intended to follow rather precisely, the recommendations of the National Commission and they cited something from the legislative history saying that, the new Act, the 1972 amendments were fully consistent with the National Commission's recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.160" offset="7644035">Implicitly then that the Congress did not intend to go beyond the National Commission recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.341" offset="7672769">However, there is another Section in the Act as amended that disproves this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.895" offset="7694921">It was mentioned by Mr. Sennett.</text>
