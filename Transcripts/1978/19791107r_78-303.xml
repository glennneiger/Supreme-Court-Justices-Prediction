            <text syncTime="15.988" offset="167372">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.572" offset="189628">Chief Justice Burger pointed out in this morning's arguments that the facts of this case aren't -- cases, the Colby case and the tandem case, the Stafford case this morning, are not the most important elements of the case because we're dealing with a relatively narrow personal jurisdiction issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.405" offset="264965">But I thought I would just briefly give you the jurisdictional facts in the Colby case.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.241" offset="292342">The jurisdictional facts are that Colby has no presence in Rhode Island and that Walters has no presence in Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.693" offset="330167">Colby was Director of Central Intelligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.822" offset="378650">His office was in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.983" offset="378546">He resides in Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.391" offset="378441">General Walters was Deputy Director of Central Intelligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.763" offset="386382">He resided in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.607" offset="393801">He now resides in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.548" offset="405608">Judge Pettine found in the District Court in Rhode Island that Colby and Walters did not have sufficient presence in that district to satisfy the Rhode Island long-arm statute which is one of the broad ones that extends personal jurisdiction as far as Fourteenth Amendment due process will permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.151" offset="503933">The facts of course in Colby involved the mail opening program and I think that's adequately been covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.460" offset="537161">The -- there was one thing this morning that was discussed that I'd like to touch on before I talk about the two points I plan to talk about and that was Mr. Justice Stewart, you had a discussion with Mr. Brown and the question was, what about habeas corpus and what about Schlanger?</text>
            <text syncTime="130.288" offset="624515">And wouldn't you have to or would you not have to reverse Schlanger if you didn't find for us in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="135.979" offset="647293">I think you'd have to reverse Schlanger.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.556" offset="657638">The arguments for not reversing Schlanger would be that in habeas corpus there is a special jurisdictional section and the First Circuit held that habeas corpus falls into the otherwise provided by law Section 1391 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="153.772" offset="718451">Well, it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.198" offset="724198">I read 2241 at least a dozen times.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.670" offset="738095">I just read it again and I read Strait against Laird.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.293" offset="756590">24 -- 2241 does not provide for jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.495" offset="773308">It does not provide for the venue.</text>

            <text syncTime="238.787" offset="1058565">Now, if 1391 (e) makes federal officials amenable to process all throughout the country, you have to reverse Schlanger.</text>

            <text syncTime="263.848" offset="1158771">The -- the two points I want to make is what standard do you have to apply in evaluating this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.323" offset="1184684">And I say that because of two sources, one, Justice Brandeis' opinion in Robertson and second, Mr. Chief Justice Burger's opinion in NLRB against Catholic Bishop of Chicago, the standard is, this statute cannot be interpreted to supply personal jurisdiction over federal officials throughout the United States unless there is clear expression of legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.272" offset="1300459">That comes from Robertson, the standard from Catholic Bishop is -- because there's a substantial constitutional question presented, you can't read the statute to provide jurisdiction unless there's an affirmative intent of Congress clearly expressed.</text>

            <text syncTime="335.522" offset="1445491">Of course it does, but it's carefully limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.391" offset="1452910">It says, "You only have venue where the course of action arose, where the defendants reside, or where an act took place by a defendant."</text>
            <text syncTime="347.560" offset="1493661">So it certainly satisfies Fifth Amendment due process because there are some affiliating circumstances with the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.564" offset="1521664">And to go to the district, we commit securities fraud to defend an action doesn't seem to me to place an intolerable burden on the right to defend to coerce Colby to go to San Francisco, Rhode Island, New York, to defend the same action, to bring his witnesses, to go there for depositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.651" offset="1602017">I say, imposes intolerable burden on his right to defend his opportunity to be heard and in Boddie against Connecticut where to get a divorce you have to file a $12.00 filing fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.163" offset="1656038">This Court held at a minimum due process and this is in Fifth to Fourteenth Amendment had a minimum due process requires a meaningful opportunity to be heard and if you don't have the $14.00 for filing fee, you don't have that opportunity.Our clients cannot afford to run around the country defending actions because while they were federal officials, someone has a gripe.</text>

            <text syncTime="427.165" offset="1812041">And I say on its face to require someone, Nelson Rockefeller or anyone else to expand such a substantial amount of his assets to travel around the country defending lawsuits where they didn't ask for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.118" offset="1863868">They didn't step into a district would place an intolerable burden on that right to defend.</text>

            <text syncTime="447.926" offset="1895111">Every time the Court's been faced with the issue of whether there's any Fifth Amendment limitation on Congress' power to provide nationwide jurisdiction they point it out in the case before them.</text>

            <text syncTime="466.005" offset="1967417">And I pointed out in my supplemental brief that in Leroy case just recently decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.429" offset="1993122">In the dissenting opinion, I believe it was written by Mr. Justice White, he said, "Of course there's nationwide jurisdiction which is constitutional in the federal courts because there's no Fifth Amendment limitation."</text>
            <text syncTime="484.629" offset="2041919">But what does he cite?</text>

            <text syncTime="489.122" offset="2059891">He decides -- he cites a Seventh Circuit case, the Simmons case which we discussed, he hasn't point out there's even a split in the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.260" offset="2096462">In Metz Apparatewerke cited in my brief, the Seventh Circuit said, "Yes, there is a finest limitation on the exercise of power to -- congressional power to provide nationwide jurisdiction and it's fundamental fairness, fair play similar to the International Shoe standard."</text>
            <text syncTime="519.962" offset="2183189">The -- the thing that I believe, it would be unconstitutional if you applied it in our case but I believe that there is no question that there's a substantial question raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.850" offset="2234807">Henry-Hatton and Hatton-Wexler discussed it and say, it's a substantial question, the Fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment have the same language, due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="975.423" offset="4005073">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.028" offset="4019493">It is beyond dispute that the Venue Expansion Bill, the Representative Hamer Budge first introduced in the 86th Congress would not had if enacted have covered suits like the ones here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.659" offset="4069961">Yet, applied only to suits against federal officers in their official capacity and at the opening of the hearings on that bill in the 86th Congress, Representative Budge described the kinds of suits and the kind of venue problem he was concerned with in terms that clearly exclude the kinds of suits we have here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.539" offset="4137566">Respondents contend and the court below found that by adding the phrase “under color of legal authority,” the committee considering Representative Budge's bill, thereby extended the venue provision to include these types of tort damage suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.141" offset="4195976">We believe that in examination of the circumstances under which this phrase got add into the legislation and emerged in the Revised Bill H.R. 12622, that's the subject of the -- of the report issued in the 86th Congress reveals that they're wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.642" offset="4257938">And we submit that the conclusion deserved from this -- derive from this examination of circumstances is confirmed by the explanation of the phrase in -- which is supplied in both House Reports, the one issued in the 86th Congress and the one issued in the 87th Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.562" offset="4321573">And by remarks of Representative Poff, who is a member of the subcommittee that considered that bill in the 86th Congress and who made remarks in the 87th Congress when the bill was initially passed by the House containing this phrase “under color of legal authority.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.739" offset="4386356">And I'm going to devote most of point time here to discussing how this phrase got into the bill and how it's explained in the House Reports and what Congressman Poff said this bill was all about when he explained it to his fellow Congressmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.145" offset="4447901">As I said, it's important to focus on the -- on the original bill in the 89th Congress because that's where the phrase came in and that's where some of these troubles since then have first appeared in that report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.764" offset="4490428">Regarding that original bill, it's true as Mrs. Peterson has said here this morning that Deputy Attorney General Walsh had written a letter to the Congress about that original bill that mentioned only official capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.309" offset="4536613">And he pointed out that it appeared to cover only mandamus actions the bill therefore knew nothing, because no court outside of the District of Columbia Circuit had mandamus jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.630" offset="4581857">He also did mention that there were two categories of cases involving suits against defendants and their individual capacity as federal officers and their individual capacity which would not be covered by the bill as drafted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.338" offset="4628773">One category of suits was the suits against the individual where you were -- you had a legal fiction that the man was acting outside of his authority in order to evade the sovereign immunity doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.125" offset="4679868">The other category of suits was -- were suits to seek damage from him personally for actions taken ostensibly on the course of his official duties but which the plaintiff claims were in -- excessive of official authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.777" offset="4734516">In the hearings on Representative Budge's bill, MacGuineas reiterated these points and he again pointed out that one category of these suits involved this legal fiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.953" offset="4779133">In view of Representative Budge's opening statement of what he intended the bill to cover, it was quite obvious that this first category of suits, the legal fiction category had to be covered in order for Representative Budge's bill to do what he wanted to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.973" offset="4835244">And that was to give review of administrative action out in the field against field officers without having your action foreclosed because the indispensable superior, party superior was in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.469" offset="4889266">Therefore, if they didn't put something in the bill, the whole purpose of the bill was going to be undermined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.523" offset="4909432">The phrase “under color of legal authority” was suggested by Committee Counsel Melvin Drabkin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.659" offset="4930017">And it's true that he had times in the hearing seem to distinguish suits -- personal suits for personal actions, personal -- outside the scope of employment actions against federal defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.145" offset="4987904">But he also said at page 57 of the hearings to MacGuineas, "I don't want the Government to be able to retreat behind any artificial concepts."</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.906" offset="5023013">So, what he seem to fear was that something was going on here, if they didn't change it in some way, the Government was going to somehow escape review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.538" offset="5057494">And it is true that MacGuineas pointed out that if you added this phrase “under color of legal authority,” there was the danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.436" offset="5081109">The possibility that some court might construe it to cover tort damage suits against the officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.416" offset="5105037">And then he said quite forcefully that this would be grossly unfair to federal officials because certainly, private individuals are not subject to suits in multiple forums for torts committed in the course of their employment and it was unfair to -- to treat federal officials differently for damage suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.540" offset="5173582">And slander actions were discussed as -- as a sort of paradigm case of these types that -- of suits that might possibly be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.948" offset="5211199">However, as soon as he had finished discussing this -- this possibility, the Committee Chairman and another committee member immediately agreed that it would be unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.572" offset="5249651">This was Representative Forrester and Representative Poff and that's at page 63 of the transcript of hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.491" offset="5273370">But the Congressman had several reasons to discount MacGuineas' fears that the courts would construe the language to reach this result that they agreed with was -- was unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.163" offset="5316002">First, Judge Albert Maris who -- representing the judicial conference testified really something of an expert witness, they seem to treat him as someone who knew how courts might interpret things and who knew what language should be used to -- to achieve their purposes, and he was asked, "Would it be advisable to add this phrase under color of legal authority?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.252" offset="5376397">And he said, "I would be very happy to see that, because it would be a way of putting to rest this fictional doctrine and get right down of what is really the fact reviewing administrative action."</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.292" offset="5440554">That's at page 91 of the transcript of hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.314" offset="5452675">Second, they had reason to discount this possibility that MacGuineas was holding up to them because the sponsor of the bill, Hamer Budge, disavowed on the record any intent of covering what he called, the slander type actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.940" offset="5507114">He said, "This is not what I have in mind."</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.111" offset="5519862">And as Justice Steven has pointed out, that was mainly what they focused on when they were giving examples of what damage actions might possibly be involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.791" offset="5566568">Third, the House Report issued shortly after these hearings concluded explained the reason for referring both the suits against officers acting in their official capacity and the suits against offers -- officers acting under color of legal authority and that explanation which is printed at page 37 of our brief and in language that has been quoted this morning by Mr. Nemser is written in terms that clearly not referred to these types of suits but clearly refer to suits in essence against the Government suits, in essence against the United States suits that involve this legal fiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.261" offset="5700420">Now, we submit that -- that these factors, these circumstances would have made the Congressman feel that perhaps MacGuineas was being unnecessarily finicky, unnecessarily fearful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.570" offset="5749635">Clearly they thought he was there trying to throw up problems to dissuade them from legislating anything at least they seem to express that feeling at times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.561" offset="5793625">And both the Senate and the House Reports on H.R. 1960 in the 87th Congress, started out describing the purpose of the bill, the bill -- the bill as a whole, not just the mandamus section, but the bill as a whole is being something that they're passing to facilitate review of administrative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.703" offset="5866141">And we submit that damage suits are not what you're talking about when you talk about review of administrative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.779" offset="5894457">Congressman Poff, made remarks in connection with this bill when it was voted on by the House in the 87th Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.833" offset="5926745">Now, this is -- when it was first voted on by the House, there were subsequently some amendments which don't directly affect us here and it was then revoted on by the House but -- but he was explaining to the Congress that was going to pass on this bill what it meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.922" offset="5979094">And at this time, it did contain a phrase under legal -- “under color of legal authority.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.699" offset="6006157">Representative Poff's remarks which are printed at Volume 107 of the congressional record, page 12157, "Are cast in terms that refer only to suits that are in essence against the government itself."</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.451" offset="6057148">He speaks of the balance of convenience between plaintiff and defendant in such suits, and insists that broadening the plaintiffs' options presents no problem, because as he observes, there are federal courts, federal attorneys, federal marshals, and federal agencies in every quarter of the nation, and that in fact the convenience of the Government would be promoted by trying the case in the local District Court where the paper is available, the property is accessible, and the witnesses are within easy reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.533" offset="6161533">Representative Poff ended his remarks with the following statement, "Our Nation was founded upon a profound respect for the rights of the individual citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.116" offset="6195806">The Government should be willing always to accommodate itself to the preservation of these rights more particularly, when the Government is the party in controversy with the private citizen."</text>

            <text syncTime="1560.964" offset="6347212">The damage suits here today are not controversies between the Government and respondents in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.519" offset="6373439">They are suits for damages to be paid out of assets of the individual petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.080" offset="6391724">In this case, Mr. Colby and Mr. Walters, who as pointed out, are now private citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.943" offset="6411160">It is true that they have been supplied with government-paid private counsel, but as noted, that is not assured in all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.712" offset="6442193">There are these factors that have to be satisfied, that there's a determination that they were acting in the scope of their employment, that there's a determination that it's in the interests of the United States to provide representation to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.921" offset="6491094">And as far as the private counsel program, private counsel are paid for when there's some possibility of conflict in representing all of the defendants, or some other problem with arguments that might wish to be raised, or any other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.892" offset="6558908">This is not assured at all, because this is subject to annual budgetary appropriations which may or may not come about from year to year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.347" offset="6592763">So there simply cannot be any assurance that Government representation is always there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.701" offset="6618154">In fact, I think at one point in the transcript, there was some reference to suits against Congressmen, and one of the Representatives said to MacGuineas, don't you always defend these?</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.794" offset="6654516">And he said, “Well, sometimes we do and sometimes we don't.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.472" offset="6669249">So it wasn't assured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.806" offset="6678549">It is easy to see in retrospect that greater care might have been taken by Congress to assure that Courts would not construe 1391 (e) more broadly than Congress evidently intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.452" offset="6721181">But we submit that the language that Congress did employ, "under color of legal authority" is not in itself so clearly indicative of an attempt to change this historic, defendant-oriented venue rules, that you simply ignore all of these other considerations that I've discussed here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1872.324" offset="7592626">This case arose out of the 20-year program of the CIA to open first class mail going to and from the United States and the Soviet Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.711" offset="7642258">It was conducted without consent of any of the correspondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.967" offset="7663261">It was conducted without a warrant ever being issued or applied for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.935" offset="7683114">It was, I think it cannot be plainer, illegal and in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.860" offset="7710804">In the course of the program, the CIA opened about 215,000 letters affecting 110,000 individuals, American citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.173" offset="7752077">In response to that, when the program became known in 1975, this suit was filed in order to vindicate the rights of the persons whose mail was opened and whose constitutional rights have been so sorely abused by their government, and by the officials who represented the government.</text>
