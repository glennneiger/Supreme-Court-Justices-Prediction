            <label>Mr. John M. Harmon</label>
            <text syncTime="61.326" offset="348662">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.823" offset="366634">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals, the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.733" offset="398294">The question presented is whether the National Environmental Policy Act requires executive agencies to prepare environmental impact statements for their annual budget estimates submitted to OMB for consideration in the preparation of the President's budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.951" offset="503202">Section 102 (2) (c) of NEPA provides that all agencies shall include an environmental impact statement in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.100" offset="611767">Respondents brought this action in July 1974 against the Secretary of Interior and the director of OMB alleging that the members of their respective organizations were adversely affected in their use of the National Wildlife Refuge System by certain proposals by the Department of Interior and OMB for the operation and maintenance of the refuge system.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.530" offset="757530">The respondents claimed that the annual budget request prepared by the Secretary of Interior and submitted to OMB were proposals for legislation and other major federal action within the meaning of the National Environmental Protection Act, and therefore required the preparation of environmental impact statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.377" offset="868916">The respondents sought a declaratory judgment to this effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.062" offset="887620">They also sought a declaration that NEPA requires OMB to prepare procedures and guidelines to identify budget submissions by other agencies which require the preparation of environmental impact statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.708" offset="978213">The District Court granted the respondent's motion for summary judgment holding that every budget estimate of an agency whose activities significantly impact on the environment is a proposal for legislation and other major federal action.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="241.169" stopTime="265.871">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="241.169" offset="1068074">I suppose Mr. Harmon that some of the actions of the 400 plus district judges in the United States and soon well over a hundred circuit judges to say nothing of other judges, might have an impact on the human environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.365" offset="1140799">Does that mean the judicial budget would have to have an impact statement?</text>

            <label>Mr. John M. Harmon</label>
            <text syncTime="265.871" offset="1166817">Mr. Chief Justice in the sense -- in the theory of this case that in fact the actions, a decision would necessitate action below that may be major federal action significantly affecting the environment on that theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.134" offset="1239960">Again, that would be the follow through.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.600" offset="1249782">However, the environmental impact statement requirements of NEPA do not apply to the judicial branch or to the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.507" offset="1289383">It's our contention that they apply to all agencies, executive agencies within the executive branch.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="303.564" stopTime="319.631">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="303.564" offset="1317595">But the thrust of my question was partly about impact as a -- it's really pretty difficult to major isn't it, to define and to bound?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harmon" startTime="319.631" stopTime="402.230">
            <label>Mr. John M. Harmon</label>
            <text syncTime="319.631" offset="1381857">Well, that is certainly our contention in the sense that the argument made by respondents throughout this case indeed adopted by the District Court was that the budget estimates submitted by an agency in fact were proposals for all the actions which would be financed by the appropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.071" offset="1495646">And that in that sense that the decisions, the budget decision was a decision to take those major federal actions with the significant environmental impact, and that is the broad reading that the District Court in fact accepted in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.924" offset="1571088">The District Court ordered, directed the Secretary of Interior, the Director of OMB to prepare and consider environmental statements for each annual budget request for the National Wildlife Refuge System.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.447" offset="1649142">In addition, the District Court held that NEPA requires OMB to prepare procedures to identify all budget estimates which require an environmental impact statement.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="402.230" stopTime="416.719">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="402.230" offset="1712253">Do you understand this holding to be for the presumed benefit of the agencies who are submitting their requests to OMB, or for OMB in submitting its recommendations to the President?</text>

            <text syncTime="416.719" offset="1770245">It is our understanding of the holding, Your Honors that in fact it is for the benefit, the identification for the agencies which would be submitting their requests to OMB.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.412" offset="1817057">That is the point at which the respondents have sought an -- the filing of an environmental impact statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.974" offset="1843284">The court below did not discuss the submission of OMB to the President for the consideration in the budget.</text>

            <text syncTime="443.715" offset="1878183">You get any sense that there is balance of taken a “new look” at their position from their brief in this Court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harmon" startTime="452.066" stopTime="544.236">
            <label>Mr. John M. Harmon</label>
            <text syncTime="452.066" offset="1911620">Your Honor, that is our contention, the contention we have made in our reply brief which we have filed for this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.254" offset="1940355">In fact, we think that the application of an environmental impact statement requirement to a submission by OMB in its function, in its budget function and the parts of OMB which provide and are specifically established for the purpose of providing advice and information to the President and the preparation of the President's budget are in fact beyond the reach of NEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.446" offset="2057174">And for that reason, that application would raise a new issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.964" offset="2087267">The Court of Appeals rejected the District Courts per se rule that every budget request is a proposal for legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.135" offset="2131884">Instead, the Court of Appeals adopted its own per se rule that every budget estimate, every budget request which is taken after a new look and in depth programmatic review of a program, or which involved a significant change in the status quo in the current level of funding that those budget estimates were in fact proposals for legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.440" offset="2273155">However, --</text>

            <label>Mr. John M. Harmon</label>
            <text syncTime="560.629" offset="2345880">Even if, even if the budget estimate is found by this Court to be a proposal within the meaning of the Act, it's our position that they are not a proposal for legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.957" offset="2399169">It's our position that Congress observed the traditional distinction that is maintained between the legislation and appropriations and did not intend to reach proposals for appropriations as distinguished from legislation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="590.262" stopTime="630.640">

            <text syncTime="590.262" offset="2464371">I think I followed you with respect to a positive proposal to build a dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.534" offset="2493524">But suppose that Interior has already established an ongoing program for wildlife refuge, and suppose then that the word comes down to cut interiors budget by 10%?</text>
            <text syncTime="613.714" offset="2558203">And so they reflect this in their budget request by eliminating funds for that particular program.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.675" offset="2602088">If a statement is not required there, it never will be required.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harmon" startTime="630.640" stopTime="632.239">

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="632.239" offset="2632286">I'm drawing the distinction between a positive action and a negative one.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harmon" startTime="635.747" stopTime="984.587">
            <label>Mr. John M. Harmon</label>
            <text syncTime="635.747" offset="2646392">And I appreciate your point.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.661" offset="2654020">The -- in our position on that is that the, first in the real sense the budget decision a 10% cut on a particular program, the decision is made, the budget, the appropriations decision, the funding decision, the economic decision and the political decision made by the President as to what the shape and content of his budget will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.671" offset="2766033">That is made first.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.825" offset="2774706">The implementation of that decision must await of course the approval by the full Congress of that appropriation request.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.580" offset="2817651">But in the real sense, there is no concrete, in most instances, there is no concrete proposal with respect to what Interior will do with this program or that program, whether it will not complete this dam or will undertake -- will cut enforcement personnel in another area.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.738" offset="2898317">Those decisions in the main, in the real sense are made subsequent to the budget decision, the paper decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.544" offset="2933530">The decision to which you refer, the action, the major federal action if it might be determined to be so, is an underlying action.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.641" offset="2973968">An underlying project, an underlying decision we acknowledge as we must that in fact the underlying project beginning or ending might in fact require an environmental impact statement depending upon the analysis of the given situation, the given factual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.464" offset="3057246">But it is the underlying project, the underlying action and not the appropriation which is the major federal action under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.618" offset="3109804">The Court of Appeals in this case, again subsequent to the District Court's decision, the Department of Interior did prepare a detailed policy review of the Refuge System program.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.190" offset="3188172">The Court of Appeals had that review before it and held that this programmatic review satisfied the government's current obligations under NEPA with respect to the annual budget request for the National Wildlife Refuge System.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.165" offset="3264031">However, the Court of Appeals added and held that in the event of any significant change in the status quo, or any re-evaluation of the refuge program, the environmental impact statement requirements would apply anew.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.810" offset="3346578">The Court of Appeals went on to affirm that part of the District Court's decision that NEPA does require OMB to formulate procedures to identify the agency, the annual agency estimates which must be accompanied by an environmental impact statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.956" offset="3439156">As I have tried to outline, we would make three arguments to support our position that the judgment below should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.991" offset="3483355">The first, as I've again attempted to describe is that the annual budget estimate submitted to OMB for consideration in the preparation of the President's budget is not a proposal as that term is used in NEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.901" offset="3562977">In the executive budget process, the point at which there is a proposal, a formal proposal as that term was defined by this Court's decision in Kleppe versus Sierra Club is when the President submits his budget to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.618" offset="3649808">The annual budget estimates which are prepared by the agencies submitted to OMB in September for consideration in the preparation of the President's budget are but part of the germination process leading to the final proposal, again the President's budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.967" offset="3751267">Respondents argue that these budget estimates are final proposals because the agency is -- no further action is required by the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.342" offset="3808737">But the fact that the agency may have had its last word on a budget proposal, a budget estimate, does not make that a final proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.644" offset="3853981">Indeed Congress has vested in the President the exclusive statutory authority to prepare and submit to the Congress the budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.745" offset="3906330">That was in the budget in the Accounting Act of 1921 in that same statute, Congress expressly prohibited the agencies from submitting independent budgets to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.220" offset="3960247">Since the agencies neither have the authority, indeed they are expressly precluded from submitting these budget estimates to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.568" offset="4005595">Those estimates can only be part of the process of the development of a final proposal, the President's budget.</text>

            <text syncTime="984.587" offset="4041749">Would you analogize it Mr. Harmon to the process which a division of a department submits to the head of the department before the department itself submits the total budget request to the OMB.</text>

            <text syncTime="1001.107" offset="4107786">Mr. Chief Justice it would be exactly our point that if the respondents contention were correct that the fact that the agency has had its final word, its last say that no further action is required by the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.004" offset="4175391">If that made this a final proposal then as you suggest that each stage of the way, and that's the way the budget process works from the field office, from the person located in charge of an individual refuge area all the way up, at each level of review with a broader perspective that at each level there would be a final proposal, if that were the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2735.009" offset="11043401">Our point is that one is required under the terms of NEPA itself and more importantly that the primary purpose of an environmental impact statement is to serve the agency which is making a proposal for legislation, or making a proposal for major federal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.631" offset="11117902">And that the EIS needs to be prepared not as an post hoc justification for an allocation on the part of an agency for a particular program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.401" offset="11160952">But rather in order to analyze the potential consequences over proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.124" offset="11183835">In fact the terms of NEPA itself speak as if a proposal might be implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.535" offset="11213511">Section 102 (2) (c) says that “should a proposal be implemented” indicating that not all of the final decisions will have been made regarding budget allocations and regarding commitments to funding for a given program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.003" offset="11291355">Under the terms of NEPA, we would suggest that if the Congress had intended to exclude such a major function of the governmental process from the terms of NEPA, it would have done so expressly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.167" offset="11364080">Indeed, the Freedom of Information Act passed approximately fours years prior to NEPA, did expressly exclude various forms of documents from public disclosure and that Congress could well have said in passing NEPA that it intended to exclude budget requests from proposals for legislation or proposals for major federal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.201" offset="11472227">It did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.259" offset="11480377">Those federal courts which have interpreted NEPA and the budget process have also suggested and held that EIS need to be prepared for budget request.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.219" offset="11544221">In addition, CEQ has consistently stated as we indicated that budget requests for appropriations need to be accompanied by environmental impact statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.210" offset="11592182">Even the implementing agency regulations have indicated that NEPA covers their budget requests, although none have ever complied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.470" offset="11661249">The proposal for legislation in this case, we believe clearly covers a budget request and that the term legislation is intended to embrace the -- and appropriations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.689" offset="11734079">In addition, the term major federal actions, we believe embraces the term budget request or a request for appropriations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.302" offset="11780577">In many instances, discrete federal projects have been accorded environmental impact statement coverage, and we believe that in an instance where a discrete federal project is subject to the terms of the Act, it certainly a decision by the agency to commit major resources represents the first and critical significant decision at the agency level which would warrant an EIS for that proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.153" offset="11928012">The Government has indicated that there is a conflict between the terms of the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 and the terms of NEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.930" offset="11975137">And we would submit that in fact is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.628" offset="11993840">There is no conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.642" offset="12001991">There is no conflict and under the terms of the Act itself, confidentiality is not provided and environmental impact statement is an independently prepared document, one which can serve the purpose of agency decision making and which would not require the disclosure of actual budget materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.281" offset="12100524">In addition, any documents which are made available to the public can be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.273" offset="12144515">And we would submit that in this circumstance where there are limited number of instances involving a limited number of programs that the budget request process is covered by NEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.249" offset="12200417">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3032.580" offset="12233644">Mr. Chief Justice, in response to counsel's point attempt to describe the consistent interpretation of the NEPA requirement, I would simply like to point out that the Congress which passed NEPA has for 10 years received and acted upon budget proposals from the President without the preparation of environmental impact statements by the agencies making their individual proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.648" offset="12373974">I make this point simply to underline that this illustrates a common understanding of both Congress and the executive branch as to the inapplicability of NEPA to the budget process.</text>
