            <text syncTime="26.227" offset="210380">I am Michael Cavanaugh of Lansing, Michigan appearing on behalf of the respondent -- excuse me, the petitioner, Dr. Ronald Hutchinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.162" offset="246115">This is a civil action by Dr. Hutchinson, a research scientist against the United States Senator William Proxmire and his aide Morton Schwartz, seeking damages for libel, slander, interference with contractual relations and invasion of privacy, and intentional infliction of mental anguish.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.806" offset="320616">The basis of federal jurisdiction is diversity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.542" offset="339634">In March of 1975, Senator Proxmire launched a series of monthly press releases which were designed according to Senator Proxmire to focus national attention upon what he considered as the greatest waste of taxpayer money that could be located that month.</text>

            <text syncTime="93.445" offset="479232">Your Honor, there are three possible choices, Wisconsin, the District of Columbia, and the State of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.730" offset="500339">We believe that the appropriate state law to be applied would be the State of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.785" offset="516535">The petitioner resides in the State of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.685" offset="532208">The publication was nationwide but the greatest impact would be in the State of Michigan, and we think that under the Wisconsin choice of law provisions they would look to the impact of the tort and that Michigan law would be applied.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="118.763" offset="580483">But it would be a question of Wisconsin choice of law then?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_e_cavanaugh" startTime="121.562" stopTime="340.163">
            <label>Mr. Michael E. Cavanaugh</label>
            <text syncTime="121.562" offset="591663">That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.365" offset="606919">It is our contention Your Honors that a review of the press releases issued by Senator Proxmire that are contained in this record along with the evidence that relates to them will show that the press releases typically will take a small part of a research project, distort it and then indicate that the full amount of the research grant was granted for that project.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.066" offset="685704">The press releases are typically filled with sarcasm and humiliate the researcher involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.009" offset="717469">In April of 1975, Dr. Hutchinson was selected for the “Golden Fleece of the Month Award.”</text>
            <text syncTime="159.979" offset="745368">The Golden Fleece issued for Dr. Hutchinson contained defamatory and untrue statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.401" offset="771072">The following statements among others were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.255" offset="782461">The Government paid one half million dollars to find out that anger, stopping smoking and loud noises produce jaw clenching.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.907" offset="813077">All this money was given to Dr. Hutchinson of Kalamazoo State Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.742" offset="832408">In fact, the good doctor has made a fortune from his monkeys and in the process made a monkey of the American taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.849" offset="860829">The press release also stated that Dr. Hutchinson's research work was perhaps duplicative.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.326" offset="886742">In the course of the depositions, the respondents have admitted that prior to issuance of the press release they knew that the $500,000.00 did not go to Dr. Hutchinson personally, but rather was paid to the State of Michigan and used by the State of Michigan to pay salaries, to pay for supplies, overhead and similar expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.361" offset="974827">As far as the statement that in fact the good doctor has made a fortune from his monkeys, the respondents contended in deposition that this was merely a reflection of Dr. Hutchinson's status and power as a researcher, and a reflection of his income which they claim is among the highest percentages of income in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.124" offset="1053926">In fact, at the time the fleece was issued, Dr. Hutchinson's salary from the state was $30,000.00 which was the highest at any time covered by the fleece.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.126" offset="1089975">The period of time he served as a college professor, the salary would've been considerably less.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.039" offset="1113590">In depositions, the respondents had also admitted that prior to the issuance of the press release they received statements from the funding agencies that gave the true nature of Dr. Hutchinson's work.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.856" offset="1160819">The Office of Naval Research and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, particularly gave statements to the respondents which indicated that Dr. Hutchinson had for the first time, given those agencies, an accurate method of detecting and measuring aggression.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.174" offset="1230096">The Navy hoped to use that research in training and selecting submarine crews.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.526" offset="1251516">NASA hopes to use that research in selecting crews for long range space missions.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.895" offset="1280982">In addition to the press release, the respondents issued a newsletter in April of 1975 which repeated many of the same defamatory statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.872" offset="1328943">This newsletter was sent to over 100,000 persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.692" offset="1344199">Some of whom resided in the Senator's home state of Wisconsin, and some of whom did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.082" offset="1365723">A second newsletter was issued in February of 1976, which also referred to Dr. Hutchinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.687" offset="1392159">In addition, Senator Proxmire made statements regarding Dr. Hutchinson's work on radio and television, including the Mike Douglas Show where the Senator referred to Dr. Hutchinson's work as “the most outrageous example of wasteful, extravagant, stupid spending.”</text>
            <text syncTime="338.932" offset="1461123">In addition to these activities --</text>

            <text syncTime="351.951" offset="1513263">His work was specified in such detail that he could be identified from what was said.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.618" offset="1531862">And in fact there are affidavits in the record, Your Honor, which indicate that people did recognize a Dr. Hutchinson was being referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.998" offset="1561433">The prior press release issued by Senator Proxmire certainly aided in the identification later of Dr. Hutchinson.</text>

            <text syncTime="383.477" offset="1639278">In addition, there may have been other ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.018" offset="1649518">The Senator indicated in his deposition that he could not recall if there are other ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.191" offset="1666236">I believe there are some affidavits in the record which we filed from people who indicated that they believe that they heard mention of this sort of thing and other entertainment type television shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.219" offset="1710331">In addition to these actions, after the press release was issued, the Senator's aide made telephone calls to the various funding agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.192" offset="1746171">During some of those calls, defamatory statements were made and pressure was apparently exerted on those agencies to cause them to cease funding Dr. Hutchinson's work.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.351" offset="1790788">Dr. Hutchinson filed suit and the defendants moved for summary judgment on the basis of the Speech or Debate Clause in the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.792" offset="1828613">The District Court granted summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.096" offset="1841779">The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed holding one, that the press release and the newsletters were absolutely immune under the Speech or Debate clause, even though they may have contained defamatory material.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.275" offset="1898517">Secondly, the Court of Appeals held that the radio and television interviews and the calls to the funding agencies to seek termination of the research grants were not immune under the speech or debate clause, but they were protected under the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1605.473" offset="6527310">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.299" offset="6538595">A proper assessment of this case, we maintain, requires some examination of the facts of how Congress actually operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.977" offset="6573286">I'd like to review a few pertinent facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.692" offset="6588228">In the year of the filing of this suit, President Ford had submitted a budget to the Congress of just short of $400 billion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.418" offset="6627098">In that budget was some $25 billion allocated for research and development.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.691" offset="6652176">That year proved to be an all time high of $76 billion in deficit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.211" offset="6678298">The competitors for research and development funds included such national interest topics as energy research, national defense, environment and health.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.501" offset="6727408">It is an annual ritual when this budget is submitted to the Congress that a review take place which spends most of the legislative year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.014" offset="6761472">That review process is the responsibility first to the Appropriations Committee and many of its subcommittees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.787" offset="6796581">It conducts hearings along with formal review process and a report to the Congress and legislation submitted to the Congress is an informal review process that goes on continually throughout that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.931" offset="6861155">That is, the budget officers in each of these various agencies contact the appropriations staff and they exchange information and they are asked to give more support for particular items, to eliminate some items and to get the budget into what the Congress deems to be a proper shape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.262" offset="6950494">In that same process is going on in the House on parallel committees similarly structured.</text>

            <text syncTime="2089.853" offset="8464865">After 16 years in Congress, he made the decision that he could be much more affective in that criticism if he narrowed his focus and made some particular or dramatic representation of waste in government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2133.898" offset="8641034">He has explained in his deposition the reason why he does this is that debate and speaking on the floor is not a debating process in the modern Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.978" offset="8689309">Senators do not attend speech and debates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.715" offset="8708326">They do not read the congressional record or they are not apt to generally, but they do read the newspapers about what has occurred in Congress.</text>
