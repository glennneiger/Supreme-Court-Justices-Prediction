            <text syncTime="65.450" offset="365171">The question presented by this case is whether a statute which provides for the summary suspension of the occupational license of a harness racing participant prior to any hearing on disciplinary charges denies such licensee due process or equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.015" offset="447404">A statutory District Court for the Southern District of New York held that it indeed it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.996" offset="471333">We respectfully disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.808" offset="478647">We have appealed and we asked this Court to reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.826" offset="494634">On June 22nd of 1976, a horse named Be Alert which was trained by the plaintiff run second in a race at Monticello Raceway.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.723" offset="538311">Prior to the race, a blood test was conducted to determine whether any drugs were in the horse's system.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.085" offset="571747">That test was passed, however, subsequent to the race, a urine test was conducted and traces of a drug called Lasix were found in the horse's urine.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.970" offset="623261">At page 6a of the jurisdictional statement note 5 in the opinion of the three-judge court, the Court pointed out that Lasix is a diuretic and may in fact enhanced the performance of the animal.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.623" offset="681880">Under the rules of the Racing and Wagering Board, no such drug may be given to the horse within 48 hours of a race.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.820" offset="718660">As I indicated, this race was conducted on June the 22nd, two days later, the post race test results came back and Mr. Barchi, the plaintiff was called before the stewards.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.828" offset="774666">He was given word of this test results and was asked for an explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.756" offset="810402">Subsequently, both at his initiative and at the initiative of the Racing and Wagering Board, two separate polygraph test were taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.433" offset="857109">Apparently, the polygraph indicated that Mr. Barchi was being truthful in his statements and despite the efforts of the Board to find out exactly what happened to the horse an inconclusive investigation in sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.673" offset="934013">On the 8th of July, the trainer's license was suspended on the basis of what is called the trainers responsibility rule as in the case of a ship's captain who is responsible for everything that goes on board, the trainer likewise is responsible for the health and condition of his horse.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.251" offset="1032338">Now, we had the opportunity as we indicated for an informal conference at the time he was originally confronted with the results of the test and we suggest that this would come within the Rule of Goss against Lopez.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.699" offset="1102137">Under the statute, Section 8022 of our unconsolidated laws, he could have had a full quasi judicial hearing within a few days, however, he did not avail himself of this opportunity to be heard and as a result, this case was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.539" offset="1193566">Under Section 8022, a licensee is the prime mover of any hearing conducted as a result of disciplinary action taken against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.408" offset="1253021">Only he may demand the hearing and he must demand it within 10 days.</text>
