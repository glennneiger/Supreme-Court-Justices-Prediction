            <label>Mr. E. D. Vickery</label>
            <text syncTime="18.062" offset="175626">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.386" offset="196942">These two cases combined for purposes of this hearing bring to the court for a resolution, that question which it did not have to reach in a decision in 1977 and what had commonly been come to known -- to be known among the bar as the Caputo case.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.281" offset="280534">In the Caputo case, the court held that an amphibious worker who is subject to being assigned to work both on the dock and on the navigable area -- navigable waters of the United States was a type of worker that Congress intended to cover in order to provide a uniform compensation system for him in the 1972 amendments to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.600" offset="397772">Caputo was such an amphibious worker being subject to assignment either on the dock or on the vessel on the navigable waters in the course of his employment on the date of his accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.705" offset="450226">Petitioners respectfully submit that it is this navigable water standard on which the court turned in its Caputo opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.833" offset="490663">It is founded on historical decisions of this Court, stemming back to the famous case of Southern Pacific versus Jensen.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.823" offset="522637">Counsel in this case had drawn the line of demarcation between the two positions very clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.301" offset="560567">Simply speaking in extending the Act's jurisdiction to show in 1972 and Congress intend to provide a uniform compensation system for amphibious workers who were covered prior to 1972 for only a part of their work activity, that part which was done on navigable waters, as we respectfully submit, that is all that Congress contended.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.754" offset="658369">Or did Congress contend -- intend as a federal respondent asserts to cover all waterfront workers who work on piers, wharf, terminals and other areas adjoining navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.748" offset="714376">Before this Court in Caputo, the federal respondent contended that it reach only those waterfront workers who were directly involved in the loading or unloading of land transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.512" offset="761396">That was their position in reply to our petition for certiorari in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.423" offset="781040">In their reply brief here, they had expanded this to include all waterfront workers who may be injured on piers, wharves or other terminal areas that meet the situs test of the 1972 amendments.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="183.763" offset="838405">Mr. Vickery, this case doesn't involve any controversy about situs, does it, but only about status?</text>

            <text syncTime="191.567" offset="869648">Situs is not at issue, Bryant, the cotton header was injured in a warehouse and the vessel would moor outside at the pier alongside this warehouse and Diversion Ford was injured on railroad tracks, it ran out onto the pier in the Port of Beaumont Navigation District, so situs is not an issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="217.176" offset="972048">Question of status.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.927" offset="979048">Situs exist only to the extent that the federal respondent now contends that situs only is enough to also satisfy the status test.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="226.729" stopTime="227.771">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="226.729" offset="1010291">Hmm, yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="e_d_vickery" startTime="227.771" stopTime="379.976">
            <label>Mr. E. D. Vickery</label>
            <text syncTime="227.771" offset="1014471">But other than that, situs is not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.406" offset="1032965">Oddly enough we're not too far apart insofar as the factual situations existing in these three cases either.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.907" offset="1071000">There's not much of a dispute as far as that is concerned but there are very distinct differences in the types of employment that these men were engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.681" offset="1118124">First of all, this Court recognized that Caputo was a regular longshoreman or a longshoreman by occupation.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.174" offset="1152084">That is, he spent a substantial part of his working time in the actual loading or unloading of vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.623" offset="1181863">Neither Ford nor Bryant spent any substantial period of time in loading or unloading vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.213" offset="1216240">In fact, Bryant had not engaged in the loading or unloading of cargo from a vessel for approximately five or six years prior to the day of his accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.497" offset="1261380">Ford had participated in the loading and unloading of vessels in the Port of Beaumont on only seven days during the year immediately prior to his injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.574" offset="1305684">Ford was not a longshoreman by occupation.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.413" offset="1321044">He would be more aptly described as a laborer.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.063" offset="1331597">He worked approximately seven days as a longshoreman during the year prior to his injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.237" offset="1356361">He worked approximately 35 or 36 days as a warehouseman doing the type of work he was doing here, loading or unloading land transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.347" offset="1400769">The rest of the time we don't have specific dates but during the rest of the time he also did construction work in the Beaumont area and he also drove a beer truck for a beer distributor.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.462" offset="1449253">So there is no way to classify either of the two men involved in this case as being longshoreman or as having engaged in loading or unloading of vessels prior to their injury of enough significance to make them longshoreman by occupation.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.619" offset="1517798">In fact, Ayers Steamship Company for whom Bryant works has no stevedoring operations at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.326" offset="1544652">It never loads or unloads a vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.409" offset="1556982">It is a steamship agent who assembles cargo for the vessels that it represents in the warehouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.168" offset="1584044">It uses warehouse workers like Bryant to unload the land transportation, to load -- to stow the cargo in the warehouse to await the arrival of the vessel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1242.902" offset="5074944">Now, the position of the Department of Labor is that the Act applies to all waterfront employees who are engaged in the process of transferring cargo between land and water transportation.</text>
