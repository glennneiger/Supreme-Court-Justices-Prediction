          <turn speaker="norman_j_watkins" startTime="65.539" stopTime="274.161">
            <label>Mr. Norman J. Watkins</label>
            <text syncTime="65.539" offset="365484">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.264" offset="376456">This is an appeal from a three-judge court determination that two of Pennsylvania statutes, which provide that parents may voluntarily admit their children to mental health or mental retardation treatment in Pennsylvania facilities are unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.430" offset="441135">The statutes involved, are first, a 1966 Act that provides that parents of a mentally retarded child under the age of 18 may apply for voluntary admission of that child to treatment upon acceptance and the determination that the child is in fact in need of mental retardation therapy.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.360" offset="520861">The child may then be admitted upon the application of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.803" offset="534549">The 1976 Act provides that parents of a mentally-ill child under the age of 14, upon the application of the parent and upon the determination of a psychiatrist or physician of the need for treatment may consent to the voluntary treatment of that child.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.002" offset="607378">Furthermore, under the 1966 Act, Pennsylvania promulgated regulations that require -- and this deals with the mentally retarded again that require not one but two independent medical determinations that the child is in fact retarded and requires the treatment which has been recommended.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.960" offset="679163">The plaintiffs in this case and there are 12 of them, nine of whom are mentally ill and three mentally retarded, all were admitted upon application of their parent or guardian or one standing in loco parentis.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.006" offset="739349">Eight were in fact admitted by their parents and four were admitted by childcare agencies in as much as they were for one reason or another words of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.600" offset="777801">Each of these children, and this is typical, have had, and the record shows this, a minimum of three independent medical evaluations indicating the need for the treatment for which about which they were receiving.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.546" offset="833599">Furthermore, not one of these appellees nor any members of the class involved -- strike that.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.570" offset="865677">Not one of these appellees sought to terminate that treatment by way of any of existing court procedures of which they may avail themselves from moment one after the admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.523" offset="909458">Furthermore, as we stand here, some of the appellees remain in the treatment setting and there is no proceed -- there are no proceedings underway in state court to terminate that treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.651" offset="953971">Nevertheless, the plaintiff's brought this challenge primarily and exclusively on the Due Process Clause asserting that prior to the effectuation of the admission, the children had a right to counsel and the full panoply of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.262" offset="1012381">The lower court agreeing with the plaintiff's ordered essentially two hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.418" offset="1028995">First, what was called a probable cause hearing at which it would be determined if in fact the child -- if in fact there was probable cause in the courts or the tribunals view to believe that the child was mentally ill or retarded and whether or not the medically recommended treatment was in fact advisable.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.975" offset="1103287">Within two weeks of that hearing, assuming affirmative findings on both counts, the tribunal would convene a full adversary proceeding at which the findings required are whether in fact the child is mentally ill or retarded and whether in fact the treatment which has been medically recommended is approved by the court or tribunal.</text>

            <text syncTime="280.793" offset="1226585">Initially the lower court required judicial hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.532" offset="1241527">This order was slightly amended to allow the state to provide neutral trib -- an independent neutral tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.401" offset="1269008">However, it should be noted that this tribunal must have the authority to protect the child's rights which are specified by the order to cross-examination to present testimony and furthermore to approve a waiver of this significant constitutional right which the child has been given by the lower court's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.742" offset="1354376">So, I would --</text>

            <text syncTime="319.203" offset="1380185">I would suggest also that the Court's modifications as to the tribunal and counsel, that the requirement of counsel has been substituted by a requirement for a trained advocate.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.030" offset="1427519">However, once again, this trained advocate must be able to vouchsafe the child's rights to cross-examine, confront witnesses, to present testimony and in fact must be able to make the legal determination of whether or not the child should waive his rights to --</text>

            <text syncTime="521.660" offset="2189981">Obviously when one looks at the relationship between prosecutor and defendant in the criminal context, there is a conflict of interest from inherent in that relationship and it should be presumed.</text>

            <text syncTime="543.328" offset="2276707">Finally and has been discussed at great length in the prior argument, the lower court's order ignores entirely the traditional role of the family in these decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="4056.810" offset="16330585">Secondly, I believe, Mr. Justice White you inquired us to whether or not Pennsylvania inspects these private facilities and Pennsylvanian all requires at 62 pertinent statutes 911 that an inspection be conducted at least annually as to the conditions in the facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="4076.006" offset="16407385">The third point I wish to make is a clarification of a question addressed by Mr. Chief Justice Burger on whether or not any of or what the basis of Commissioner Glenn's testimony or conclusions was with respect to the erroneous submissions of children in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="4097.653" offset="16494007">The fact of the matter is that not one of the experts that testified in this case examined any of the children involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.763" offset="16534444">And the record reflects this very clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4109.493" offset="16541341">For example I cite 2495 (a) of the appendix where Dr. Finder candidly admits that he was not familiar with any of the conditions in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.889" offset="16578957">635 (a), Dr. Messenger admits that the only thing that he was familiar with at the time of his testimony was that which was provided by counsel dealing with the legal process involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.147" offset="16623992">And finally 1030 (a), where Commissioner Glenn indicated that her only familiarity was with the regulations that was provided to her prior to her testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4140.871" offset="16666833">Finally, I would only submit that the coverage of a lower court's order with respect to community-based facilities is clearly addressed in my reply brief, the green-covered reply brief and I defer to that.</text>
