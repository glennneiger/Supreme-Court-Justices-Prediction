            <text syncTime="16.726" offset="170297">When Congress made the railroad land grants that reserved a total of approximately 100 million acres of public lands that were interspersed, checkerboard fashion with the lands that it had granted to the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.510" offset="221393">The railroad received the odd-numbered sections that completely surrounded each of the retained public sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.656" offset="250023">It's not possible to either enter or leave any of the retained public sections without passing over some portions of the lands that were granted to the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.527" offset="289520">The question before this Court is whether Congress reserved a legal and forcible right to enter and leave those 100 million acres of public lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.293" offset="336541">We submit that Congress' intent to reserve a right of access was manifest in the pattern and in the plan of the railroad grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.459" offset="373217">In the same way, as a private grant towards intention to reserve a right of access to lands that he retains when he makes a grant maybe implicit or manifest in the pattern of the grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.325" offset="424626">It was settled that common law that where a private grantor conveys away lands that completely surround another portion of lands that he retains.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.109" offset="459839">He is presumed or assumed to have reserved some right of access so that he can enter and leave that lands that he retained in order to make use of them.</text>

            <label>Ms. Sara Sun Beale</label>
            <text syncTime="102.047" offset="511561">Well, that's certainly true and one of the suggestions that the petitioners have made here is that perhaps Congress intended to first grant out these 100 million acres of land and then use the power of eminent domain in order to secure access to issued these checkerboard sections one by one.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.423" offset="585017">And we've suggested in our brief that it is inconceivable that Congress could have purposely intended to set up a pattern or a mechanism that would be -- that cumbersome and unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.907" offset="634964">It would have completely overpowered the state territorial and federal courts to have set up that kind of mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.197" offset="664116">And moreover, we can see from the history of the use of these grants that the Federal Government did not turnaround after making the grant and begin a concerted pattern of condemnation on these rights of way.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.070" offset="715630">So we think not only was that an unworkable way of gaining access to these lands but we find no evidence that that is what Congress either did intend in the legislative history and no evidence that that in fact is what occurred after the land grants were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.994" offset="779368">So although, it is true that Congress does that United States retained the right to use the power of eminent domain were necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.258" offset="812387">We think that that really does not provide the key to interpreting what Congress intent was when it made that checkerboard pattern of land grants.</text>

            <text syncTime="186.229" offset="848332">Mrs. Beale, I suppose it's well-established that the question of the construction of a federal grant is a federal question but what body of law does one turn to in deciding that federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.971" offset="907264">Is it a general common law of real property?</text>

            <text syncTime="204.886" offset="922937">Well, I think that that may provide some kind of basis for interpreting what Congress' intent is?</text>
            <text syncTime="211.863" offset="950836">Of course the general cases, teaching how to interpret the Acts applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.993" offset="979362">We would look to the legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.742" offset="986363">We would look to the administrative construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.900" offset="994931">And we might also look to the context in which the grants were made, the historical context.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.455" offset="1013217">And we might also look to the -- in doing now, we might look to the common law basis for land grants to see how one might interpret the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.047" offset="1055535">So I think all of those would provide a guide.</text>

            <text syncTime="255.283" offset="1124498">We are not claiming that there was a common law easement of necessity created when Congress made these grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.613" offset="1149785">What we are saying and this goes back to my prior answer you is that the assumption that underlies the common law rule about easements of necessity and that also plays a part in other kinds of implied easements about attempting to construe the intent of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.711" offset="1218226">And about what the grantor's intent must have been in this kind of circumstance is the guide here.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.995" offset="1243303">So we are not claiming a common law easement by necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.012" offset="1259395">What we are seeking to do is to ascertain the intent of Congress by looking to rules about common law easements by necessity and there are broader rules about easements by implications, so there are some differences.</text>

            <text syncTime="652.142" offset="2711907">Now, that's not the case here because of course the Leo Sheep Company and Palm Livestock Company have tailored grazing it permit and they do not require -- there having a problem of access.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.557" offset="2753599">But if they did, they could apply to the Secretary of Interior and get an easement in and out, if need be.</text>

            <text syncTime="694.348" offset="2880763">And indeed we think that that was as it -- this is a general matter quite true that the federal statutory provisions, the policies, the new provision are quite adequate and have been quite adequate to ensure that the grantee over the railroad have had access, and that's really not a problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1969.174" offset="7980074">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.899" offset="7995016">I'd like to make a couple of comments and then see if the Court has any questions with me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.458" offset="8017168">I thought that the counsel's analysis of the relationship between the odd and even-numbered sections provided an answer to a question Mr. Justice Blackmun put to me yesterday which is really what at stake in this controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.697" offset="8102118">Counsel says that the -- if the successors and enters to the odd-numbered sections, one access across the alternate even-numbered sections if still in public ownership they may seek a permit from the Secretary of Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.554" offset="8177560">There's nothing in the law that says that permit has to be granted or that it would be granted free of terms and conditions and restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.451" offset="8209220">If those lands have passed a private ownership by homesteading, counsel had made it very clear that the homestead had took a free title without any encumbrance upon if for the benefit of the alternate odd-numbered sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.199" offset="8268152">But if the United States either for access to the alternate even-numbered sections or for public access to a development such as Seminoe Reservoir wants to use the private lands of successors and enters of the railroad they can take that road without compensation, determine the size of the burden where the road will be located with the right in the landowner to either negotiate for some alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.583" offset="8409736">Or to go to Court and seek a determination that the easement is excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.938" offset="8463130">The landowner may have paid taxes upon the land subject to the taking of a road for an easement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.135" offset="8499911">I think if the Court would look at United States against Ridge -- Ringe in the Southern District of California cited on page 19 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.547" offset="8553514">We see the burden that's posed -- that's put on the ranching landowner of the Government exercising these rights of driving roadways or highways willy-nilly across ranch lands, breaking it up into parcels and destroying the utility of the land, now in the hands of purchasers for value based upon clear patents and a clear record title by examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.753" offset="8678379">If the Government has to go by con -- the condemnation route, it will have to pay not just for the small bits of land on corner crossings but it must -- going to have to address the impairment of value to the residual lands caused by the opening of unfenced public access routes across consolidated ranch areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.515" offset="8821426">This Court has said many times as cited on page 24 of petitioner's brief that a construction that others title securities should be limited to cases where there is a compelling need and that litigation should be avoided as a consequence of a construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.640" offset="8945977">Here we have a case where we have had a uniformed administrative construction for a 100 and now 16 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.219" offset="8988296">It's apparent that if the Court of Appeals decision is sustained, we're going to impose an encumbrance upon some a 131,000 acres that had been patented under language like Section 3 in this and other Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.684" offset="9070111">It's not illogically that we're also going to cloud a 100 million acres of title in these reserved even-numbered sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.117" offset="9107832">And as -- the Government has pointed out in our argument, we're going to have litigation over the size and burden of these rights of way.</text>
