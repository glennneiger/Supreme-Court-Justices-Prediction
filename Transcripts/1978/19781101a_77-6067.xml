            <text syncTime="135.381" offset="644890">The Missouri Court and the state here attempt to distinguish Taylor in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.086" offset="663698">First, that the effect of the Missouri system is different than the effect of the Taylor system. I will speak to that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.036" offset="699538">My co-counsel Professor Ginsburg will speak to the distinction the state makes with respect to the operation of the women's exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.660" offset="737991">The facts of this case speak strongly.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.043" offset="747499">Jackson County is 54% women.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.117" offset="763800">Voters -- the voter registration roles are used to pick the master jury wheel and we would assume that the voter registration roles through the statistics in our brief would mirror the population characteristic of 54%.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.812" offset="830568">Each year, the voter registrations roles are subjected to a random computer search which draws out 70,000 names.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.061" offset="863587">These names are then sent questionnaires to determine whether or not the 70,000 names meet Missouri's law as to eligibility for service.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.944" offset="903189">The questionnaire also contains the women's exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.712" offset="922206">The first question on the questionnaire is “State your sex” and parenthetically, “If you are a woman, and do not desire to serve, see the bottom of the page.”Missouri makes it very easy at this stage for women to opt off and they do in significant</text>
            <text syncTime="214.711" offset="962226">numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.610" offset="989811">This questionnaire procedure unquestionably causes the diminution from 54% women in the community to the panel which is 30% women, excuse me, the master jury wheel which is 30% women.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.949" offset="1055117">Our inquiry does not stop there however, because women are given a second opportunity to opt off juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.869" offset="1086882">Each week before trials, summonses are sent out.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.501" offset="1101406">These summonses compel only the attendants of men to serve on the juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.364" offset="1124812">The questionnaire in red -- excuse me, the summons in red states, “Women, if you do not desire to serve, contact the jury commissioner.”</text>
            <text syncTime="264.730" offset="1162324">The jury commissioner John Fitzgerald also testified that if women just ignored the summons, she would be deemed to have exercised her exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.902" offset="1199000">She was in Mr. Fitzgerald's words, “an excused female.” Men, however, their names, if they failed to appear would be -- their names would be sent to the bail for the presiding judge who would attempt to contact them.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.122" offset="1267858">These summons procedure is the only reason for the diminution between the master jury wheel which is 30% and the number of women appearing for trial week after week.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.882" offset="1490944">There are several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.937" offset="1495124">First, they didn't like the fact that we used 1970 population statistics which of course are the only statistics that are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.725" offset="1530232">They didn't like the fact that in the opinion that the master jury wheel count was as they said only an unverified pencil sketch.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.995" offset="1571401">Apparently, they forgot to read the transcript because there was testimony concerning the actual count of the jury wheel week after week after week prior to Billy Duren's trial, the panel's average 14.5% women.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.984" offset="1643290">They questioned the statistics but I believe the statistics in this case are in such a posture that we can reach the merits certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.391" offset="1684982">Further, a woman is again given an opportunity to opt off jury service even after she appears, even after she appears at any point before she has sworn as a juror, she can decide to go home.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.183" offset="1744123">Petitioner Billy Duren's jury panel in this case of 53 people with five women, there were almost ten times as many men on the jury panel as there were women.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.765" offset="1798457">Now, the state and the Missouri Supreme Court have said that these facts are not conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.852" offset="1834820">In some, what they want petitioner to do is to prove that there is no conceivable or even inconceivable reason which would cause this underrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.910" offset="1882990">As was noted in the amicus brief filed by the Solicitor General, the constitutional provision allowing women to opt off juries is the only possible explanation for the under-representation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1192.298" offset="4872547">The Court said in Taylor that is untenable to suggest it would be a special hardship for a woman to perform jury duty simply because of her sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.254" offset="4908387">Post Taylor then, a woman's work whether at home or on the job and the administrative convenience of treating all women as expendable, these are not even arguable basis for diminishing the defendant's Sixth Amendment right by diluting the quality of community judgment a jury trial provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.076" offset="4987695">Moreover, eliminating the exemption for any woman clouds no reasonable jury service exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.887" offset="5018937">Only two states, Missouri and Tennessee today maintain a solely sex-based exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.455" offset="5049240">Other Missouri exemptions are tied to occupation, prior service, individual hardship, not to an unalterable identification each of us is marked with at birth and identification bearing no necessary relationship to one's capacity or life situation and therefore inherently unreasonable as a basis for jury duty avoidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.065" offset="5143594">In some, no sense at all nourishes Missouri's solely sex-based exemption implemented by Jackson County's prominent invitations to any woman to sign off and the jury commissioner's assumption from a woman's inaction that she doesn't want to serve.</text>

            <text syncTime="1278.218" offset="5216214">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.808" offset="5218617">Surely not analysis or actual reflection accounts for an excuse based simply on a woman's sex and not on what she does or is capable of doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.016" offset="5263444">Finally, the Court's eight to one judgment in Taylor leaves no room for the Missouri argument that Billy Duren must show how he in particular might have been disadvantaged by a violation of the fair cross-section requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.948" offset="5323212">Selection of a criminal trial jury from a representative cross-section, the Court held in Taylor is an essential component of a defendant's Sixth Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.448" offset="5369187">Neither Missouri nor this Court is at liberty to apply or dispense with the cross-section rule based on the view of prosecutor or of judge of the strength of the evidence against a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.148" offset="5428015">Full respect for the cross-section command is required of the state because the constitutional safeguard is guaranteed to all and it may be relied upon by every person, the most low and the least deserving to the same extent as the most upright and virtuous.</text>

            <text syncTime="1531.351" offset="6228825">I think there are three issues that we have to address here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.946" offset="6239169">First of all, this Missouri's jury selection system systematically excludes women which I believe is what was held in Taylor versus Louisiana to be unconstitutional if it resulted in jury panels which are almost totally male.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.487" offset="6297370">I think we also have to find out what degree of disparity must be proven in order to make out a violation of the Sixth Amendment and I think there's also a question as to the allocation of the burden of proof in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.223" offset="6360273">I will first address the question as to whether Missouri's jury selection system systematically excludes women.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.480" offset="6397262">I think there is a distinct factual difference between our system and the Louisiana system and that in Louisiana, women were not included in the jury wheel unless they took affirmative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.470" offset="6445223">There was an assumption that they were not interested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.985" offset="6459329">In Missouri on the other hand, women are treated at the inception of the process in exactly the same way as are men.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.280" offset="6488482">The voter registration lists are used and names are selected at random from those list and questionnaires are sent out.</text>

            <text syncTime="1825.911" offset="7407052">And it is our belief that the figures in this case are sufficient to show that there was a fair cross-section of women on the community, on the panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.712" offset="7450206">We would point to the fact that there were 29% women on the master jury wheel even after women were given the opportunity to fill out the questionnaire and take their exemption there were still 29% women which is three times more than the situation in Taylor versus Louisiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="2154.514" offset="8721429">The Solicitor General would like this Court to say that there some kind of a prima facie case made out when you show a non-neutral selection process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.342" offset="8768763">And you show underrepresentation and they try to relate this to the situation in which this Court has found discrimination and exclusion of a particular group from a jury on the basis of a lower representation of that group and a non-neutral selection process a subjective selection process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.560" offset="8865625">And if shifted, the burden to the state, we submit that there is no reason to make such an allocation of the burden of proof in these cases because of the fact that the same situation is simply inapplicable here that is applicable in a discrimination case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.149" offset="8939917">When you're talking about trying to point at some place in a subjective process where discrimination has occurred, it is impossible for the defendant to go into that process and find out at what point that happens and therefore there is a reason for developing these rules about the prima facie case in shifting the burden of going forward with the evidence of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.761" offset="9030405">We submit that there is no similar reason here that there is nothing in our process which makes it easier for the state to show why it is not the exemption for women than it is for the defendant to show that it is the exemption for women that results in the underrepresentation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3123.669" offset="12598000">There is -- I don't know how many, there are seven I believe petitions for certiorari on this issue before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.828" offset="12626735">And I have nowhere near 150 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.928" offset="12639065">I'm not sure what the number is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.150" offset="12647946">But we believe as far as retroactivity that this case falls squarely under Taylor and that anyone who raised it prior to trial introduced evidence requested the court to quash the jury panel and give him a reasonably representative jury at trial should be afforded a new trial.</text>
