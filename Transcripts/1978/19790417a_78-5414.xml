            <label>Mr. Sidney Dickstein</label>
            <text syncTime="112.721" offset="554297">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.643" offset="561925">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.274" offset="580420">Petitioner in this case is Ilya Wolston who is the nephew of Jack and Myra Soble, admitted Soviet espionage agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.592" offset="633710">Following the Soble's arrest in 1957 in their later plea of guilty to espionage charges, Wolston received and failed to comply with the grand jury subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.285" offset="692537">Following commencement of the trial on the resulting contempt charge, Wolston pleaded guilty, received a one-year suspended sentence conditioned on his future cooperation with federal authorities and was placed on three years probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.327" offset="768711">Newspaper stories relating to Wolston's failure to appear in his contempt hearing, his plea and his sentence were published between July 15 and August 14, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.433" offset="825135">As the District Court observed however, Wolston had led a thoroughly private existence and was generally unknown until his failure to appear before the grand jury became public knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.662" offset="886053">And after the flurry of publicity attending his conviction ceased, he apparently succeeded for the most part in resuming his private ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.893" offset="942895">The defamatory statements at issue here are found in a book entitled KGB, the Secret Work of Soviet Agents, which was written by John Barron an employee of the Reader's Digest Association Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.178" offset="1012067">It was published in 1974 by Reader's Digest press and republished by two book clubs and in paperback by Bantam Books.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.271" offset="1060446">The defamatory statements on the book identified petitioner as a Soviet agent undifferentiated from the Rosenbergs, William Remington, Judith Coplon, Harry Gold, and other infamous figures of Soviet espionage.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.596" offset="1137768">A footnote to the identification of Wolston as a Soviet agent can be read to mean that petitioners -- petitioner had been indicted for espionage as well as convicted of contempt of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.967" offset="1215195">Following petitioner's filing of this action a diversity action in the District of Columbia, the author of KGB was deposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.012" offset="1259395">He testified that his identification of Wolston as a Soviet agent was predicated upon a 1960 FBI report --</text>

            <text syncTime="295.578" offset="1285726">Mr. Dickstein, could I ask you the same question I asked counsel in the case preceding, then the source of law is District of Columbia law?</text>

            <text syncTime="303.576" offset="1317700">The source of law in so far as federal issues are not concerned and is of course the District of Columbia.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sidney Dickstein</label>
            <text syncTime="312.677" offset="1354062">That is correct, it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.695" offset="1374124">Barron also testified that prior to and while he was writing KGB, he was completely familiar with the book entitled “My Ten Years as a Counterspy” which was written by Boris Morros and published in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.523" offset="1445491">In this book, Morros recounts that Soble has identified his nephew Wolston as “Slava” a person who would purportedly furnish Soble with information.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.263" offset="1500453">Morros' book referred to Wolston sentenced for contempt of court, but the book concluded that he knew nothing about Wolston's activities except that which Soble and I quote “a confirmed liar” had told him.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.572" offset="1589687">Barron testified that notwithstanding his authorization to invest as much time and research as necessary on the book, the full backing of the Reader's Digest organization, the assignment to him of a fulltime researcher, his use of the worldwide research facilities of the Reader's Digest and cooperation by the FBI and other federal agencies which had been assured and which he received.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.192" offset="1704103">In the over four years that this book was in preparation, he made no attempt to verify the information set out in the book concerning Wolston and relied he said solely on the FBI report.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.267" offset="1772440">With regard to the footnote reference in the book which the District Court and the Court of Appeals both agreed appear to state falsely that Wolston had been indicted for espionage.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.471" offset="1821236">Barron testified that he knew that Wolston had not been indicted, but that the persons to which the note refer, which included Wolston, had been convicted of espionage or falsifying information or perjury and/or contempt charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.413" offset="1889050">And that I take it meant Wolston following the espionage indictment of other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.359" offset="1924786">In support of the defendant's motion for summary judgment, Barron submitted an affidavit in which he says “I was confident upon publication of KGB that the book as a whole and each and every statement in it were true, and I was aware of no fact that tended to make me doubt the truth of the book or of any statement in it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="485.830" offset="2046725">He added that “At no time have I been aware of any fact that will give me reason to doubt the FBI report or any statement in it.”</text>

            <text syncTime="494.576" offset="2081625">Isn't it the rule on summary judgment that where a party defendant makes an affidavit that he's not only got -- you have right to depose him but that the District Court has to resolve issues against him if they are triable issues of fact?</text>

            <text syncTime="519.511" offset="2181413">In fact that is not the rule which appears to pertain in the District of Columbia where there is a special rule that deals with matters of summary -- deals with motions for summary judgment --</text>

            <label>Mr. Sidney Dickstein</label>
            <text syncTime="535.679" offset="2246092">It seems to have been suggested that the very existence, persistence if you would of a lawsuit which can otherwise be nipped in the bud at an early stage, has a chilling and inhibiting effect upon the press which is force to continue to defend that case from the normal processes of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.592" offset="2337729">And so, summary judgment is encouraged in the District of Columbia and in the Fifth Circuit as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.092" offset="2371688">That is the rule that was applied here, because as we think is evident from the record, and I refer to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.567" offset="2401677">If inferences were drawn which could fairly have been drawn, even if an actual malice standard were to have been applied, a jury could've concluded that Barron did entertain serious doubts about the truth of the allegation, the accusation that Wolston was a Soviet agent but went ahead and published anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.012" offset="2511391">The courts below did apply the actual malice standard here.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.637" offset="2533961">Purporting to follow this Court's opinions in Gertz and Firestone, they concluded that Wolston was a public figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.206" offset="2580146">And crediting Barron self-serving assertion, they concluded that malice could not be shown and granted summary judgment for the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.417" offset="2625076">It is from that summary judgment that we are before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="644.868" offset="2682859">That is correct precisely.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.496" offset="2701354">The basis for the conclusion of the courts below, that Wolston was a public figure subject to the actual malice standard, was that in failing to comply with the subpoena, he had voluntarily exposed himself to the publicity that might and did in fact ensue.</text>

            <text syncTime="671.514" offset="2789439">In your view, is the issue of whether or not a person is a public figure invariably a fact issue for a jury?</text>
            <text syncTime="689.612" offset="2861850">Or where would you put it in the range since you seem to suggest some special rules about First Amendment cases.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sidney Dickstein</label>
            <text syncTime="700.184" offset="2904064">Your Honor, we argued in the courts below that the question of whether one is or is not a public figure in a close case would be a question for a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.973" offset="2955264">We have not raised that here and we don't argue it here because we do not think this is a close case.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.509" offset="2981386">We think this is a case in which Wolston cannot be classified as a public figure and hence no fact issue arises which would give -- which a jury would have to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.902" offset="3031019">It is possible to postulate a case, to hypothesize a case in which an individual whose -- to whom public attention was drawn as a consequence of action which was contemptuous or in any other way in violation of the criminal law, could be said to have made a political statement by his conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.515" offset="3141465">One -- the case of a Hollywood Ten is brought to mind, where in their actions which were at one in the same time held to be in contempt of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.787" offset="3186500">It was clear that they were making political statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.538" offset="3205517">If it occurred that it was -- that there were fact issues and if were there ambiguities as to whether or not someone was a public figure under those circumstances, then possibly a jury question might be presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.763" offset="3262464">We do not think one is presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.699" offset="3286183">The reason why the courts below held that Wolston was a public figure beyond any question of a doubt, I suppose, was that they found in his actions the kind of voluntariness which this Court they said had in mind in Gertz.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.107" offset="3383777">Our reading of Gertz to the contrary was dismissed just too literal, too restrictive.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.635" offset="3409899">But we submit that the significant language of this Court's opinions dealing with public persons simply can not embrace petitioner Wolston.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.512" offset="3457442">He had no fame or notoriety of achievement.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.318" offset="3472593">Certain he occupied no rule of special prominence in the inference of society, nor did he attempt to influence society with respect to the outcome of public issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="940.665" offset="3865997">If one were a public figure in 1958, one would remain a public figure for the purpose of commenting upon those same events in a historical work published in 1974.</text>

            <text syncTime="2041.092" offset="8267734">I think the position taken by petitioner here is that to be a public figure it is not enough to have engaged in conduct attracting by its very nature attention and comments in a controversy, but to have desired the publicity as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.554" offset="8329592">That is I believe the nub of his theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.119" offset="8339832">Let's look at it from two standpoints.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.386" offset="8348923">The first is from a jurisprudential standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.178" offset="8364074">The determination of what a public figure's personal or subjective motive is, I would submit, a very dicey task at best.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.310" offset="8400645">A person who engages in criminal conduct to disrupt a government ceremony may have a whole panoply of whole motives, saddling the press with proving what the causative or primary motive was in engaging that conduct, I would submit does not promote the constitutional values involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="2099.292" offset="8500537">But I think here, I don't think that important distinctions in the measure of constitutional protection of free speech should turn on so supra in enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.327" offset="8544632">But let me take it to a different stage which is, let's look at it in terms of the two values or two interests accommodated by the public figure doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.067" offset="8587682">Now what this theory would require is dividing a class of libel plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.786" offset="8614536">All of whom took conduct which invited and attracted public attention and controversy and comment in a controversy into two subclasses which would depend on the method by which they use to affect the controversy or to attain the notoriety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.632" offset="8681932">So for example, the division would be between voluntary conduct which purposely seeks notoriety, and voluntary conduct which inevitably by its nature attracts notoriety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.751" offset="8730415">Between open advocacy of a particular results and conduct which inevitably affects or has that same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.467" offset="8773256">So Wolston here says in his brief that he will be a public figure if he had mounted a rostrum and argued against his grand jury appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.981" offset="8815261">But that he shouldn't be if he merely engaged in a contempt precluding his grand jury appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.322" offset="8836681">The first interest accommodated by the public figure doctrine is the public's need to know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.290" offset="8856534">How is that need to know any less in one case than in the other?</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.020" offset="8871476">The citizen in becoming informed about Soviet espionage has as much a need to know about someone such as Wolston who commits a contemptuous act precluding the grand jury from obtaining his testimony as it would about Wolston if he merely advocated against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.819" offset="8934693">Indeed the need in this case would be greater because he didn't just talk about it, he did something about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2223.758" offset="8998431">The libel plaintiff is equally damaged by all 20 of them, but if it's published with actual malice there can be recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.944" offset="9031137">If it's published without actual malice, there can't be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.705" offset="9042213">And yet the good name is equally tarnished regardless of the motive.</text>

            <text syncTime="2253.931" offset="9119117">But it's the public's need to know is the same as no reason to draw a line between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.820" offset="9142627">In fact the need to know is greater in the case where one speaks about pure conduct that in the case when one speaks about pure advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.685" offset="9178154">The other interest to be accommodated under the public figure standard is the reputational interests of the public figure, which are regarded as less than the wholly private person because he has committed conduct which has in created and enhanced likelihood of defamatory statements being made about him because he has invited indeed the very types of comments about which he now complains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.836" offset="9298735">Now, surely that's true whether Wolston mounts a rostrum to argue against his grand jury appearance as it would be if he in fact took contemptuous conduct precluding his grand jury appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.149" offset="9355995">In both instances to the same degree, the conduct creates an enhanced likelihood of defamatory statements.</text>

            <text syncTime="2686.961" offset="10851244">it may well be that a person who commits a criminal offense or allegedly commits one or somebody who resists his subpoena, loses any claim he may have to privacy with respect to publicity of that fact, publicity of emanating from his conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="3738.351" offset="15056750">Yes I do, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.462" offset="15085171">We would probably have a quite a different case here if Mr. Wolston had challenged the FBI's right to investigate into espionage or the right of the United States Government to issue a subpoena compelling his attendance before a grand jury conducting such an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.131" offset="15191855">But one thing is quite clear even on this abbreviated record and that is that the only justification, the only excuse that Mr. Wolston ever gave for not complying was his physical and mental condition at the time the subpoena was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.605" offset="15277746">He did not take a position in this public controversy with a view toward influencing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.707" offset="15306167">Indeed if one looks at the contemporaneous newspaper articles, they replete with references to; he refused to comment, he disappeared, he could not be reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.305" offset="15360606">And when you read the article concerning the event of the trial, it certainly appears as if the reason why he terminated the trial and plead guilty was because he wanted to resist any in further intrusion into his privacy and the privacy of his family.</text>

            <text syncTime="3867.903" offset="15575019">And then perhaps when extradition proceedings were started to get him back, he moved to some South American country that has no extradition treaty with the United States, and you have another series of stories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3879.230" offset="15620263">You think that might at some stage bring him into the public figure category?</text>

            <label>Mr. Sidney Dickstein</label>
            <text syncTime="3886.136" offset="15647953">Not as I understand the teaching of this Court's opinions in Gertz and Firestone, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3893.233" offset="15676270">We're not suggesting that this Court should assume that Wolston's actions were non-volitional for purposes of determining whether or not he was a public figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3908.365" offset="15736874">In fact, we're prepared to have the Court assume that they were volitional that he did not obey the subpoena and that he was properly plead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3924.183" offset="15800090">But that is not the kind of activity that we understand is spoken of in Gertz and in Firestone as to making him a public figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.822" offset="15854634">Mr. Buckley has asserted that this is a very evanescent proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3944.251" offset="15880338">How can the press expect to know what Wolston's state of mind was when he failed to obey the subpoena?</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.715" offset="15918268">We've never suggested that for one moment, but we have said is that there is not a scintilla, there was not a scintilla of indication that Wolston was refusing to obey a subpoena in order to have impact upon the processes, the controversy, the dispute in order to persuade the public of a position much like the analogy that I employed in my opening argument with respect with the Hollywood Ten.</text>
            <text syncTime="3989.790" offset="16062568">No guesswork was required here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.733" offset="16074271">But what if the standard that Mr. Buckley does advocate, he suggests that perhaps when someone has been convicted of a crime, some special things occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="4006.608" offset="16129755">At that point at least he becomes a public figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4011.838" offset="16150758">Well, if one thinks about guesswork in terms of assessing concrete facts then self-evident, what about the crystal balling that would be involved in application of such a standard?</text>
            <text syncTime="4027.472" offset="16213243">The press would rightfully complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.501" offset="16225364">How can we possibly know how much breathing space we have?</text>
            <text syncTime="4035.847" offset="16246784">How much room we have for error in commenting upon this man's conduct in the trial in his background if we have to wait until conviction and final judgment before we know whether or not and what we can say?</text>
            <text syncTime="4056.411" offset="16329017">Indeed, I dare suggest that given the criminal processes which fortunately have speeded somewhat in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.424" offset="16357021">In most instances, the statute of limitations are in libel in most jurisdictions would've run long before the press could fathom the extent of the room which has been allowed by such a standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4081.279" offset="16428492">To be sure, Mr. Wolston has been stripped of his privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4089.419" offset="16461093">But that does not mean that he is thereby to be made a subject of additional sanction at the behest of the Reader's Digest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4101.372" offset="16508844">Judge Cashin, 20 years ago decided what was an inappropriate sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4112.161" offset="16551999">With regard to the question of actual malice, and your questions Mr. Justice Rehnquist, if the actual malice standard was applicable here and we say it is not but if it were held to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4134.506" offset="16641442">The question would then be whether Barron had serious doubts about the truth of the statement that Wolston was a Soviet agent but went ahead and published it anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="4148.233" offset="16696299">Now less we be misunderstood, we are not suggesting and I answered before Mr. Justice Blackmun, that there is a varying standard depending upon the length of time that has occurred since the events which ostensibly are purportedly make up one a public figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4175.337" offset="16804760">We say the standard is the same but the manner in which that standard is to be applied is not rigid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4187.308" offset="16852616">It must take in a consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4191.871" offset="16870902">And particularly if one is going to ascribe to the balance, the accommodation of interest referred to in Gertz and predecessor opinions, one must take into consideration the circumstances of publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="4209.140" offset="16939969">And hence whether you're talking about actual malice or negligence or the minimal standard of fault permissible by Gertz, we think it completely appropriate that the trier of fact, the jury in this instance, have the opportunity to determine whether or not whatever standard of care is to be employed was employed under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4239.881" offset="17062849">When Barron testified, when Barron submitted an affidavit that he had no doubt whatever about any statement in his book, I submit that such extravagant overstatement should've been self-impeaching, instead it was fully credited.</text>
            <text syncTime="4260.951" offset="17147173">When he said “Yes, I knew about Morros' view of Soble's credibility that he was a confirmed liar, but I didn't rely upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.116" offset="17203806">I relied upon this FBI report and did the two put together create any doubt in my mind?”</text>

            <text syncTime="4347.374" offset="17492825">And the question was; what was his own self-assessment as to the extent to which he entertained doubts?</text>
            <text syncTime="4355.246" offset="17524381">The mere fact as he knew it that Wolston was in the grip of federal prosecutorial power and yet was never indicted for espionage should've said something to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4366.867" offset="17570879">All of these things, but what -- but Barron's testimony at deposition was not only extravagant and self-serving, some of it sounded like a lawyer's post litem inventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4381.771" offset="17630438">That in and of itself should've enabled us to challenge his credibility, this overbroad statement with respect to every proposition in his book being true, that should've been a basis for assessing his credibility, the fact that he saw no need to research despite the fact that he had these facilities.</text>
