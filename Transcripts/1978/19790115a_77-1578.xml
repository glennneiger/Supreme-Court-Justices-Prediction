            <text syncTime="18.122" offset="175835">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.465" offset="193181">I appear before the Court representing The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers and various of its writer and publisher defendants who were sued by CBS in the southern district of New York some eight years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.915" offset="246993">With me are Miss Amalya Kearse, who will be speaking for Broadcast Music, Incorporated and its various affiliated defendants and the honorable Frank Easterbrook, Deputy Solicitor General, who will present the government’s views.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.220" offset="304253">Miss Kearse, Mr. Easterbrook and I each have 15 minutes allotted to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.273" offset="324420">And from my part, I propose to endeavor to present my initial presentation in about ten minutes reserving some five for rebuttal if time permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.201" offset="368201">Now as the Court knows, this case is here pursuant to the grant of writ of a certiorari to the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.454" offset="401220">CBS having sued ASCAP and its various member defendants in BMI and its various affiliated defendants under the antitrust laws in late 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.978" offset="447300">The issue was quite simple then and it remains quite simple today.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.639" offset="465899">CBS claim that its television network needed to broadcast a good deal of copyrighted music and but it could not obtain the licenses for those copyrights in direct negotiations with the copyright proprietors.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.456" offset="529220">Therefore said CBS in its complaint it was compelled to take a blanket license from ASCAP and also from BMI.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.298" offset="564537">A blanket license as I think the Court is aware is one under which the user, the licensee has the right to use any or all of the compositions owned by all members of ASCAP and we have over 22,000 today and all of the more than 30 affiliated foreign societies around the world on whose behalf we license copyrights as often whenever with whatever frequency the user wishes and the user pays just one stipulated fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.188" offset="704136">For a television network like CBS I may say that fee has been running well under 1% of the gross receipts from sponsors with the network experiences.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.904" offset="750947">The compulsion of which it claimed –</text>

            <text syncTime="168.384" offset="776861">No Your Honor, in the licenses which we used as of 1969, it was a percentage, we thereafter with NBC and ABC went to stipulated dollar amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.391" offset="824926">With CBS, we have not had a license since 69.</text>

            <text syncTime="186.490" offset="849377">NBC has something over $4 million a year, ABC something less than that ABC since come on rather strong but they got us when they were weak.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="196.823" stopTime="200.107">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="196.823" offset="890650">The dollar figure for CBS, did you tell us that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jay H. Topkis</label>
            <text syncTime="200.107" offset="903816">The CBS Your Honor had settled with us in 1969 for five years as I recall it leading up to 69 and the average for those, it was one lump sum, sums were allocated to each of the years but the parties agree that, that would not be referred to in any Court proceedings so I prefer not to say that but the average was something over $4 million a year for CBS also.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.523" offset="989497">Now, the compulsion of which it complained said CBS violated the antitrust laws and all the usual ways we were accused of everything, block-booking, tying, price fixing, monopolization section 1, section 2, and the compulsions sprangs at CBS from two sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.056" offset="1067551">First, CBS complained that although it had never approached so much as one member of ASCAP seeking a direct license, CBS was sure that ASCAP’s members if CBS approached them would be disinclined to deal directly with CBS.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.552" offset="1141530">They would insist said CBS on dealing through ASCAP.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.051" offset="1159607">And second said CBS, there was no machinery by which CBS could obtain direct licenses for the compositions in the ASCAP repertory.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.493" offset="1201298">These were the central issues tried out as matters of fact before the District Court for eight solid weeks and in what the Second Circuit called a painstaking appraisal and analysis of the facts, Judge Lasker, the District Judge reviewed all of the evidence carefully and held against CBS as a matter of fact on every point.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.385" offset="1296906">He said that CBS had not established that ASCAP’s members would be disinclined to deal with CBS approach them, he said to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.567" offset="1333687">The evidence was that if CBS asked them, they would line-up at CBS’s door, anxious to deal, because after all what is their business, their business is selling their music and getting it exposed on national television for the benefit of the record sales and sheet music sales, which are promoted of course by network television exposure.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.250" offset="1416338">On the machinery issue, Judge Lasker said all CBS had to do was ask the machinery already existed or would spring into existence quickly if CBS only indicated its interest and so finding the District Court dismissed all of CBS’s claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.163" offset="1484048">I should note a most unusual aspect of this trial and I think it deserves emphasis.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.530" offset="1509543">CBS was not claiming the status of suffering victim, it did not claim that it had attempted to obtain direct licenses from ASCAP’s members or for that matter from BMI's members and then refused nor had it found that the machinery for direct licensing would not work, rather CBS's entire case was the product of speculation of conjecture.</text>

            <text syncTime="732.856" offset="3034781">Of the options that are opened to CBS or any other television network, they are seems to me of extraordinary range and extraordinary benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.091" offset="3087757">First, CBS has the right the District Court found as well as the ability to deal individually and get all the music it needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.870" offset="3118895">Second, if CBS wants to save the transactional costs and do without the bother and the trouble of dealing with individual members of ASCAP, it has the right to go to ASCAP and it can take its pick between a program license under which it pays only for each program that it broadcasts containing ASCAP music or a blanket license where its rights are absolutely unlimited.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.491" offset="3213354">And its options do not stop there because it has the right under the ASCAP amended final judgment in the Southern district of New York to have the court supervise negotiations between ASCAP and CBS so that if ASCAP attempts to obtain an unreasonable fee, the court is standing by to guarantee that there will be a reasonable fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.413" offset="3301021">This I think make CBS an economic entity having advantages that are just about unparalleled in our society.</text>

            <label>Ms. Amalya L. Kearse</label>
            <text syncTime="847.676" offset="3494118">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.536" offset="3509478">I represent Broadcast Music, Inc. which we refer to commonly as BMI.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.758" offset="3538422">We are here we believe on a simple question.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.586" offset="3557752">The question as decided by the Second Circuit is whether or not the offering of blanket licenses by BMI and ASCAP constitutes a per se violation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.936" offset="3615117">This question was presented to the Second Circuit by CBS as a question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.624" offset="3641866">CBS did not attack the findings of fact of the District Court, CBS urged the Court of Appeals not to make a rule of reason inquiry, CBS simply urged the Court of Appeals to find that as a matter of law, the offering of blanket licenses was per se illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.041" offset="3727548">The Court of Appeals did find that the offering of blanket licenses is per se illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.272" offset="3764433">The court did this despite the fact that it recognized that the offering of this kind of license is not a naked restraint, is not generally unlawful, is something that is required by some users, is something that is deemed very convenient by other users.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.590" offset="3841755">And as a result of the recognition of the values and the advantages of the availability of blanket licensing, the Court of Appeals despite the fact that it said blanket licensing is per se illegal, decided that the offering of blanket licenses should not be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.493" offset="3925347">I think the reason the Court of Appeals fell into the error of finding that blanket licensing is per se illegal is apparent from one particular passage in its opinion in which it says the availability of blanket licensing gives the copyright owner the right to choose the way in which his work will be licensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.969" offset="4047287">I say that is error because there is no support in the record for that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.624" offset="4065886">As Mr. Topkis has indicated, the record in this case is a bit unusual because we have CBS pressing its claim not on the basis of anything that has happened to CBS because CBS never attempted to get direct licenses from copyright owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.491" offset="4145298">The questioning a trial, the questioning on depositions was largely hypothetical; would you grant a direct license to CBS if it asked, what would happen CBS asked if we tried to go the direct licensing route?</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.092" offset="4215724">There was a fair amount of speculation from CBS's witnesses on this score but the speculation came from witnesses who had never talked to a writer or a publisher.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.957" offset="4255222">The great book of the testimony from knowledgeable people in the industry was that direct licensing would definitely be available as one of CBS's former vice presidents Mike then testified, the top composers and publishers are intensely eager to have their work performed and the average composer is out of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.389" offset="4344978">If you let them know you are interested, you won't be able to get them out of your office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.852" offset="4362742">And this is why the District Court found that the record was replete with the Darwinian imagery of cut through competition of publishers hungry for performances of their works and why he concluded, hyperbolically of course, but why he concluded that if CBS just let them know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.702" offset="4438183">The CBS was in the market for direct licenses, they would line-up at CBS's door.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.836" offset="4458768">And these findings were adopted by the Court of Appeals, which found that direct licenses are available, that there can be a market for direct licensing, that this market can co-exist with the offering of blanket licenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1132.423" offset="4633057">Approximately year and half before trial, CBS and BMI entered into a stipulation which provided in effect that with respect to the availability of direct licenses from BMI affiliates, CBS and BMI would be governed by what the District Court found with respect to the availability of direct licenses from ASCAP members and that --</text>

            <text syncTime="1806.920" offset="7331088">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.326" offset="7344671">The United States believes the three considerations govern the proper disposition of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.631" offset="7369853">First, under one circumstances should agreements among competitors beheld on lawful per se, second are the blanket licenses of ASCAP and BMI so likely to be add a competitive that they come within this class and third, if blanket licenses are not always unlawful, should a per se rule nonetheless be employed because of the particular circumstances of one user or class of users of music.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.416" offset="7497017">I will address those questions in turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.024" offset="7515512">My first proposition is that per se rules should be employed only when a particular species of conduct is so likely to be anticompetitive, that a particular trial of particular circumstances would not be worth of time and effort because there are so few justified examples of that species.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.041" offset="7603493">In those circumstances, there is no reason to go through a full trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.657" offset="7621987">Per se rules are attractive precisely because they are understandable and certain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.514" offset="7645393">They make compliance with the law simple, they make business counseling easy and they make trials short; they are thus highly desirables.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.757" offset="7686353">And the United States has consistently urged that per se rules be employed whenever that is feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.520" offset="7713416">But if certainty alone were enough to call for per se treatment, all of antitrust law would quickly be reduced to a series of harmonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.146" offset="7748002">There must be some reason for each rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.023" offset="7763466">When we say that certain conduct is so likely to be anticompetitive that we can omit particular inquiry, we are talking about antitrust and economic injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.935" offset="7807143">The court's focus has been on economic efficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.667" offset="7822085">When concerted conduct raises price, reduces the efficiency of production and decreases the amount of goods supplied, the consumer loses and he changes to vest desirable substitutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.300" offset="7880600">The prospect of earning especially high profits also induces firms to spend their time and resources gathering a monopoly and all of the resources used in this way are wasted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.631" offset="7929919">But the harming question is economic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.799" offset="7942562">Precisely because the harm is economic, the court has also considered economic benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.842" offset="7966699">Sometimes collaboration even between competitors yields new benefits, lower costs and so on.</text>

            <text syncTime="2001.234" offset="8108283">The United States believes that the possibility of monopolization what might be termed the Alcoa and United Shoe Machinery theory, was not explored as fully as it might have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.137" offset="8147884">It seems clear from the record in this case that there are limits on the effect that ASCAP could have on price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.799" offset="8174529">At some point, the price ASCAP charges becomes sufficiently high that it is best expensive for CBS or for anybody else to seek direct licenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="2031.582" offset="8229700">And so in that sense, it is clear from the record of this case that the price ASCAP is charging is less than the price that CBS would pay through direct licensing, assuming that CBS's behaving in a rational economic way.</text>

            <text syncTime="2166.198" offset="8768136">It does but that is also drawn from the record and from this Court's cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.223" offset="8788302">But my point was that there are some forms of collaboration between competitors that are undoubtedly beneficial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.380" offset="8820903">The formation of new firms, the mergers between existing firms, and the creation of a joint ventures, all involve competitors or potential competitors who cooperate in someway or other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.474" offset="8865311">It is precisely because of these forms of economic cooperation without which one could not have a corporation or indeed much of any other economic enterprise are beneficial to the economy but the court has been hesitant to apply per se rules to economic cooperation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.479" offset="8929259">The basic distinction I am suggesting in the formulation of per se rules is the one recognized by Judge Taft in his famous opinion in Addyston Pipe &amp; Steel and an important foundation of antitrust law between naked restraints and economic integration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.233" offset="8988296">Naked restraints between competitors rarely produce economic benefits and because they sometimes cause loss they are deemed unlawful per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.615" offset="9021837">Forms of economic integration on the other hand although they contain the potential for economic laws, also contain a great potential for gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.053" offset="9059558">And that brings to me my second proposition, which is that ASCAP is not a naked restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.932" offset="9083068">ASCAP is clearly a form of joint venture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.996" offset="9095398">As a rule, blanket licenses issued by ASCAP produced real benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.439" offset="9117132">A blanket license is a product that only a joint venture can sell, no composer, no small combination of composers can sell what ASCAP sells.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.475" offset="9157256">What ASCAP sells is the right to use great quantities of music on the spur of the moment without searching for a composer, without negotiating for a contract and without fear of infringing anyone's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.494" offset="9209396">Users of music apparently find that package of rights valuable, if only because the cost of searching for a composer and negotiating a contract in many cases exceeds the total value of the music.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.954" offset="9259238">The figures given by CBS at page 22, first note of its brief, disclosed the cause of negotiating composition by composition through an agency and they run from $5-up per composition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.851" offset="9318797">For many uses of music, radio, bars, and the like, the total value was significantly less than $5 and without some form of license of the sort ASCAP offers, those transactions would never take place at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2339.229" offset="9460276">The blanket license is beneficial to music users and its economic value rather than any arguments about market necessity makes per se treatment inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.993" offset="9503326">To say a CBS does that ASCAP is unlawful per se because it fixes a price is to make antitrust law depend on tautologies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.326" offset="9544704">Of course, ASCAP fixes a price, it must fix a price, every firm, every joint venture sets a price for the thing it makes and the members of the firm or the joint venture do not compete against each other within the firm to sell the thing they make at a lower price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.215" offset="9612204">There is no competition in the sale of ASCAP licenses because only ASCAP makes ASCAP licenses and similarly there is no competition in the sale of BMI licenses, there is also no competition in the sale only Schick Razors, because only Schick make Schick Razors, that is a trivial argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.931" offset="9675107">The important question is whether there is competition in the sale of performing rights, not whether the joint venture is trying to compete against itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.999" offset="9711365">On that score, ASCAP and BMI have very little in common with price fixing cartels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.899" offset="9738951">A cartel tries to drive up prices by curtailing supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.900" offset="9754937">Here there is not curtailment indeed because of the low price under the blanket license it may be that there is too much music use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.332" offset="9784717">A cartel tries to stop competition among its members or at least stay agree not to compete with one another individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.046" offset="9811571">There is no such agreement here and it seems conceded and the District Court found that they would lineup at CBS's door if they were asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.632" offset="9849919">So my argument so for has been that blanket licenses produce economic benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.824" offset="9874683">The per se rule does not apply to them precisely because joint venture of this sort offering a product of this sort have some economic utility.</text>

            <text syncTime="2502.506" offset="10113442">Reason for that not necessarily the Warner episode but the reason in general if one publishing company showed up is that under the ASCAP blanket license, CBS has the right to use those compositions at zero marginal cost, they won't pay additionally for them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2824.453" offset="11401174">I represent CBS, the plaintiff in this case and the respondent on this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.638" offset="11417893">The principal issue on this appeal is the correctness of the Court of Appeals' determination that defendant's fixed prices or more specifically, whether a combination of otherwise competing music publishing corporations are fixing prices in violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act, when the prices at which they sell music performance rights for television network use are not determined by a process of price competition but are determined set by the combination itself and are indeed annual single package prices to approve of all the members' copyrights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.759" offset="11558431">By law, copyrights on original musical compositions are granted to the composers of those compositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.400" offset="11584972">As a matter of practice, those copyrights are sold to the music publishing corporations and the licensing of music rights to motion picture producers to the makers of phonograph records and to the publishers of sheet music.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.418" offset="11657070">Music publishing corporations do deal directly with those users and do engage in price competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.740" offset="11690297">And the licensing of performance rights for television network use such as CBS music publishing corporations manage to sell in a thoroughly noncompetitive way as in so far as price is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.948" offset="11747140">How do they do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.712" offset="11754245">By a formally structured, controlled and pervasive system than any ordinary price fixing arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.717" offset="11782248">In the routine price fixing case, it is common to find that the sellers have gotten together not uncommonly in a hotel room and it either by explicit agreement or by some well placed words and some winks and may be some nuts have agreed to set price at may be a $1,000 a unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.536" offset="11853511">Quite really, will any of those sellers leaving that room actually sell at a $1,000 a unit?</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.485" offset="11877334">They will negotiate down from that price but it will be a focal point for negotiations and such an arrangement is obviously illegal per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.770" offset="11910457">Here, the music publishing corporations do not agree to sell individually at a $1,000 a use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.976" offset="11935326">They agree to have a central instrumentality, a joint sales agency ASCAP or BMI, sell a blanket license to their entire pool of copyrights at ‘X' million dollars a year and then to distribute $1,000 to themselves in respective each use the licensee makes of their music.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.541" offset="12013484">Now, this quite obviously is a very effective means of eliminating price competition among otherwise competing sellers of removing --</text>

            <text syncTime="4351.021" offset="17507453">The reality is in purpose in effect in the first place, we got to look at who the music publishing corporations that populate the ASCAP Board year after year or who are they that accept these blanket licensing fees, they are Warner Brothers and they are Twentieth Century Fox and they are MCA Universal and Paramount, which as all we know subsidiary of Gulf and Western United Artists, subsidiary of Transamerica and Chappell Music and Sherman Music, a pair of (Inaudible) like a hardcore of the old line music publishing corporations which control the standard compositions that are used often on television networks.</text>

            <text syncTime="4395.178" offset="17684041">The purpose of this combination that it is to maintain prices, I submit that there is not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4400.914" offset="17707029">The very counterclaim in this case flatly states that CBS has attempted to enjoin the blanket licensing system is part of plan designed to press the price paid for music performance rights and if their purpose in opposing the elimination of the blanket licensing system is to avoid a depression of the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="4422.080" offset="17791666">Their purpose in maintaining the blanket licensing system is obviously to maintain the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="4427.075" offset="17811623">In other words, this argument by the ASCAP defendants is subsequently identical to the argument made by the society of professional engineers that competitive bidding would pressure price reductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.506" offset="17857390">It is as clear an admission of any competitive purpose as one could possibly fine and it is far familiar one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4445.466" offset="17885288">We have cited rather large collection in our brief, such as the speech given by ASCAP's president some years ago that the central purpose of ASCAP and the Writers Guild and similar organizations was to resist the splitting of all rights so that we could be picked of one by one, or the testimony given in this case by ASCAP's Board member and officer Mr. Brettler, who is also the head of Shapiro Bernstein Publishing Company, that the benefits of hiring the ASCAP which he describe as a legal monopoly where that in unity there is strength and added disunity, there is weakness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4479.257" offset="18020394">And the record is filled for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4480.958" offset="18027186">And just as reveling our defendant's intention to maintain prices to the blanket licensing system are these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4487.659" offset="18054040">ASCAP pays out to its members on a per use basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4491.980" offset="18071280">IE, it pays its members a $1,000 for every future use of their music on the television network, but ASCAP refuses to take in on a per use basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4500.974" offset="18107225">IE refuses to charge in that network separately for each use.</text>
            <text syncTime="4505.951" offset="18127182">Is blanket licensing therefore are necessarily restrictive and deliberately so and is deliberately designed to preclude price competition, of course it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4515.967" offset="18167202">The blanket license is an all or nothing deal, either you take the entire pool or you get nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4521.852" offset="18190817">That means if you take the entire pool that direct licensing is obviously silly because then he was going to pay twice from the same user.</text>
            <text syncTime="4528.910" offset="18219029">If ASCAP agree to take in on a per use basis that would mean that the program packagers, the people who make the television programs and sell them to CBS could immediately start direct licensing for the preponderance of the composition they use, both music written originally for television by their own staff writers and publish music and get some form of price competition going at once and so can CBS for relatively few programs that it make itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="4730.475" offset="19025272">Now, the reason I think that and there is lots in the record to support this, is that if you start with a per-use system, that means ASCAP will be – that music will be available from ASCAP, whatever the Court sets as a price, ‘x dollars' a use, so the court may not set the price until he sees what the prices are in direct licensing transaction and gear the per-use price of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4756.368" offset="19128822">But whatever that price is set, that will be the amount of money for which per-use you can get music from ASCAP.</text>
            <text syncTime="4764.782" offset="19162467">On the other hand, you can also deal directly with Music Publishing Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.442" offset="19177096">Now, to get to a per-use system, obviously there must be a declaration in this case (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="4774.326" offset="19200711">That declaration coupled with the inauguration of the per-use system is going to renounce the music publishing world as it must that blanket licensing is over, there is no further possibility of blanket licensing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4788.227" offset="19256299">They will have no choice whatever, let me sure of a boycott, they will have no choice whatever then for the first time to create the direct licensing facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4799.121" offset="19299871">We have got to recognize that we are dealing with the music publishing industry that lacks the personnel, the established operating procedures, any of the forms, any of the consents they are going to have to have from their writers to engage in direct licensing, none of that is in existence, none of that is in place.</text>

            <text syncTime="4849.038" offset="19499551">(Inaudible) that he found that from the time that CBS announced its intention to engage in direct licensing and he also said that there would be inauguration of direct licensing facilities until CBS made that announcement.</text>

            <text syncTime="4873.599" offset="19597772">Now, he also suggested to us, a lot of phrase that we might do during the process of that year, we might require the movie companies who make our programs to call a flop, the catalogs and their music publishing subsidiaries that presumably on threat that their production services would not be agree with favor by CBS unless they did that, he suggest we go out and get many blanket licenses which are probably tieing on this Court's decision in Leibovitz and Paramount.</text>
            <text syncTime="4906.647" offset="19729951">He suggested we do a lot of other things.</text>

            <text syncTime="4923.064" offset="19795675">After we recognize that, that customer if he wanted to nominate one engineer and get his price and then resume that relationship and nominate an other engineer and so forth, could get himself access eventually into a competitive market, but here we are dealing with a far bigger problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4939.039" offset="19859519">And we got to at least expend all these efforts and takeover these risks and by all these options, which Your Honor referred to before and all economists in this case agree, we would have to pay for those options and pay duly.</text>

            <text syncTime="4955.702" offset="19926183">And I just do not think that the antitrust laws are required in it, and bear in mind that professional engineers' case was not a case in which the engineers had agreed on the prices that they would sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="4966.200" offset="19968188">Here is a case in which otherwise competing sellers are agreeing on the price which they would sell and there is no possibility if we went through this rigamarole and if we did pay the penalties on music in the can.</text>

            <text syncTime="4984.778" offset="20042480">Every ASCAP publisher knows, every time he sees a piece of his music being used on CBS that is a $1000 in his pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="4993.260" offset="20076440">If we abandon all ASCAP license and if we try to license directly, the first place he is going to start, his first frame of reference is going to be a $1000 a use.</text>
            <text syncTime="5005.401" offset="20125027">We have plenty of testimony in this case about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5007.833" offset="20134745">It is an admitted fact; you see that in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5009.946" offset="20143208">ASACAP is saying now in their reply brief, well, you may be right, what so wrong with that, why is that any different from what in the other seller in ordinary market does, takes in account prior prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="5022.596" offset="20193782">But here we are talking about not the influence of the sellers own prior prices, not the influence of competitive market prices, we are talking about the influence of a consortium price, where price has been agreed upon and that is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="5038.959" offset="20259192">On that effect, this is ineluctable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5042.414" offset="20272985">Now the Court of Appeals said it was not persuaded that, that effect would occur and I suggest that, that was an error of logic and economics.</text>
            <text syncTime="5052.695" offset="20314154">This was an admitted point by economists of the parties themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="5056.962" offset="20331186">And once you -- and it is an obvious point, and once you have get a stabilization effect like that injected into a market, it does not go away, unless you can reduce the price to zero and that does an exist outside of some pathological economic text book model.</text>

            <text syncTime="5201.511" offset="20909432">And 27 out of 35, he said dealt, well, and he said eight did not deal, and even that is wrong, it was nine that refused to deal, not eight.</text>
            <text syncTime="5211.553" offset="20949556">And when you compare the publishers who refused to deal, the nine, who by ASCAP's credit system account for 40% of CBS users and I say ASCAP's credit system, you can evaluate music in terms of equal numbers of compositions because some music is more liable than other music and the credit system of ASCAP does that, so that is probably the best way we have right now of evaluating uses the nine who refused to deal supply 40% of CBS's uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5246.603" offset="21089782">The 27 or 26, whatever the number was, who did deal are at the minimis percentage, the total of them was 3.5%.</text>

            <text syncTime="5362.660" offset="21554030">And the sync right and performance right is licensed in one transaction and the license use at a time, that is a sensible way to license music.</text>
            <text syncTime="5371.444" offset="21589138">I think in the short time I have remaining, I would like to jump to the rule of reason point and mainly to make the point that the Court of Appeals really decided this case on rule of reason grounds as well as per se grounds, that is not the label that the court used, but that is obviously what it did and in addition to holding this former price fixing to be per se illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5397.459" offset="21693210">The Court of Appeals looked to see whether this price fixing was necessary for any market functioning purpose and found that it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5404.956" offset="21723199">The Court of Appeals looked to see whether the system created a disinclination to compete and found that it did inevitability.</text>
            <text syncTime="5411.495" offset="21749321">The Court of Appeals looked to see whether there was a less restrictive alternative and found that there was, the per-use system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5417.745" offset="21774399">And all of these were rule of reason determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5421.111" offset="21787773">And this was obviously the basis of judge Morris concurrence, which defendants suggest was irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="5431.504" offset="21829360">Moreover, there is nothing of cognizable economic value that this unnecessarily restrictive system can be said to provide that would not be better provided by a competitive market.</text>
            <text syncTime="5443.297" offset="21876590">All we have really heard and it is not really a rule of reason consideration is that CBS is too big, to be permitted to deal one-on-one with Aarom Copland or George Gershwin or the write of several songs, but CBS will not be dealing with Aarom Copland even to the limited extend CBS is producing its own programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5461.359" offset="21948792">The independent packagers will be dealing with them as they now deal with authors and actors and scenery designers and set designers and everybody else, who supplies elements for television program except ASCAP supplied music.</text>
            <text syncTime="5477.662" offset="22013994">And as I said before, the people who write music for television get between a $1,000 and $ 2,500 a week, so there is plenty of those people who have adequate bargaining card.</text>
            <text syncTime="5494.797" offset="22082539">I guess the last point I want to turn to is defendant's expressed concern in their brief for troubled damage liability if this judgment is affirmed, that to obviously is something to do with the rule of reason determination, but it should be -- but I think also it has not very little to do with this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5513.441" offset="22157145">CBS has not saw damages in this case, troubled or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="5516.932" offset="22171146">The television stations are recently sued in New York and they have not saw damages either.</text>
            <text syncTime="5521.342" offset="22188701">And if any group of users sue and if they do seek damages and this Court believes for any reason that these music publishing corporation should not pay damages, this Court has the inherent powers to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="5532.512" offset="22233422">So this case will not decide the question of whether music publishing corporations must pay damages, what it should decide I submit is that price fixing is unlawful whether committed or something as beloved as a popular tune or on any other right commodity or service.</text>

            <text syncTime="5653.083" offset="22715747">The fact is that today, the Columbia Television System Network holds no license whatsoever from ASCAP in order so far as I am aware from any ASCAP member.</text>
            <text syncTime="5663.647" offset="22757961">It canceled the license it held with us many months ago, shortly after the Second Circuit came down with its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5671.855" offset="22790771">It has been playing the ASCAP music constantly ever since that cancellation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5678.461" offset="22817207">It has paid neither ASCAP nor anybody else one dime for the exploitation of copyrights in which it has engaged and it has merrily told us that if we bring a suite for infringement on behalf of any our members, it will defend what they claim that we have misused our copyrights and so it is immune against any claim for infringement we are not privileged to enforce our copyrights.</text>

            <text syncTime="5718.136" offset="22975927">Now, that causes me to plead with perhaps special vigor for this Court if it agrees with us that there has been no per se violation of law, not to remand this eight year-old case for further enquiry or further trial or further anything else, but since the District Court found that CBS had failed totally in every assertion of fact that it made, we submit that the proper course is to end matters here and in effect to serve notice on the world that antitrust litigation really is not and will not be tolerated by this Court to be endless.</text>
