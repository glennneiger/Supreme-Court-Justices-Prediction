            <text syncTime="21.401" offset="189001">This case involves the application of presumptions of intent in order to extrapolate a judgment of system-wide liability in the imposition of a system-wide racial balance remedy from conduct where a system-wide racial balance remedy is not warranted by the incremental segregative effects of the identified constitutional violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.719" offset="298297">I wish to make at the outset a brief statement, an overview of the Columbus public school system in the remedy that the Court ordered in this matter before I go to a discussion of the specific errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.325" offset="360678">And, initially, I would like to point out that the Ohio State Board of Education was a party below and has filed a brief concurring with the petitioners' view and their position is fully supportive of ours and we in turn are supportive of what they have to say and we recommend that brief to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.815" offset="458585">The Columbus public school system is the fourteenth largest city school system in the United States and like most school systems during the ‘50s and ‘60s.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.943" offset="507173">It went through an enormous period of growth.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.775" offset="522428">In 1950, it had a school enrolment of about 46,000 students.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.142" offset="543953">It grew to 1971 of -- to about 110,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.574" offset="565687">At the same time, its area increased from some 45 square miles to 170 square miles, one of the largest growths that took place anywhere in this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="142.932" offset="675088">They didn't have to follow each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.372" offset="684910">They are for the most part however, particularly since the Ohio Supreme Court in 1956 ordered -- approved a transfer of a number of pieces to the City of Columbus that had been authorized by the Ohio State Board of Education, so that they are at this time for the most part contiguous but not entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.456" offset="777174">During this period of time, the school system added 103 school buildings and they added 145 additions to various facilities, some old and some that were build during that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.851" offset="842794">So that, at the time of trial, the system consisted of 170 school buildings with 97,000 students, 67 -- approximately 67% white and approximately 32% non-white.</text>

            <text syncTime="231.306" offset="1028577">In the early ‘70s or the late ‘60s, the Columbus public school system set out on a system that was in design to bring about voluntary integration of its school system and it entered into what it refers to and what is described in the court's opinion as the Columbus plan racial transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.527" offset="1105481">They also set about a program of magnet and alternative schools, a series of career centers that are located throughout the system, and they attempted to what -- new attendants areas to improve racial balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.212" offset="1164204">All of these things were expanded each year during the 1970s.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.419" offset="1189073">And although the racial -- there is not racial balance within the Columbus public school system or was not at the time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.243" offset="1224391">All -- virtually all schools were racially mixed and the balance within the schools of Columbus, their racial balance was superior or a better balanced than that which existed within the residential patterns of the City of Columbus at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.575" offset="1301713">All schools at the time of trial had balanced faculties.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.439" offset="1329089">On March 8, 1977, the District Court found that the entire Columbus public school system was unlawfully segregated and based on this general conclusion of system-wide liability and without determining the incremental segregative effect ordered a system-wide racial balance remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.227" offset="1412263">And they did this in spite of the fact that they had determined at the same time that it would not have been possible to have had within the public school system of Columbus without any act of unconstitutional conduct, a racially balanced system, and that is part of the lower court's finding.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="347.649" offset="1493974">Mr. Porter, don't you think that the District Court's findings are pretty well-insulated from review by the language from Judge Edward's opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in this case which is at page 199 of the petition where he says if the detailed findings in this paragraph tracking the language of the date and case, and he's referring to the District Court's postdated opinion, cannot appropriately be implied from the District Judge's post datement-- date and opinion, and we think they can and should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.760" offset="1630438">We now enter these findings as the findings of this Court based upon the 6,600 pages of evidence in the record made before the District Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel H. Porter</label>
            <text syncTime="390.944" offset="1667114">If the question, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and I'm not sure that I understand it, if it -- if the question is, “Is that an appropriate finding of system-wide liability by the Court of Appeals?” It is our position that it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.563" offset="1713612">If the question is, “Are we raising at this time or attacking the findings by the District Court with respect to specific violations?”</text>
            <text syncTime="412.524" offset="1753422">No, we are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.341" offset="1756766">We are assuming that those findings were correct that what our position is that they were isolated findings and that they cannot support a system-wide remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.829" offset="1794696">And we go further and say that the Sixth Circuit -- that Judge Edwards cannot overcome the failure to make specific findings simply by making the statement that he does make.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.368" offset="1840880">We believe that he is required under the date and case to make specific findings of fact and then determine the incremental segregative effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.481" offset="1909321">The order that the District Court -- the order of desegregation which the District Court approved ordered the reassignment of some 42,000 school children, it ordered the transportation for a racial balance of 37,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.733" offset="1994271">It required the purchase of some 213 buses with an -- with using those buses plus the old fleet, it requires four starting times and four ending times during the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.873" offset="2050905">And this was done as I said, even though the Court had found that if the Columbus system had never acted improperly, the racial balance would not be accurately reflected within the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.261" offset="2104404">If it -- the District Court recognized in their -- his March 8, 1976 opinion -- 1977 opinion that racial balance -- imbalance was due to the residential patterns within the City of Columbus.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.657" offset="2170023">We believe that the question that they presented here is where there is no history of absolute segregation whether compelled by statute or otherwise, and the system serves urban areas with large and highly concentrated black population where there is substantial residential segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.318" offset="2248600">Can you, under those circumstances, use standards and presumptions in order to arrive at a system-wide remedy?</text>
            <text syncTime="547.078" offset="2291649">The first and most obvious error, was that the court -- lower courts failed to determine the current incremental segregative effect in the manner required by Dayton I.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.851" offset="2338774">The second was that lower courts concluded that Columbus was a dual system through the improper use of legal presumptions and shifting burdens of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.379" offset="2384854">And third, the lower court applied an erroneous standard for determining segregative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.219" offset="2420276">We believe that Dayton I sets forth the required approach that federal courts must take in the trial of school desegregation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.014" offset="2463431">Thus, the first step is to make a factual determination whether there were specific instances where the School Board attended to and did in fact discriminate against minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.905" offset="2514944">And if such constitutional violations are ascertained, then the court must determine the current incremental segregative effect of these violations have had on the present racial school population.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.686" offset="2578160">The incremental effect is to be measured by comparing the present racial distribution in the schools to what it would've been if the constitutional violations had not occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="1410.821" offset="5746604">If one will look at our brief for example, there are some 13 high schools in existence at that time half of which were within the plus or minus 15% of the racial balance requirement of Judge Duncan, half of the Columbus public school high schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.660" offset="5817971">And several of them are within a point or two and it is our position that under those circumstances you do not have a dual school system and you cannot use simply the phrase, “You have system-wide liability, dual school system is a jumping off point for ordering the reassignment of 42,000 people.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.626" offset="5897906">And we think that Dayton is correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1465.931" offset="5967078">It deals with violation and there was no finding of a substantial effect on the Columbus public school system in 1976 of any violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.641" offset="6025906">And it is our view that under those circumstances that the District Court should not have ordered the remedy that he ordered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1571.263" offset="6388381">I would like to conclude simply by asking this Court or pointing out to the court, I guess more accurately, that in Ohio there are about six school cases going on: Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, Cincinnati, Akron, Youngstown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.377" offset="6496841">They're in various stages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.525" offset="6505514">Several have been tried.</text>

            <text syncTime="1608.335" offset="6536756">And we think that before a school system which is insolvent is asked to go through massive relocations and massive reassignments that there should be -- the District Court should be required to make very definite specific findings and they should be required to make the type of inquiry that Dayton I calls for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.390" offset="6660890">If it isn't Dayton I, with all due respect, then it should be something else but it should not be sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.421" offset="6689102">It should not be sufficient to simply say in broad generalities that a condition exists, you go out and remedy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.213" offset="6720240">There are many, many, many remedies, some of which look to racial balancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.993" offset="6751378">This remedy was obviously of racial balance, was the only thing considered by the District Court and it was the only thing considered by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.513" offset="6789413">And we would suggest that it is inappropriate and that in order to deal with this type of situation at least in the State of Ohio, specific instructions from this Court as to what the trial courts should do and the type of findings that they should make, we would suggest to this Court would be very helpful.</text>

            <text syncTime="1705.659" offset="6925981">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.888" offset="6946879">I would like to begin by simply stating what the respondents seek from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.218" offset="6984286">We ask that this Court sustain the finding made by the District Court below and the Court of Appeals that indeed under the controlling legal principles here before announced, a dual system existed in Columbus at the time of the Brown decision from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.853" offset="7066833">And that the existence of that dual system imposed an affirmative duty under Green and we ask this Court on its review of the record as the District Court below and the Court of Appeals below to find default by the local officials in carrying that affirmative responsibility a failure to dismantle the dual system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.551" offset="7165576">We ask this Court to reject the petitioners' preposition that you can treat a system-wide cancer such as segregation with a band aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.218" offset="7216253">And instead to remain true to its holdings in Brown, in Green, in Swann, in Keyes, in Milliken, and we believe in Dayton that where a system-wide violation has been shown to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.609" offset="7313847">Only a system-wide remedy is capable of correcting the condition that offends the constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1810.376" offset="7344880">Mr. Atkins, you speak of the court remaining true to its teachings in Dayton and I'd like to ask you about a finding of Judge Duncan and then ask you about some language from Dayton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.315" offset="7400678">On page 58 of the appendix in Judge Duncan's opinion, he says in the middle paragraph there, “The interaction of housing in the schools operates to promote segregation in each.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.930" offset="7467133">It is not now possible to isolate these factors and draw a picture of what Columbus schools or housing would've look like today without the other's influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.762" offset="7510392">I do not believe that such an attempt is required.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.721" offset="7526275">And then, compare that with our language in Dayton, “If violations are found, the District Court and the Court of Appeals must determine how much incremental segregative effect these violations had on the racial distribution of the Dayton school population is presently constituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.396" offset="7620942">And when that distribution is compared to what it would've been in the absence of such constitutional violations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.791" offset="7654588">Don't you detect some inconsistency there?</text>

            <text syncTime="1894.515" offset="7681442">I read page 58 of the District Court's opinion to be simply another way of saying what this Court said in Swann in addressing the question of the permissible scope of transportation as the remedial implement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.587" offset="7749674">And it said we cannot precisely define for every case how much will be permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.989" offset="7787290">It is not possible to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.475" offset="7793246">The District Court after sitting through a trial with 70 witnesses over 700 exhibits and nearly 7,000 pages of transcript said, “What I have seen on the basis of the entire record before me is segregative intent specifically carried out through active -- actions of the public officials with an impact which is system-wide in scope.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.760" offset="7910379">Here, he speaks specifically to the interaction between the school segregation these petitioners caused and the housing segregation in the neighborhoods around the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.023" offset="7959489">He says here, as he does in other points throughout his opinion, “Far from the schools being segregated, because the neighborhoods were segregated, the neighborhoods are in part segregated because they segregated the schools.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.896" offset="8018944">I don't find any inconsistency here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.754" offset="8030438">And in this Court's teaching in Dayton where it calls for the most careful kind of scrutiny of the violations being urged upon the District Court by whoever comes to it seeking relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.938" offset="8083101">We believe and we think the record shows that the District Court was very, very careful in evaluating that record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.764" offset="8114448">It fully credit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.500" offset="8121344">The evidence offered by the defendants, it examined it carefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.867" offset="8142869">It made in many instances, as they have cited statements about that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.289" offset="8164498">It found by the clear convincing weight of all of the evidence before it, including their evidence, that there was system-wide segregation and that the segregation was not adventitious.</text>

            <text syncTime="2037.373" offset="8252897">It certainly wasn't the sort of system that you had in many southern states at the time of Brown I where races were forbidden to attend the same school by law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2048.453" offset="8297200">I think the court recognized, as this Court did in Keyes, that state action can take place either by the passage of a law in a legislature or by the action of a school official imbued with the power of the state constitution and legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.293" offset="8364596">It found in this case as in Keyes, that the state action which offended the constitution were the specific policies which pre-1954 created the five black schools overnight in several instances which had a specific policy of assigning all the black faculty only to the black schools which as my brother counsel fails to point out to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.967" offset="8479222">When this Court found construction violations that created a black school, it was also a finding as this Court has noted, a reciprocal effect necessarily upon the white schools whose boundaries were changed to accommodate the warehouse being built for black students.</text>

            <text syncTime="2191.490" offset="8869282">Part of what goes into making that determination is for the court to evaluate the intent of the policymakers because if the court finds that what they set out to do, what they intended to do was in every instance possible to segregate on the basis of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.414" offset="8957053">The fact that they may have been incompetent and therefore unsuccessful in some instances is not exculpatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.699" offset="8986206">That's a factor to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.375" offset="8992893">The court has to consider whether the racial segregation in a particular school is the result of patterns over which the school officials did not have control and could not be thought reciprocally to have impacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.236" offset="9056319">Housing is one such instance where it can be shown their policies of segregation did not either precede or go lockstep with segregative policies on the part of the other state empowered people such as realtors or licensed people such as brokers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2257.948" offset="9135208">This Court specifically noted that it took into account the Columbus official's system-wide policy with respect to what to do with black children in the pre-1954 era.</text>
