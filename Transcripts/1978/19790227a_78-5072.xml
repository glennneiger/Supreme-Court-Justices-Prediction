            <label>Ms. Sana F. Shtasel</label>
            <text syncTime="22.142" offset="88503">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.925" offset="103654">My name is Sana Shtasel appearing for the petitioner in the case this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.286" offset="129045">The case before you today arises on writ of certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.404" offset="165616">The basic question is whether a cause of action from money damages may be implied under the Fifth Amendment to redress sex discrimination in federal employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.672" offset="218593">If that question is answered in the affirmative, this Court then must determine whether respondent is nonetheless absolutely immune from suit by virtue of the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.229" offset="284839">The facts of this case are simple and stark.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.577" offset="302289">Petitioner was employed by respondent then a United States Congressman for a six-month period in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.154" offset="344607">Despite the fact that petitioner was an able, energetic, and extremely capable secretary as attested to by the respondent in his letter of dismissal, which appears in the appendix in this case at pages 6 and 7, respondent dismissed petitioner solely, explicitly, and expressly because he wanted a man rather than a woman to fill that position.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="112.764" offset="450978">Do you mean as secretary that's the way he described her?</text>

            <text syncTime="118.052" offset="472189">The title of the petition -- of the position Mr. Justice Blackmun was deputy administrative assistant but it is the functions of the job that are in question here and no one has ever contended that the petitioner did anything other than secretarial functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.604" offset="558393">That is exactly how her job was described in the letter terminating her employment which is the only thing we have on the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.949" offset="607713">Petitioner therefore brought suit allegedly --</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="154.949" offset="619729">Do you think it would make a difference if her task were secretarial exclusively or administrative assistant at least impart?</text>

            <label>Ms. Sana F. Shtasel</label>
            <text syncTime="165.290" offset="661107">It might make a difference Mr. Justice when we get to the question of the operation of the Speech or Debate Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.337" offset="693290">It should not make a difference as to whether the petitioner has a cause of action under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.261" offset="720980">Whether however, her job functions would be so integral to the congressmen's legislative functions that the employment relationship should nonetheless be covered with absolute immunity is a question which must be addressed there.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.889" offset="795481">Our position however is that there is no way that the Speech or Debate Clause can apply to the -- to a low level non-policymaking clerical employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.621" offset="854413">I might say that this case arises on a 12 (b) (6) motion to dismiss so that our contentions here for the -- in the procedural posture of this case must be taken to be the ones applicable.</text>

            <text syncTime="319.398" offset="1277492">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.868" offset="1291389">Petitioner, following her termination, brought suit a legend that she had been a victim of sex discrimination in violation of the Fifth Amendment premising jurisdiction upon 28 U.S.C. Section 1331 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="340.604" offset="1362338">The District Court dismissed this case holding that plaintiff had no private cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.960" offset="1391804">A panel of the Fifth Circuit of Appeals reversed on that issue and then proceeded to canvass all the related constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.217" offset="1432764">It held as had the District Court that no immunity doctrine would bar the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.651" offset="1462544">Rehearing en banc was held to assess whether the doctrines of legislative immunity and political question which I might add had been raised for the first time by the panel were applicable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.642" offset="1522521">The en banc court however did not decide that question, rather it decided an issue that had not been briefed before the panel had been conceded by respondent at the panel and had neither been raised by the respondent on rehearing nor briefed by him in that proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.678" offset="1606635">The Court held that an implied cause of action does not arise under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and accordingly that petitioner should have no remedy whatever to vindicate her fundamental constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.102" offset="1692317">The validity of that decision is the first question for this Court's determination today.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.533" offset="1722096">For the reason stated in our briefs to this Court, this case is controlled by Bivens against Six Unknown named agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.094" offset="1768281">In Bivens, this Court held first that the petitioner had a private cause of action for damages arising directly under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.965" offset="1811853">Second, that the federal right was independent from any state right that might be implicated, and third that money damages were remedial mechanism normally available in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.403" offset="1873607">In the seven-and-half years since Bivens was decided, nine courts of appeals and countless district courts have applied Bivens to constitutional amendments other than the Fourth and to federal officials other than narcotics agents.</text>

            <text syncTime="487.704" offset="1950720">Counsel, some of us were in dissent in Bivens and do you think that blocks us in and makes us necessarily unsympathetic to your posture here?</text>

            <text syncTime="500.907" offset="2003592">Mr. Justice Blackmun, I'd be delighted if the dissents Bivens were persuaded by the cause of action should be applied under the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.270" offset="2040999">I think that the rational of the Bivens' majority and the rational of the courts that have applied Bivens in the succeeding years is sufficient to suggest that we can apply a cause of action under Bivens here.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.973" offset="2111843">Indeed as well, there are other factors in this case which make it perhaps a stronger case than Bivens for the implication of a cause of action from money damages under the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="540.382" offset="2161476">You know, we do try to be individually consistent and what I'm asking is, is there any escape for those of us who were in dissent in Bivens?</text>

            <label>Ms. Sana F. Shtasel</label>
            <text syncTime="551.358" offset="2205362">I would suggest one Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.587" offset="2218318">One of the concerns was that Congress had not expressly spoken on the question in the Fourth Amendment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.836" offset="2263249">In this case, Congress has a formatively declared in 5 U.S.C. 7151 that employees of members of Congress are not to be discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.074" offset="2316225">Accordingly to the extent that this Court needs to look or wants to look the congressional declaration in the area is a path.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.033" offset="2352065">As a second possibility, Mr. Justice, there were some concern in by the Bivens' dissenters that the federal courts would be subjected to an avalanche of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.400" offset="2401593">Indeed, there have been almost eight years of federal litigation in this area and known for it other than the en banc for prolong has suggested that there's a problem of judicial and manageability in this area.</text>

          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="615.342" stopTime="628.142">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="615.342" offset="2461362">Yes, but you just made reference to a number of cases in this area whether the courts had gone in your favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.569" offset="2502217">So, there is some litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="628.142" offset="2512562">There's extensive litigation in the area.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="631.973" offset="2527817">Doesn't some of your answer to Mr. Justice Blackmun cut the other way in the sense that although the statute is on the books the general kind of hortatory statute, Congress is quite carefully considered whether it wanted to make its members subject to say Title VI, the way the Executive Branch members are or whether it wanted to subject its members to any particular strictures in their hiring and firing and they simply have not done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.774" offset="2666998">They've considered it and rejected it.</text>

            <label>Ms. Sana F. Shtasel</label>
            <text syncTime="670.581" offset="2682253">Our argument Mr. Chief Justice -- Mr. Justice Rehnquist, pardon me, is that Congress cannot mandate no remedy for violations of constitutional rights and indeed in this case it is never suggested that there should be no juridical remedy for this kind of violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.998" offset="2771905">Indeed, it has not brought congressional employees under the ambit of Title VII and it could certainly enact legislation which would so provide and indeed even protect its own members from the possibility of personal liability which has been done in other context.</text>

            <text syncTime="714.788" offset="2859050">Well, that proposition may be entirely some but it doesn't seem to me that it's really makes your case a stronger one than Bivens as you suggested to Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>

            <text syncTime="725.748" offset="2902936">In Bivens, there was no congressional policy stated in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.247" offset="2924983">In this one, in this case, at most we have a congressional hortatory statute which declares what the policy of the United States is to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.214" offset="2996767">Moving along, I would suggest that the court below does stand alone in the face of this authority and in doing so in refusing to imply a constitutional cause of action the en banc court did erroneously look to the criteria enumerated in Cort against Ash for implication of remedies from federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.896" offset="3095510">The respondent reaches the same result by different root.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.113" offset="3116408">He uses the proviso of Bivens that special factors might counsel hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress and argues that some seven special factors counsel hesitation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.656" offset="3186521">Each of the Court criteria and each of the special factors relied upon by the respondent are dressed in our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2541.730" offset="10166857">I would assume that's correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2551.374" offset="10205414">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.787" offset="10207086">You know but of course the aides and the personal assistance of the legislators have themselves been found to share this immunity and so the employees of the Congressman must be considered in Speech and Debate Clause situation regardless of what the original make-up and function in Congress was at that time anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.243" offset="10292872">But again the basic question that legislator asked when he hires one of these individuals is, how can this person help perform my legislative function?</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.442" offset="10333727">And therefore, we submit that the personal staffs of Congressmen are assembled, they are brought together in a very broad legislative context which context should be immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.084" offset="10388271">It should be immune exclusive by the Court, it's not immune from scrutiny by the House's themselves and it's not immune from the voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.645" offset="10426514">I want to examine with you the effects of not conferring speech and debate immunity in this case and the effects of not considering the separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.321" offset="10465280">We will have time consuming by burdens of lawsuits that will be inflicted on Congressmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.971" offset="10487850">They will be involved in extensive discovery procedures that case alone is four-and-half years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.404" offset="10509584">We feel that if Congressmen are made to answer before the judiciary, before the -- for the personnel decisions that is going to have a chilling effect on their personal decisions, that Congressmen will be forced to retain in competent aides when they would wish they can get rid of them but they're scared to for fear of lawsuits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2650.527" offset="10602057">That's true, Your Honor but we feel that their interests really are concern more on the fair employment practices aspects of the society problems today than they are on the true separation of powers problem which I think accord this, if you understand me on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.710" offset="10682828">If this cause of action is permitted and Speech and Debate Clause immunity doesn't apply we're going to have lawsuits of Congressmen for fees of a higher, the discharge of employees the failure to promote, failure to grant wage increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.070" offset="10740193">There may be hundreds of applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.547" offset="10746149">We're not talking about a few discharges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.643" offset="10754508">They were talking about hundreds of applicants who desire to work on the staffs of Congressman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.199" offset="10776764">The employment decisions that will be potentially judiciable and which -- which cause of action would be created would be an immense number because this had might the Pentagon Papers episode or the criminal situation the (Inaudible) the everyday employment decisions that occur in Congress, and for this reason we feel that there would be a very improper injection of this Court into the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.698" offset="10886792">It would mean that members of Congress would have to get familiar with statistical experts, industrial psychologists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.682" offset="10910720">They'll have to worry about class actions every Congressman is going to need personnel expert and labor lawyer to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.932" offset="10935693">We feel that this would impair the integrity of the legislative process and would be both unwarranted invasion of the principle separation of powers and they restrict the view of the Speech and Debate immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.609" offset="10990341">That's all I have Your Honor unless there are questions.</text>
