            <text syncTime="125.495" offset="605393">The question in this case is whether when the government condemns facilities that are operated on a not-for-profit basis by a church or another private entity, the measure of just compensation that the Fifth Amendment requires is the fair market value of facilities taken or whether, on the other hand, it is the cost of constructing substitute facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.502" offset="717406">The respondent, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Synod of the Lutheran Church in America, owned three separate parcels of land, totaling about 300 acres on the Delaware River in northeastern Pennsylvania which had used those three summer camps for the young people.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen R. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="174.683" offset="802147">The 564 acres, Mr. Justice Blackmun, included a number of tracks besides the three owned by the Synod.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.619" offset="833808">At the beginning of the appendix, you'll find the declarations of taking applicable to all the tracks, and the Synod tracks are three of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.091" offset="879783">In June of 1970, the United States condemned these three parcels for a river project.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.517" offset="909458">Six years before, in 1964, anticipating that the land would be condemned, respondent had purchased some 3,800 acres of land in the nearby Pocono as a replacement site for its camps.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.659" offset="974033">When the land on the river was taken, the Government offered to pay $485,000.00 as the fair market value of the camps taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.415" offset="1009037">Respondent, however, rejected the offer, claiming that the cost of developing equivalent camps at the new site would be something in excess of $5 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.829" offset="1054699">Respondent accordingly asked the Court to rule that the appropriate standard was the cost of constructing the new facilities, not the fair market value of the old facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.318" offset="1104645">The District Court ruled against that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.713" offset="1114258">The respondent took an interlocutory appeal and the Fourth Circuit ruled that the substitute facility's measure of compensation is available to private owners of non-profit community facilities in certain cases, as well as to public owners, that is governmental entities, as it had previously recognized -- been recognized to be available.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="276.514" offset="1209448">Am I right, gener -- I'm thinking that this Court has even applied that doctrine to public.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_r_barnett" startTime="282.593" stopTime="659.371">
            <label>Mr. Stephen R. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="282.593" offset="1233795">That is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.258" offset="1236407">This Court has never endorsed the Substitute Facilities Doctrine even for public entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.412" offset="1265037">The Brown case, which is cited in the briefs, was a case in which Congress, after one town was flooded by a public project, Congress appropriated money to condemn another area as a substitute site and the question was the constitutional validity of that subsequent taking, whether that was a public use under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.054" offset="1367542">The Court held that it was and the Court's language talked about how it's a reasonable thing to substitute a new town for the old town, but the question was not the scope of compensation for a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.191" offset="1412159">So, this Court has never approved the Substitute Facilities Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.782" offset="1430549">In any event, the Third Circuit here, in its first opinion, said that the doctrine can be applicable to a private non-profit entity in certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.335" offset="1472763">It described the key circumstance as one in which the facilities taken are reasonably necessary to public welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.015" offset="1511424">On remand, the trial was divided into two phases.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.391" offset="1524903">The issue in the first phase was whether the substitute facility's measure of compensation applied to the taking of these camps.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.304" offset="1556564">After a 10-day trial, the jury returned a verdict, by special interrogatory, finding that the doctrine did not apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.831" offset="1594702">The second phase of the trial was devoted to the issue of the fair market value of the condemned camps.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.748" offset="1626363">Respondent sought to establish the fair market value by what is called the cost approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.740" offset="1650291">That is, the reproduction cost of the camps minus depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.038" offset="1671502">That is, the reproduction cost of the buildings minus the depreciation of the buildings plus the value of the underlying land.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.532" offset="1701491">The Government used two evidentiary approaches to show the fair market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.783" offset="1722493">One was, again, the cost approach and the other was the so-called market data approach, that is, comparable sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.676" offset="1754049">The jury returned a verdict -- an award of $740,000.00 as the fair market value of the camps which was a compromise between the positions taken by the opposing sides, which, of course often happens in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.627" offset="1821863">Respondent then took a second appeal, and the Court of Appeals reversed again.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.914" offset="1839000">In addition to finding error in comments to the jury in closing, the Court held that the District Court's instructions on application of the substitute facility's measure of compensation have been erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.302" offset="1896573">As the Court of Appeals restated the doctrine, it has three requirements, the property must be operated on a not-for-profit basis, there must be no ready market for the particular type of property, and the facilities must be reasonably necessary to the public welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.379" offset="1964910">That is, I should have made clear, that is the Court of Appeals restatement of what it held the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.591" offset="1985703">The Court of Appeals then went on to elucidate further what it meant and, with respect to the no-ready-market test, for example, the Court held that even if respondent could have sold its camps and even if they had a fair market value, as the jury had found that they did, this condition of the substitute facilities test was met if respondent could not have replaced the camps in the market place for a cost roughly equal to their fair market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.447" offset="2117151">With respect to the third condition that the facility be reasonably necessary to the public welfare, the majority explained that what it meant by this was not really necessity, but simply that the condemned facility must “provide a benefit to the community that will not be as fully provided after the facility is taken.”</text>
            <text syncTime="525.280" offset="2204505">Thus, the Court gave as an example, if the camps here did, as respondent contended, help to reduce juvenile crime by taking some youngsters from Inner City Philadelphia and, thus, helping to alleviate the gang problem in Inner City Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.750" offset="2278379">Then, the Court said these camps will provide to the entire community of eastern Pennsylvania, not just to the campers.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.045" offset="2315577">Judge Stern concurred in the opinion under compulsion of the Court's earlier opinion, but his opinion is essentially a dissent on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.676" offset="2354030">Judge Rosen dissented but, from the Court's interpretation of the earlier opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.025" offset="2379421">The Court of Appeals remanded the case for a new trial pursuant to its newly articulated standards and, at that point, this Court intervened by granting certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.536" offset="2425501">Well, the Substitute Facilities Doctrine with which we deal here and which, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist has pointed out, this Court has never approved is, in any event, an exception to what this Court has made clear is the standard method of computing just compensation under the Fifth Amendment and that method, of course, if fair market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.855" offset="2514840">The Court has defined just compensation as the full monetary equivalent of the property taken in the Reynolds case and, as stated in Almota, the Court earlier established the concept of market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.619" offset="2565831">The owner is entitled to the fair market value of his property at the time of taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.592" offset="2589759">Now, the Court has also made clear that where the property is so special that market data, such as comparable sales, may be few, resort must be had to other data to ascertain its value, this is the Miller case.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.652" offset="2661961">And, those other approaches are, for one, the income approach, capitalization of net income, which can be used for business properties, or the cost approach, reproduction cost minus depreciation, which in fact was used here in the fair market value aspect of the trial.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="659.371" offset="2740851">It isn't very helpful to use a capitalization approach on a voice camp which --</text>

          <turn speaker="stephen_r_barnett" startTime="663.749" stopTime="918.915">
            <label>Mr. Stephen R. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="663.749" offset="2758405">No, it will not be, and nobody -- (Voice Overlap) -- and nobody suggested that that approach be used here, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.732" offset="2782333">But, the Court has indicated that these approaches “may have relevance but only, of course, as bearing on what a prospective purchaser would have paid.”</text>
            <text syncTime="679.890" offset="2822980">They are all approaches that are designed to determine fair market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.157" offset="2847953">Now, the difference with the Substituted Facilities Doctrine is that it concedingly is not a method of determining value at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.111" offset="2887868">It is -- or at least certainly not fair market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.337" offset="2900720">It is a completely different avenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.000" offset="2911378">As the respondents here -- as respondent here says in its brief at page 23, the doctrine is not used in conjunction with the market value approach evaluation but as an alternative to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.945" offset="2959130">And, thus, the difference which is indicated by the facts of this case where the fair market value was found to be $740,000.00 and yet, respondent claims that the cost of substitute facilities would be $4 million or $5 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.513" offset="3021406">Now, respondent has attempted to justify the use of the Substitute Facilities Doctrine here on the basis that this case is unique or at least very, very special, that it is a situation that arises infrequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.109" offset="3099773">What is rare about it?</text>
            <text syncTime="750.581" offset="3105729">Well, respondent says that this is a case in which the property's chief value is in its use, not its status in the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.311" offset="3140629">And this theme that the true value of this property is in its use and that that makes this case very rare and different recurs throughout respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.966" offset="3187231">In the first place, we're not sure what this means, that the true value is in its use.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.203" offset="3208234">It may means simply that the property is adopted for a particular use, in this case, camps, and that makes it particularly valuable.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.844" offset="3250761">If that is all it means, we have no quarrel with it whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.088" offset="3263718">It is what this Court has said, for example, in the Mitchell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.432" offset="3281063">Well, if it means more than that, we see nothing so rare about this case and no justification here for deviating from the principles of fair market value that this Court has laid down.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.237" offset="3332368">If it simply means that there is a disparity here, as respondent emphasizes, between what the property owned would be seen by way of fair market value and what the property owner needs in order to preserve the use to which the property was devoted, well, that happens very commonly.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.465" offset="3409272">It often happens that a property may be -- may suffice for its owner's use, even be uniquely well adapted for that use and yet, when it's condemned, the fair market value fall short of what the owner would have to pay to acquire a property equally suitable for carrying on that use.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.754" offset="3490356">It may happen, for example, in the case of an old factory specially adapted for the owner's use.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.221" offset="3516270">For example, in the Certain Property in Manhattan case, 306 F.2d 439, one of the issues involved the printing plant of a newspaper, Il Progreso, in Manhattan which was an old printing plant but very well adapted to putting out this particular newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.446" offset="3593174">However, the evidence was that if anybody bought the property, they would tear the building down and use it for something else, that is, it -- the fair market value of the structure as a printing plant was nil, and the Court held that there would be no compensation for that structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.811" offset="3666631">And, that is one example.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.414" offset="3673004">Another example would be an old and man-shackled house, very commodious, very convenient for the family living in it, but if the house were condemned, its age -- and I suppose we're not talking about a house in Washington, D.C. but elsewhere, its age might bring it a reduced price on the market which would not suffice to buy a new house or any house of equal size and convenience.</text>

            <text syncTime="918.915" offset="3779062">I suppose, Mr. Barnett, you take the same position with regard to an old church, too.</text>

            <text syncTime="927.731" offset="3814275">The -- similar with an old church, the fair market value might be insufficient to purchase a new church equally suitable to the needs of the congregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.880" offset="3866937">On the other hand, it might not be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.973" offset="3879267">The reproduction cost of the old church, if it's not a worn out old church, but a well-preserved old church, the reproduction cost conceivably could be higher than the cost of building a new plastic church.</text>

            <text syncTime="958.403" offset="3936946">Well, that was the case too in Cors, wasn't it, where the ships condemned had risen in value and it's perfectly clear that the Court said the award -- the just compensation award need not be sufficient to enable the owner to buy ships at an inflated value because the inflated value had been created by the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1054.594" offset="4321782">But, it's -- it's noteworthy that the Substitute Facilities Doctrine, as applied to public entities, more often than not has been applied without a deduction for depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.567" offset="4369638">And the trial court here so-ruled, at page 650 of the transcript, the Court, after stating the Synod argues that depreciation cannot be concerted in a substitute facilities evaluation, that's page 657, the Court went on to rule at page 650, “I think that the depreciation is not a proper deduction for taking a public property and, therefore, it should not be permitted when it is private.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.674" offset="4470053">And, indeed, if the purpose of the Substitute Facilities Doctrine is to allow substitution, replacement of the facility, it is certainly arguable that that purpose is frustrating.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="1101.651" offset="4509968">Well, your ultimate purpose is to provide just compensation as required by the Constitution and it -- and one could say that that means you've got to have full compensation and able to replace it, but you're not entitled to a profit on the transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1113.025" offset="4555421">Well, one certainly could say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.752" offset="4562422">We would say that you are entitled only to the fair market value of what you have and you are not entitled to replacement at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.389" offset="4592933">One reason for that is the tremendous -- and a point that we -- that has not really been emphasized so far in this case is the tremendous flexibility and leeway that comes in by way of the Substitute Facilities Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.881" offset="4654895">It is suppose to be a functional equivalent substitute facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.141" offset="4675897">And this case well illustrate how much flexibility can come in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.739" offset="4698363">For example, here, respondent had 300 acres of flat land along the river where its camps were located.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.577" offset="4729710">It went out and bought 3,800 acres of wooded hilly land on which the only water was a creek.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.399" offset="4760952">Thus, in order to functionally equivalent aquatic facilities, it is necessary to dam the creek to create a small lake for which respondent would have $1 million to build the dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.986" offset="4811316">Respondent wants three beaches to put in on the small lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.702" offset="4830229">Respondent has to build a bridge to get over the new lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.416" offset="4845066">The old camps were on a public road.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.723" offset="4854262">Respondent has to build a new access road of 1.6 miles to get to the new camp plus substantial interior road facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.593" offset="4889788">The trial court charged that this was all alright, that so long as the jury found that the new camp was adequate, that the new site was adequate to respondent's needs, the cost resulting from new conditions at the site should be taken into account in computing the cost of substitute facilities, and that is the one of the huge reasons for the difference between reproduction cost of the old facilities and the cost of substitute facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.535" offset="5033462">Well, respondent argues that the doctrine should be extended to private facilities and asks to put a hard case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.360" offset="5084766">Why should it be that when a city takes -- or when the United States Government takes a city school, a public school, the city is compensated with the cost of constructing a new school, but if the city were to take a parochial school right across the street, the non-profit church that owns the parochial school would not be entitled to such compensation but only to the fair market value?</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.743" offset="5198346">Well, we think there are a number of explanations, even assuming that the doctrine should be applied to the public facility in the first place or even assuming that it should be applied in particular to public facilities like schools for which fair market values can be established as distinguished from where the doctrine started, streets and highways which had no fair market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.661" offset="5298030">For one thing, the public entity is often under -- the assumption in the case of the public entity for the doctrine being applied is that it is under a requirement to replace the facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.809" offset="5354559">Now, this requirement can be legally enforced in various ways in the case of the public entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.887" offset="5382875">Now, it is true that a private entity, such as the church, may say that it too is required to replace its school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.027" offset="5411506">It needs its school for its purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.666" offset="5422059">It has children who are attending the condemned school, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.080" offset="5439718">One answer is that in the -- one difference is that in the case of the public entity the requirement is legally enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.128" offset="5475871">A further answer is that if simply need to replace is the test, why stop with private non-profit entities?</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.454" offset="5517145">A business firm which has its only establishment taken, its only manufacturing establishment, its only sales establishment is surely under as much factory need to replace it as a non-profit entity would be or as a government would be and, yet, no one has suggested that all this Court's prior ruling should be thrown out and substitute facilities be substituted across the board for the fair market value test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.341" offset="5636786">A third difference is that if the facility is not in fact constructed with the substitute facilities award or if it is constructed and subsequently sold or devoted to another purpose, in the case of the public facility area, the assurance is that only the public will benefit from the money in any event, whereas, in the case of the non-profit private facility, one cannot have that assurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.190" offset="5764159">A further difference is the need for a very difficult task of devising standards that arises once one goes beyond public facilities, and that difficulty is well illustrated by this case where the Court of Appeals first said the standard was whether the non-profit facility was reasonably necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.252" offset="5856423">Then, as to the jury's negative verdict, the Court relaxed its standard and said the test is whether the facility provides the community benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.915" offset="5891009">And, when we pointed out some of the difficulties in determining what's the community and what's the benefit, respondent now does not defend the Court of Appeals latest opinion either and respondent simply contends that all non-profit entities are entitled so long as their facility is devoted to any religious public charitable or educational purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.007" offset="5983378">The problem with that is it would cost a lot of money, for one thing, and we find it hard to find in the constitution anything that says all non-profit entities are entitled by constitutional command to the substitute facility's measure of compensation, whereas, profit entities are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.909" offset="6063000">In addition to -- so, those are the reasons why we think that if the doctrine is to be recognized at all, that it's a very good reason for limiting it to public governmental entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.259" offset="6104377">Finally, there are in this case the First Amendment problems that we have -- had noted where a church is concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="2030.461" offset="8225207">The second is that the camp was fully used before the taking and, third, that the taking itself did not eliminate the use for the camp.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.178" offset="8268048">There would be no qualitative evaluation of the benefit of the camp or, for that matter, of a bath house or school or a playground or park.</text>

            <text syncTime="3322.268" offset="13392436">The -- the Government tries to make a distinction by saying the governmental unit is under some kind of a legal necessity and we are not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3333.129" offset="13435904">Firstly, the legal necessity has been ruled out at least in the Second and Eighth Circuits, and a different test applied which makes it discretionary with the governmental unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.450" offset="13497135">But, secondly, in this case, it can be guaranteed that we'll use the -- if there's any doubt about it, that we will use the award for the creation of a substitute facility and it can be done so under Section 285 of the condemnation -- the federal condemnation statute by making the award in trust for release as the facility is built.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.459" offset="13589191">This -- this treatment is available, in our opinion, under the general language of Section 285 (a) in the Yale Law Journal note cited in our brief, I think so, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.768" offset="13634435">Now, one final point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.836" offset="13662751">The Government charges that to apply the substitute facilities rule to us is to give us a windfall, and I think this might be in, Your Honor, Mr. Justice Marshall's mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.796" offset="13710608">The Government says that we will get new buildings for what may have been dilapidated buildings with no adjustment for depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.746" offset="13738402">Now, this assertion is without foundation, first, on a factual basis because the fact is and the evidence shows it that our structures were not dilapidated but were well-maintained.</text>

            <text syncTime="3440.534" offset="13865462">That's a technical term and one that I think has been used too loosely in some of the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.774" offset="13894510">We do not concede that depreciation should be deducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.804" offset="13906631">Depreciation is arbit -- is an arbitrary commercial accounting technique, whereby cost is recovered under current profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.657" offset="13949994">In substitute facilities cases, there is a projection of the cost of the equivalent with a discount in the language that was used by the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.323" offset="14008613">These are the Second Circuit's words, “a discount by reason of the benefit which accrues to the condemnee when a new building replaces one with expired useful years.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.772" offset="14054484">Now, the Second Circuit was very careful not to refer to depreciation but, instead, did carefully refer to a discount by reason of the benefit which accrues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.949" offset="14111117">And the Second Circuit also reassured the government with these further words, “Even when substitution is required, sumptuous awards need not be feared.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.627" offset="14161899">Exact duplication is not essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.877" offset="14174856">The substitute need only be functionally equivalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.571" offset="14189693">The equivalence is one of utility.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.291" offset="14228564">The -- my friend raises a further point, which I think is purely spectral, that we may take the award and apply it for totally unrelated uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.481" offset="14277256">The same could be said for the award to a city for bath houses and recreation centers but, again, the condemnation statute will protect this situation perfectly be the condemnee, a municipal corporation or a non-profit corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.571" offset="14337651">As to the future, the specter has projected and the Government says we may rebuild the camp and later discontinue its use as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.077" offset="14367640">Again, we say that the same comment applies equally to the governmental condemnee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.555" offset="14389582">Short of a sale of the camp, it is hard to see how the use of such a single-purpose facility could be greatly altered and if it is sold for other purposes, the price realized will contain its own penalty, in that, the proceeds will in all likelihood be as deficient as is the market value award already entered in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.630" offset="14509850">In closing, may it pleas the Court, the question in human terms in this case is whether the non-profit condemnees camp can, with constitutional impunity, be expropriated and its full use, purpose, and function forever destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.313" offset="14580590">That's the result the government seeks sanction for here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3626.611" offset="14609847">Well, just a couple of points, Mr. Chief Justice, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.989" offset="14627297">My brother's key argument for the applicability of the Substitute Facilities Doctrine here to an entity like the Synod for this camps is that, as he says, public benefits are presumed from the fact that the facility has run on a non-profit basis and devoted to a charitable, educational, or religious purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.996" offset="14727398">Now, I'm not clear from his position whether the reliance is on the public benefit that these camps are said to provide or whether it is simply on the fact that this is a religious institution and anything done by this religious institution would qualify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.724" offset="14790301">Some of his language would cut either way, but if it's the public benefit, then we see these problems under the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3694.063" offset="14879640">Yes, to that extent, it is similar to the benefit to the community test of the Court of Appeals and we see those problems with that under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.110" offset="14915793">It has the Court involved in determining whether what a religious entity does provides a community benefit or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.677" offset="14946095">In the Walz case, 397 U.S. at 664, this Court said something very apropos to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.352" offset="14972740">“We find it unnecessary to justify the tax exemption on the social welfare services or good works that some churches perform for parishioners or others to give emphasis to so variable in aspect to the work of religious bodies will introduce an element of governmental evaluation and standards as to the worth of particular social welfare programs."</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.056" offset="15055600">If, on the other hand, my brother's position is, and that's what the language in their reply brief would imply, that any religious purpose qualifies, then, they are saying that simply because of the church doing something religious, it qualifies and it wouldn't matter then whether these camps were converted into purely religious facilities or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.901" offset="15135013">Now, on that basis, we have the constitutional problem that the award here on a substitute facilities basis of much more than the fair market of the camps --</text>
