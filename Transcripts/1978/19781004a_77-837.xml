            <text syncTime="16.793" offset="170506">At the close of Court yesterday I was discussing the fact that the private conduct which is authorized by the California statute could in no sense be considered a violation of the antitrust laws because it does not involve conduct, which has been declared illegal under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.758" offset="242395">Far from it, the conduct is protected by the Noerr-Pennington political action exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.474" offset="265279">I also would stress that the act itself, even if it did authorize conduct which was not political action, and which could conceivably be held to violate the antitrust laws but for the statute itself would still constitute state action under the test.</text>

            <text syncTime="77.166" offset="412087">I assume that is the case, but I did not research that particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.473" offset="437269">This quickly because the point is made I think in appellant's replied briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.977" offset="459316">Under the standards that this Court has come down with in the five or six cases really in the last four or five years, the conduct here of making a protest to the board would be clearly authorized by a state statute exhibiting a clear intent to remove this operation of this particular industry from competition and therefore, from the application of the Sherman Act and there is a clear intent in the statute to substitute state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.338" offset="580733">As established I think in the briefs distinguishes it from (Inaudible) of Cantor, Lafayette Power and the Schwegmann case of 1951.</text>

            <text syncTime="147.527" offset="693478">I think that as far as the preemption issue is concerned here, appellee's argument has an Alice in Wonderland quality to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="194.333" offset="880724">The state also controls the time during which the temporary order will be in effect because the board can hold a hearing quickly or it can wait the full 60 days.</text>

            <text syncTime="304.740" offset="1322297">Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.987" offset="1339329">The basic issue here is whether under the Fourteenth Amendment a state may grant private individuals the unrestrained use of state power to exclude selectively other private individuals from enjoying the common occupations of life for substantial periods of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.831" offset="1434728">Such a grant of state power to private individuals ought to be particularly suspect since once exercise whether individually or collectively it results in a horizontally imposed restraint on trade long held per se legal under the Sherman Antitrust Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.941" offset="1527097">Now, let me make crystal clear that appellants do not challenge the power of the state to regulate business activities within its boarders through active state supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.230" offset="1572342">What it does challenge is the ability of an existing franchise dealer to use state power selectively, arbitrarily, and capriciously to prevent other equally competent and qualified franchise dealers from enjoying their franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.252" offset="1648410">The existing franchise dealers can do this because the state issues even though the statute is a for core statute, a temporary injunction in favor of the existing dealer without any notice, any hearing or even the slightest consideration by any state official.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.710" offset="1730226">Such a total avocation of state power to private individuals lies at the heart of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.965" offset="1755199">It's not only unreasonable, I really submit it's outrageous.</text>

            <text syncTime="473.635" offset="1997928">I think you had a completely different question there, but what we claim here is the particular wrong is the state advocated its power and instead says,We'll do nothing, but if any private competitor, the one person that has an interest adverse to the interest of the other person objects, you then have this injunction issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.962" offset="2095208">In other words, I'd like to say here, this ought to be clear, under this statute, once General Motors entered into the franchise agreement with Miller and Fox and each of them already had a state license, at that point, under this statute the state was powerless to do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.602" offset="2185801">In the first place, if the franchise was set more than ten miles, not in the 314 mile area, no one could do anything, if it were within the area as you pointed out Justice Stevens, and no one objects it, my clients had an absolute right to open and it's only because there's somebody in that area which I think everyone here has to agree has to be the one person that I cannot depend upon to give me a fair, unbiased determination as to whether there is a violation of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1745.277" offset="7084492">That has been changed and it was changed because of in part the decision of the Third Circuit in the Holiday Inn case and GM felt that perhaps it might be a problem if you would permit some of the existing dealers to object to a new dealer coming in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.203" offset="7160142">And so therefore, with respect to this type of decision, there is not an empire plan, but that is the reason why it seems that this statute has to be bad because if you say that GM with its dealers cannot make this type of arrangement, then clearly, a competing dealer merely by saying, I protest ought not for a period from 90 days to a year-and-a-half be able to impose what is basically a horizontal trade restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.483" offset="7333282">As I understand the law, the Sherman Act says that any statute, state statute which permits a private competitor to do this is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.777" offset="7382497">That's what I think your decision in Schwegmann says, in Schwegmann, the liquid distributor had a valid contract for retail price maintenance with some local retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.624" offset="7429831">The Louisiana statute, however, attempted to arm the private competitor with the ability to extend this contract by making such price fixing enforceable against non-signing retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.725" offset="7482284">Because this extension conflicted with basic antitrust principle, the Louisiana statute was preempted by the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.490" offset="7513318">In Schwegmann, this Court never inquired into whether any private individual had violated the antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.469" offset="7541217">For all higher value imposed restrictions to restrain trade are patently pernicious and are per se violations of the Federal Antitrust Law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2111.101" offset="8547767">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.643" offset="8573994">Mr. Coleman suggest that the Schwegmann decision relieves the appellees of the necessity of demonstrating at least some conduct violative of the federal antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.068" offset="8619656">I would ask the Court to refer to page 386 of that decision reported in 341 U.S in which Justice Douglas unequivocally stated that the scheme their question would be illegal, would be enjoined and would draw civil and criminal penalties and that no court would enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.608" offset="8701785">And that was the Louisiana statute which was struck down by this Court in Schwegmann.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.889" offset="8722892">So it is our submission that Schwegmann cannot relieve the appellees of stating an antitrust claim without showing the predicate facts necessary to make out a violation of some federal antitrust statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.291" offset="8796557">With the Court's permission, Mr. Coleman has pointed out or has characterized a right existing in appellees which depends in large part upon the view that the license granted to a dealer provides him with some unassailable right to locate wherever he wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.296" offset="8876596">In effect, Mr. Coleman posits a portable property interest in the dealer which you could not be deprived of without a due process hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.188" offset="8920168">Well, his characterization is mistaken because a fixed geographical location is integral to the initial issuance and the continued entitlement to a dealer license under California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.013" offset="8971473">In Section 11712 of the California Vehicle Code, the Department of Motor Vehicles, the licensing authority is prohibited from issuing a dealer license to an applicant without an established place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.997" offset="9023404">Section 11721 requires the automatic cancellation of a dealer license whenever a dealer abandons an established place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.080" offset="9059662">Section 11713 makes it a violation of the code not to maintain an established place of business and Section 40000.11 makes that violation a misdemeanor under California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.799" offset="9118595">Your Honors, I see that my time has expired and I thank the Court for its attention.</text>
