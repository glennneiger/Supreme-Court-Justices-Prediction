            <label>Mr. John Vanderstar</label>
            <text syncTime="18.980" offset="179284">Thank you Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.860" offset="182836">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.086" offset="195688">In the fall of 1974, the Department of Housing and Urban Development evicted nearly 200 families from their homes in two federally subsidized housing projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.114" offset="243858">One located in Indianapolis and one in Anacostia section of Washington, D.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.967" offset="271235">HUD had acquired those projects after the project sponsors defaulted on their mortgages which HUD had insured.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.779" offset="302477">Both projects were in need of rehabilitation and the Anacostia project called Sky Tower was halfway through the rehabilitation process.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.688" offset="342079">HUD analyzed the cost of completing the rehabilitation or performing the rehabilitation, analyzed the expected revenues from the projects and a number of other factors and each case made the decision to evict the tenants and then sell the vacant property to private developers.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.250" offset="424417">Some of the Sky Tower tenants, the Anacostia tenants received moving allowances of $300.00 each, some did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.629" offset="465899">But -- and none of the Indianapolis tenants receive moving allowances.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.410" offset="485021">Moreover, HUD did not satisfy itself before evicting these people that there was some place else they could live.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.161" offset="516054">Some place they could afford.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.394" offset="528906">The effect on these people was devastating especially on the larger families, the elderly and the poor which is what most of these people are.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.310" offset="576658">In the Cole record, there is some illustrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.041" offset="587525">Mrs. Irma Francis, her rent went from $77.00 a month to a $165.00 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.907" offset="618977">She's employed and earned $400.00 a month and supports three children.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.288" offset="640502">Mrs. Sadie Cole, her rent went from $84.00 a month to a $156.00 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.753" offset="666415">She received $228.00 a month in public assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.494" offset="685328">She has two children.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.408" offset="692955">Mrs. Jean Fisher, her rent went from $84.00 a month to $189.00 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.537" offset="721481">Her monthly income is $243.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.892" offset="734960">She also has two children.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.077" offset="743633">Judge Gesell found that the impact of this move on the larger families in the Anacostia project was especially serious because of the shortage of housing, low-cost housing especially for large families in this city.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.239" offset="808312">As he pointed out the waiting list of public housing projects in Washington, most of them in the four-bedroom and larger category exceeds 4,000 families.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.267" offset="856482">Now, it's difficult for most of us in this room to imagine trying to live under those conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.123" offset="887829">But Congress knew about those conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.204" offset="900159">It informed itself, it studied this problem over course of many years and it enacted statute, the Relocation Act, and in that Act it said we don't want this to happen again that whenever there's a federal dollar being used for a federal project, we don't want to displace people from their homes unless, unless the agency is satisfied that these people have some place else to live, some place they can afford.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.265" offset="1032443">Both sides in this case agree that the critical statutory language in the Relocation Act is the definition and in particular the so-called written order clause in the definition of displaced person.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.545" offset="1093569">A displaced person is someone who “moves from real property” either as a result of the acquisition of such real property that's the acquisition clause or is the result of the written order of the acquiring agency to vacate real property, that's the written order clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.865" offset="1178833">And in either case, it has to be for a program or project undertaken by a federal agency.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="275.084" offset="1203702">And you're here under the written order clause?</text>

            <label>Mr. John Vanderstar</label>
            <text syncTime="276.880" offset="1210911">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.751" offset="1214360">If I had to put my case in a nutshell, I would say that the language of the written order clause covers the tenants in these two cases and that, that result, is perfectly consistent with the congressional purpose in enacting the Relocation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.499" offset="1285413">The acquisition clause was relied on below but it's not relied on here.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="299.356" offset="1300773">Would you say that this is not the core of the purpose that Congress had in mind?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_vanderstar" startTime="304.443" stopTime="580.812">
            <label>Mr. John Vanderstar</label>
            <text syncTime="304.443" offset="1321148">By this displacement, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.049" offset="1335568">Certainly, the whole focus of Congress' study going back to 1961, nine years before the Act became effective was on displacement caused by federal programs or federally assisted program which are not pertinent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.638" offset="1405889">The written order clause I think plainly covers these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.379" offset="1420936">They move as a result of a written order of the acquiring agency namely HUD, the agency that had acquired these properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.635" offset="1457925">And the orders were issued pursuant to a federal program or project.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.361" offset="1476838">What was that program or project?</text>
            <text syncTime="345.629" offset="1485928">It's spelled out in about 150 pages of material in the HUD handbook called “The Property Disposition Handbook” which describes the property disposition program that is to be employed by HUD when it acquires properties through mortgage default.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.380" offset="1568893">It's perfectly clear we submit that there was a program or project that led to the displacement of these tenants.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.926" offset="1607032">It's perfectly clear that a written order of the acquiring agency caused their displacement so that written order clause applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.915" offset="1647052">Now let's see if that makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.970" offset="1659277">Let's look at the statute overall and see if that makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.764" offset="1678399">It seems to me that the best place, if it please the Court, to look for the overall intent of Congress is in the section entitled “Declaration of Policy” which is Section 201 of the Act and it says this,“The purpose of this sub-chapter and that's the relocation title of these complex statute is to establish a uniform policy for the fair and equitable treatment of persons displaced as a result of federal and federally assisted programs, in order that” and I'm still quoting “in order that such persons shall not suffer disproportionate injuries as a result of programs designed for the benefit of the public as a whole,” so the emphasis is perfectly plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.112" offset="1891871">So, the emphasis is on persons displaced as a result of federal and federally assisted programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.325" offset="1936697">These tenants were displaced as a result of a federal program.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.864" offset="1962820">There's another place we can look in the statute for evidence of congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.592" offset="1985703">It's more statutory language and that is in Section 206 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="476.715" offset="2010258">I might point out that this statute covers not only tenants and not only homeowners but it also covers businesses and farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.618" offset="2041814">But in Section 206 (b), Congress made it quite clear that where people were being displaced from their homes, Congress had a special concern as you would imagine.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.003" offset="2095417">And in Section 206 (b), Congress used these unequivocal words</text>
            <text syncTime="504.085" offset="2119764">“No person shall be required to move from his dwelling on or after January 2, 1971 on account of any federal project unless the federal agency head is satisfied that replacement housing in accordance with Section 205 (c) (3) is available to such person.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.625" offset="2225821">Now 205 (c) (3) refers to replacement housing that meets a great number of characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.100" offset="2271796">And the most important one, I submit is this one, at rents or prices within the financial means of the families and individuals displaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.063" offset="2319653">There are others as well but it seems to me clear that in 201 the declaration of policy covering the statute as a whole and in 206 (b), that portion of the statute which announces Congress' policy with respect to displacement of people from their homes from their dwellings that these people were intended to be covered by the Relocation Act.”</text>

            <text syncTime="580.812" offset="2426650">Is it your contention that the word "person" in 206 (b) is more broadly defined than the term “displaced person” in the definitional section?</text>

            <text syncTime="659.182" offset="2740120">But certainly the written order clause is the one we rely on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.475" offset="2761226">Now, it's been suggested by the Government in their briefs that this statute should not be read in the way I have outlined that the written order clause should not applied to cover the tenants in these two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.705" offset="2822144">Why is that?</text>
            <text syncTime="681.100" offset="2827786">Well, the Government's principal argument, if I can take the liberty of putting words in their mouth, is that the program or project that leads to the eviction has to be the same program or project that lead to the acquisition so that if you have an acquisition for one program or project and then you have a displacement for another program or project, the Government contends those displaced tenants are not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.477" offset="2957249">I find it hard to see where that interpretation comes from.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.556" offset="2981595">There's certainly nothing in the legislative history and there's certainly nothing in the language of the statute that supports that interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.065" offset="3019630">Indeed, I think it quite clear as I've indicated that Congress was focusing on displacement.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.344" offset="3052753">This is not an internal revenue code.</text>

            <text syncTime="1328.917" offset="5419029">In our view, the Uniform Relocation Act applies when the Government acquires property for a public purpose and people are displaced as a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.635" offset="5465945">It does not apply when the Government already owns property and it orders tenants to move in order they can put some other use, make some other use of that property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.304" offset="5516622">In other words, we see this Act as in Mr. Vanderstar's words, an eminent domain statute primarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.455" offset="5553194">In other words, if this statute applies to cases in which the Government is acting in its capacity as taker of property, whether that be by purchase or by condemnation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1392.163" offset="5671999">It does not have to be a fee, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.594" offset="5681716">But in any event, it would be acquiring the property or at least the acquiring an interest in the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.438" offset="5701151">The -- the plaintiffs view this case more broadly as they've said as including cases in which the Government is acting basically in its capacity as landlord.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.159" offset="5756008">Now, to underscore the difference between the positions that the parties have taken in this case, let's take an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.089" offset="5787773">Suppose, HUD had acquired this property, 20 or 30 years ago, in that case the plaintiffs would say that if these people have been living and others have been living on the property ever since that time and HUD decided at some point that they needed to make some other use of the property, perhaps, the property was deteriorating or something as was the case in this cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.818" offset="5886621">They even decided to make some other use of the property then in the plaintiff's view, once they were ordered to leave the property, they will be entitled to relocation benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.698" offset="5930193">We say that isn't the case because the key element, the key factor that triggers this act would be missing which would be that the displacement would not have been caused by the acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.392" offset="5976900">Now, we find support for our interpretation of the Act in the language of the statute in the context and structure of the statute and in the legislative history of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.861" offset="6030817">Before I go into the language of the statute, I'd like to underscore one point about its context which as -- is that the Uniform Relocation Act is actually part of a much broader statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.573" offset="6081703">It's Title 2 of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Land, excuse me, and Real Property Acquisition Policy's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.365" offset="6124857">In other words this Act deals with the problems of real property acquisition by the federal government and by state governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.405" offset="6164982">The Act was passed in order to remedy some of the problems, some of the inadequacies that were perceived in eminent domain law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.512" offset="6205419">Eminent domain law does not provide benefits to take care of incidental and consequential expenses that are suffered by people who are forced to move as result of acquisitions of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.143" offset="6259963">Congress tried to deal with this problem and a number of other problems and eminent domain law with this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.331" offset="6284727">Title 3 addresses a number of these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.055" offset="6295594">Title 2 addresses what Congress perceives it's the most serious problem which was the problem of relocation of people who are displaced by acquisitions of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.909" offset="6338957">Now, going to the precise language that the plaintiffs rely on, they rely on the definition of displaced persons in the Act and particularly on the written order clause, indeed exclusively on the written order clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.024" offset="6407502">Now, the two clauses have been over the acquisition clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.285" offset="6432475">The second clause, the written order clause says that a person is entitled to -- well a person is defined as a displaced person if he moves as the result of the written order of an acquiring agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.733" offset="6490258">Now, the plaintiffs say that this includes them because HUD had acquired the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.206" offset="6512201">We interpret the words acquiring agency to mean an agency that is acquiring an agency that is engaged in an acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.251" offset="6552325">In other words, as we read just these words without going any farther we say acquiring agency has to be an agency that is more or less contemporaneously engaged in an acquisition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1627.785" offset="6614497">Exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.540" offset="6617527">The -- I think if we look further into the statute, we find further support for this interpretation of the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.017" offset="6651486">Particularly, important I think, it is to look at the operative sections of the Act, the sections that grant the actual benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.570" offset="6685654">When we look to them we find that those sections actually talk in terms of acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.009" offset="6711359">They don't contemplate people in the position of the plaintiffs and that's the best key I think to what this written order clause really means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.560" offset="6749602">For example, Section 202 of the Act which is 4622, I believe in the U.S. Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.620" offset="6781889">Section 202 applies to moving expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.702" offset="6798190">Now, Section 202 provides for moving expenses for people who in which the acquisition will result in a displacement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.064" offset="6859630">It doesn't contemplate people for whom the acquisition occurred long ago and who are being displaced by written order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.749" offset="6890350">It turns on the existence of an acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.300" offset="6904560">Now, the plaintiffs say that this is just sloppy language and that it doesn't cover our interpretation of the written order clause either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.010" offset="6939460">Now, our interpretation of the written order clause is just this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.707" offset="6958164">We say that the written order clause was designed to take care of the case in which there was a notice to move in anticipation of the acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.812" offset="7002572">But in fact the acquisition never took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.775" offset="7014484">Now, there's a very good reason that that written order clause is in the statute which is to take an example, suppose Mr. Jones got an order from the Department of Transportation, "Jones we're going to be taking your property and in two months it's going to be acquired be out by June 15."</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.166" offset="7088044">And Jones, in reliance on this, logically enough, reasonably enough decided he'd better move and he moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.310" offset="7116570">Now, if the statute had only the acquisition clause and it turned out that the Department of transportation decided after Jones had moved that they weren't going to take the property after all, Jones would be out of lack.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.473" offset="7169233">That's why the written order clause is in the statute to make sure that if the Department of Transportation gives Jones a notice, get out by June 15 and Jones moves in reliance on that, it doesn't matter if there is an acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.741" offset="7226284">And that he is right in to the benefit sections of the Act because Section 202, the moving expenses section provides that benefits are available when the acquisition will result in displacement and in Mr. Jones' case, it is certainly the case that the acquisition will result in his displacement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.783" offset="7310503">Even though in fact, this things turned out no acquisition took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.492" offset="7329311">Same thing applies to the relocation assistance advisory services that are discussed in Section 205 of the Act which is 4625.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.357" offset="7380825">Now, again, it uses language that the benefits are available when the acquisition will result in the displacement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.136" offset="7419904">This wouldn't apply to the parties, to the plaintiffs in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.018" offset="7439444">That -- this clearly indicates that acquisition is the key here and that of course, as we say, our interpretation of the written order clause is consistent with us again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.692" offset="7478105">Similarly, the third operative section applies the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.733" offset="7494301">It's a somewhat different language but again it points to the key factor of acquisition as being the heart of this statute and that is Section 204 which is 4624 which provides benefits to persons who are living in their dwellings at least 90 days before the initiation of negotiations for the acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.538" offset="7593566">Now, if HUD had acquired this property 20 years ago that statute wouldn't make any sense if applied in the sense that the plaintiffs are trying to make it apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.521" offset="7645497">Because this clearly contemplates that the acquisition is the core notion of what triggers the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.146" offset="7676008">In other words, the reason for the 90-day gap, the 90-day period here, that's specified in the statute is that the Act wants to avoid people coming in two days before the acquisition after they've heard that the acquisition was coming and getting relocation benefits but it turns basically again on acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.298" offset="7776528">Now, looking to the legislative history of this Act, we see the same point underscored again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.952" offset="7827205">This legislative history is quite extensive and we've gone through it in some detail in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.912" offset="7863045">But I like to touch on just a few points here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.032" offset="7879450">First, the beginning of the consideration of this problem came essentially in about 1961 when the House Public Works Committee set up a select sub-committee on real property acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.124" offset="7959907">Now, again note and I harp on this theme again and again but it is the core of the case that this sub-committee was devoted to the problem of real property acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.246" offset="8004315">The sub-committee came up with the proposal, a proposed statute which is entitled the “Fair Compensation Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.070" offset="8039633">Now as I've mentioned, this Fair Compensation Act was part of the effort to try to make amendments make some kind of improvements on bare constitutional eminent domain law, to try to solve some of the harshness that eminent domain law produced in various respects by paying only for the fair market value of property that was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.339" offset="8148720">One of the purposes or one of the aspects that this Act addressed was the problem of relocation and interestingly, it included a section on relocation which is very similar in structure to the sections on relocation that appear in the Uniform Relocation Act and in fact, although the Relocation Act has provided in some respects more extensive benefits but the basic core was here and what was particularly important is that the core definitional section was similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.791" offset="8318516">What the definitional section said was that benefits are available to persons who move as the result of an acquisition or the eminence of the acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.120" offset="8375881">Now, the interesting thing about this is that this is the grandfather of the written order clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.380" offset="8396884">We find again and again the definition of displaced persons coming up as a person who is displaced as the result of an acquisition or and then slightly changed language as we go through the development of the Act through its numerous drafts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.710" offset="8462190">But it started with our eminence of acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.591" offset="8473788">In other words, they were dealing with precisely the kind of problem we are trying to identify here which is our friend, Jones, who leaves in reliance on an acquisition coming down the road, any acquisition never actually takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.627" offset="8533870">Eminence of acquisition, well that phrase was thought to be too broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.511" offset="8553409">It's just too vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.404" offset="8556962">What is eminence of acquisition to somebody who get benefits if he has a feeling that, well, I have a feeling they're going to be taking my property, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.036" offset="8587473">He gets benefits only if there's some, there's got to be some better way to figure when the acquisition is in fact eminent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.434" offset="8621119">So that although eminence of acquisition was the statutorial language that was introduced in the first bills following this Fair Compensation Act, supposed it was changed fairly quickly to reasonable expectation of acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.995" offset="8695306">So the Act read a person is displaced if he is displaced by the bill at that time, if he is displaced as the result of an acquisition or reasonable expectation of acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.985" offset="8751313">Now, that went through several drafts of the bill basically unchanged until we got down to 1969 in which the bill finally made its way into law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.240" offset="8808364">There was a difference interestingly between the Senate Bill that was first introduced and the House Bill that was first introduced first in this last round of drafts of the Relocation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.671" offset="8862072">The Senate Bill retained this language that one is displaced if one is required to move as a result of an acquisition or reasonable expectation of acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.170" offset="8908048">Whereas the House Bill that was initially introduced was somewhat more restrictive, it said that one is displaced if one is forced to move as a result of an acquisition or reasonable expectation of acquisition when the property is subsequently acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.874" offset="8990908">So again, under the House Bill, Mr. Jones will be out of lack again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.267" offset="9008462">Well, the -- it was clear that there was a good deal of difference between these two positions and they were compromised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.347" offset="9048795">They were compromised in what became the written order clause ant that is that what happened was just this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.334" offset="9084740">That the written order clause is drafted to say, alright, it will be the requirement that there be a reasonable expectation of acquisition is too broad by standing by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.987" offset="9151300">There ought to be some index of probability of acquisition so we'll say that there has to be a written order to move but the requirement in the House Bill that the acquisition actually take place is too restrictive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.225" offset="9220263">So we'll simply eliminate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.150" offset="9227995">And so what they came up with was as I say just this written order clause requiring that there be some kind of written order to move but not requiring that the property subsequently be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.176" offset="9288077">Now, we have pointed out our interpretation of the written order clause as being a good deal narrower than the position that the plaintiffs have taken in respect to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.468" offset="9377207">I would like to point out that HUD's position is and has been and continues to be consistent with the recent Act that the plaintiffs have brought to the attention of the Court that we attempt to limit displacements of people as much as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.295" offset="9464560">It's clear that these kinds of displacements cause terrible hardship and there's no question about that in the hardships that Mr. Vanderstar recited at the beginning of the hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.487" offset="9525269">We certainly acknowledged that this is a serious social problem and one which HUD has tried to address by restricting displacements as much as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.954" offset="9571140">But the problem is that many of these housing projects were built 30 or 40 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.308" offset="9596635">They are in deteriorating condition and some of them are beyond rehabilitation in any practical sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.016" offset="9627460">So that occasionally, these properties do have to be basically torn down that rehabilitation really would amount to simply rebuilding from the ground up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.952" offset="9683153">So there are people that do get displace.</text>

            <text syncTime="2637.164" offset="10651982">I don't know whether why it's relevant that some of these properties are 30 or 40 years old the fact that as Riverhouse was built in 1969 and HUD has held the mortgage since December 1970 if there's been any deterioration, I don't know why the fingers are being pointed but perhaps that's the place to point the finger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.242" offset="10720319">I do want to talk for a moment about Mr. Jones though because the Government's position is that the language of the written order clause applies to a proposed but unconsummated acquisition and to a displacement that results from a written notice of intent to acquire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.641" offset="10789909">But the statute doesn't say written notice that says written order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.828" offset="10806732">Furthermore, the Government relies very heavily on the word acquisition in the Sections of the statute other than the definition of sections that provide the specific benefits and services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.007" offset="10855424">Now, I might point out that we conceive there was acquisition in this case than we conceive that one is required so we don't have a difference between us on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.567" offset="10893667">But the question is if the acquisition resulted in the displacement, then the acquisition clause applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.532" offset="10929507">The question before the Court is what happens if something else resulted in the displacement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.009" offset="10963362">If it was a written order not the acquisition but a written order and we suggest that's exactly why Congress put the written order clause in the definitional section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.680" offset="11006098">Because if you had to wait for an acquisition to cause the displacement, you wouldn't need the written order clause.</text>
