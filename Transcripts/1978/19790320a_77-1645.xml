            <label>Mr. John M. Anderson</label>
            <text syncTime="97.011" offset="387971">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.161" offset="392568">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.137" offset="404480">The case now before the Court Transamerica Mortgage Advisors versus Lewis presents a narrow technical question of law and a broad important question of judicial policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.018" offset="460069">The question of law presented is whether Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 affords of private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.477" offset="509806">The question of judicial policy presented is whether this Court should imply a private right of action under the Advisers Act and then leave to further litigation resolution of such questions as who may bring the action, who may be the defendant, who may be sued for what breaches of what duties as well questions of reliance, causation and intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.541" offset="622132">This Court is being asked to interpret the statute but I submit that it is being asked in a larger sense to assess its law in the application of federal securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.839" offset="667272">This Court is not being asked to deny relief to those clients of Investment Advisers who have been victims of the Advisers deceit or negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.792" offset="711158">Ample federal and state remedies already exist for the redress of the grievances by clients of Investment Advisers.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.439" offset="745744">This Court is not being asked to read the Investment Act narrowly or restrictively in violation of the principal announced in the Borak case.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.643" offset="786495">We do simply urge that this Act be read at it was written by the Congress and as it has been amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.245" offset="820976">The facts of this case briefly are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.728" offset="838844">The case came to Court in April 1973 with the suit by the plaintiff and respondent, Harry Lewis, asking legal and equitable relief for alleged violations of the Investment Advisers Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.555" offset="894119">The lawsuit was cast as both a derivative action on behalf of Mortgage Trust of America, a real estate investment trust and as a class action on behalf of the shareholders of Mortgage Trust of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.941" offset="955664">The petitioners moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim and argued that since Mortgage Trust of America wasn't is a mortgage lender which does not deal in securities within the meaning of the federal securities law.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.846" offset="1019298">It was not subject to the Investment Advisers Act at 1940 that further, since Transamerica Mortgage Advisors is not a public investment adviser in any sense of those words, it's not subject to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.103" offset="1080320">We further argued that the respondent had failed to make proper demand on the trustees of Mortgage Trust of America and finally, we argued that the Advisers Act does not afford a private right of action in any of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.430" offset="1133714">The District Court noted the petitioner's arguments or had what we're called the substantial merit but ruled that since the Advisers Act does not afford a private right of action, there was no need to decide the other arguments advanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.474" offset="1193796">On appeal, petitioners again argued that the investment Advisers Act does not apply to the petitioners or the facts in this case and that there is no private right of action in any event.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="310.755" offset="1243011">Is the question whether or not there's a private right of action or whether or not there's a private right of action for money damages?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_anderson" startTime="317.352" stopTime="331.478">
            <label>Mr. John M. Anderson</label>
            <text syncTime="317.352" offset="1269342">The question is whether or not there's a private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.267" offset="1281045">The question is recently post in the petition for cert Mr. Justice Stewart, was whether or not there was a private right of action impairing the brief, we know the question to whether private right of action for money damages.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <label>Mr. John M. Anderson</label>
            <text syncTime="334.141" offset="1336529">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.839" offset="1339350">The reason for the narrowing of the question which I believe to be proper within the meaning of the Court's rules was that the Court of Appeal decision which is in question here from the Ninth Circuit was based on and simply incorporated the decision of the Second Circuit in the case called Abrahamson versus Fleschner, and that case was devoted exclusively to the consideration of whether or not there was a private right of action for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.326" offset="1425241">Equitable issues were not present in that case or equitable claims are not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.394" offset="1441541">And for that reason, we know that also because much of the claim for equitable relief in this case seemed to be moot and for that reason we deemed that to be the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.299" offset="1481143">Nonetheless, we, Mr. Justice Stewart has suggested incurred the raft of our opponents in their brief and for that reason in our reply brief, we adjust the problem across the board broadly both equitable and legal relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="423.886" offset="1695451">That is correct and we did for the reason explained to Mr. Stewart because of the incorporation of the decision in the Abrahamson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.140" offset="1724500">But to be clear and to emphasize the question before the Court is whether there is a right to legal or equitable relief by implication under the Advisers Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="458.321" offset="1833273">But I will agree with our opponents that that would be an anomalous result and I think would lead to more difficulties than it would solve.</text>

            <text syncTime="492.275" offset="1969006">And that Commission as being given broad power to seek injunctive relief and I think that's the reason for that particular provision on the Act, a point which I will stress later in this argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. John M. Anderson</label>
            <text syncTime="711.635" offset="2846511">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.507" offset="2849959">And it is also true that in the Ninth Circuit decision, the Court talks of both legal and equitable relief notwithstanding the fact that it was simply incorporating the decision or ruling of the Second Circuit in the Abrahamson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.448" offset="2917773">In the appeal to the Ninth Circuit, we argued again that the facts of this case do not lend themselves to application of the Advisers Act in any event and that there was no private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.531" offset="2970122">The Court of Appeals declined to decide the other issues advanced and with one judge dissenting ruled that the implication of a private right of action for injunctive relief and damages under the Advisers Act in favor of appropriate plaintiffs is necessary to achieve the goals of Congress in enacting the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.281" offset="3053087">The Court of Appeals opinion as I indicated simply adopts wholesale.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.401" offset="3081509">The opinion of the Second Circuit both the majority opinion and the dissenting opinion in the case of Abrahamson versus Fleschner.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.533" offset="3114109">Now, it seems to me that the resolution of this case entails first, consideration of the special wording of the Advisers Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.375" offset="3145456">And I want to stress that the Advisers Act is unique among all the federal securities acts in the grant of jurisdiction not simply in limiting to the question of actions at -- or the elimination of expression actions of law but in the phrase which follows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.832" offset="3235318">And I wish to emphasize this because it has not been a matter of extended treatments on the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.625" offset="3254439">But in the Advisers Act, the jurisdictions conferred “of all suits and equity to enjoin any violation of the Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="823.542" offset="3294145">It does not confer jurisdiction over actions of law or actions other than suits and equity to enjoin all of the other federal securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.021" offset="3336046">The 33 Act, the 34 Act and the other security action question also refer to jurisdiction of all suits and equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.419" offset="3401665">There is a significant and I believe to be important distinction in the nature of the jurisdiction which is conferred between the 1940 Act and the 1933 and the 1934 Act in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.817" offset="3455164">The second matter which I believe must be resolved here is the consideration of the factors that pointed out in this of course 1975 opinion, the case of Cort versus Ash in which the Court specified or suggested factors to be considered in determining whether or not an act not expressly providing the private right of action would nonetheless afford implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.075" offset="3560281">In doing that kind of analysis which I do not intend to date to belabor the -- it seems to me that the most important aspect to that is attention to the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.543" offset="3602077">The legislative history of the Investment Advisers Act belies any suggestion that Congress thought initially or has thought since that it ought it to be the basis for private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.603" offset="3654322">And finally, I would submit that the Court ought to consider the results it would follow if this Court were to imply a private right of action under the Advisers Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.210" offset="3716807">The original legislation in 1940 began with an FCC Bill which contains standard jurisdictional language which included reference to jurisdiction over suits and equity and actions at law.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.301" offset="3777202">The same language that was in the 1933 and the 1934 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.292" offset="3797159">Following negotiation and hearing, a compromise was reached and arranged on various aspects of the Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.052" offset="3824118">And one of the changes made was that the language actions at law with respect to duties and violations of the act was eliminated and we are now have the statute which is before us which refers only to suits and equity to enjoined any violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.126" offset="3896424">Secondly, and there's another important distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.014" offset="3911993">From it's inception in 1940, the Investment Advisers Act has never had any provision for express civil liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.497" offset="3949923">Unlike that 1993 Act and unlike the 1934 Act, the Investment Advisers Act does not provide any express liability in any of its provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.978" offset="3999869">In 1960, the Advisers Act was amended and the Securities and Exchange Commission was given additional enforcement powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.482" offset="4041874">But the grant and jurisdiction or the limitation of jurisdiction if you will was not changed, it remained the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.230" offset="4072908">And in 1970, there was I believe to be the most important and direct announcement by the Congress as to the meaning or intention with respect to the Advisers Act when the Congress added a private right of action to the companion statute, that's the Investment Company Act at 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.119" offset="4148454">And they added an express private right of action to that legislation and further specified in adding that express right of action who may be the plaintiff, who may be the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.850" offset="4195370">The nature of the duty that would be violated giving rights to the action, they allocated the burden of proof, they establish evidentiary standards and finally they prescribe the damages which may be recovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.484" offset="4253884">This was all done in 1970 at the time amendments were being made to both the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.517" offset="4286067">No creation of express civil liability, no creation of an express private right of action was had under the Advisers Act even though it was done very specifically and deliberately under the Investment Company Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1100.351" offset="4401319">But the fact is that it has been proposed and was most recently proposed as a matter of fact in 1976 by the Securities and Exchange Commission and there's been no action taken on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.829" offset="4451265">I'd like to turn now if I may to the results that would follow if this Court were to imply a private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.227" offset="4480836">Because of the special wording of the Investors Advisers Act, it would create at a minimum a hornet's nest of litigation because it cannot help it but create a series of unanswered questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.286" offset="4533081">The Investment Advisers Act Section 206, the basis for the claim of an implied right of action in this case refers to wrongdoing against clients of Investment Advisers or prospective clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.251" offset="4596924">The keywords of course are prospective clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.220" offset="4608836">And the first question it must come to mind is what is meant by prospective clients?</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.262" offset="4625032">I submit that the use of that phrase is consistent with conferral of authority and jurisdiction on the Securities and Exchange Commission to seek relief against Investment Advisers who are soliciting business going after business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.623" offset="4686472">It is, I think equally inconsistent with the notion that it could be from that could be implied a right of private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.993" offset="4719909">The first question being of course, who are prospective clients of Investment Advisers?</text>

            <text syncTime="1203.230" offset="4812904">And it seems to me that the use of prospective clients belies any suggestion that was intended that this Act confer jurisdiction on people who could claim that they might have been an Adviser a client of the Investment Adviser if they but known what good advice or what bad advice he was going to give.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.916" offset="4883644">I mean it seems to me that it simply creates an open-ended class of plaintiffs without limits as Judge Gurfein suggested in his dissent in the Abrahamson case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1456.366" offset="5825411">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.427" offset="5845682">In sharing our time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we will concentrate our all aspects of the case except the third of the Cort against Ash criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.083" offset="5900330">The necessity or the importance of supplementation of Government activity which area would be covered primarily by the Government in the time it has to argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.307" offset="5949127">We would like to state first by re-identifying this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.987" offset="5975876">The complaint in this action is primarily and always was a classic bill inequity seeking a declaration of rightness of a contract between an investment adviser and the advisee to wit the Mortgage Trust of America which we've called in our brief MTA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.074" offset="6056229">It also seeks restitution of the consideration paid under that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.683" offset="6078694">On the grounds, that the contract was at all times in violation of the Investment Advisers Act at 1940 including Section 206 and of course that relief arises under 215 Bill of the Act providing the contracts in violation of the Act to practices under contracts and violation of the Act are void.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.607" offset="6158420">This is the primary relief sought in this action and always was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.929" offset="6171690">Now, the respondent has said, some of this is moot because we never sought preliminary relief even though the contract has been re-moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.704" offset="6206798">It was rather difficult to move for preliminary injunction on the basis on the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.788" offset="6223099">It's been dismissed for one subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.437" offset="6237727">The equitable relief sought is in no sense moot, it is the Government of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.926" offset="6259670">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled the sense very narrowly and quite properly it reached only the issue otherwise before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.803" offset="6303138">The District Court had dismissed the complaint for one of subject matter jurisdiction, finding that there was no private right of action under the Advisers Act no matter how cast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.939" offset="6343680">And the Court of Appeals disagreed and therefore it reversed and said that in the proper case there could be a private right of action for injunctive relief, equitable relief or damages and it got no farther.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.055" offset="6400209">It adopted the rational of Abrahamson because Abrahamson is a very, very different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.762" offset="6422988">Abrahamson was a suit that could only be characterized as suit at worth the money damages arising out of participations in a hedge fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.394" offset="6461544">And this Court denied certiorari in that case, in Abrahamson and as we have said in our brief, we respectfully contend that this would be a peculiar case and at most a futile record in which to attempt to re-litigate Abrahamson.</text>

            <text syncTime="1674.681" offset="6698632">This Court must allow an action cast in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.751" offset="6714932">This is not to say that we don't think it is proper to imply such as an action and I will get within the next couple of minutes to the question where there anything at all much as anything important is to be drawn from whatever happen to Section 214 as the Advisers Act in the few weeks that it was considered by a committee but presented really nearly to the floor after some rather rapid redrafting in the summer of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.360" offset="6825378">But at the very least, the relief we say a bill in equity which what this case is lies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.361" offset="6849411">Now, we have agreed that the Cort against Ash criteria that is the Commission have agreed to cast argument among those lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.852" offset="6879399">And we think the first of the criteria expressed by this Court whether the statute in question was passed for the special benefit of a particular class of persons and whether as this Court itself explained that, that means whether it creates a federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.875" offset="6943451">Now, we think that in this instance that the Advisers Act creates a federal right on behalf of the clients of Investment Advisers within the context of the advisory relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.520" offset="6994024">It is obvious and manifest and we're not going to belabor it what is in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.900" offset="7011579">This Court itself from the Capital Gains Research Bureau case analyzed the meaning based on debt the passage of the Advisers Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.747" offset="7050971">Nothing has happened in the interim to change that analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.091" offset="7064346">Congress was concerned about the relationship interest they say between the advisor and the client advisee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.415" offset="7093603">It was not concerned in passing the Advisers Act in all due respect to petitioners with the purchase and sale of securities by the advisor on behalf of the advisee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.752" offset="7130906">It was concerned and it was seriously concerned with the relationship interest they say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.201" offset="7152744">One of the things in the legislative history perhaps, very significant in this case which one of the things Congress expressed its concern about in both the Senate Reports and House Report was the kind of compensation arrangements that advisors dealt with themselves with their advisees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.397" offset="7217528">Were they as the FCC have warned in this 1939 state dealing themselves compensation arrangements which encourage them to go out to and take onto investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.599" offset="7258384">Now, the most common in those days were contingent ones which are of course prohibited as to registered advisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.923" offset="7279595">More common today and the -- were yesterday is another brief era of the ascendancy of the real estate investment trust was the compensation contract based at least in part upon undisbursed commitments which encourage the practice of heavy forward committing, borrowing (Inaudible), with incurring reverse leverage so that in order to expand your fee base you borrowed money for more than you could get for it if you had committed sufficiently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.880" offset="7399445">Now, of course much of that is no longer important in the investment community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.032" offset="7416059">But the interface relationship, the way a compensation arrangement in a designed was definitely a concern of both Houses Congress at least the cognizant committees in 1939 and 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.700" offset="7466736">Now, the special benefit whether was no other beneficiary of this Act except of course for the sovereign interests in that integrity of securities markets in the health of the capital markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.222" offset="7512816">The class of persons whether individual or corporate or some other kind of entity to be protected and Congress said it again and again each of the reports in the hearings and Senator Wagner's statements was to protect the investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.187" offset="7568718">This is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.892" offset="7575510">What form of remedies they might seek is no part of the question much less the answer?</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.565" offset="7606230">Once the federal right is created, it is nothing uncommon for the legislature to leave a method of its protection to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.742" offset="7654922">We contended it has long been accepted by legislatures that the special genius for designing remedy is judicial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2703.527" offset="10814067">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.016" offset="10827964">The Securities and Exchange Commission believes that an implied remedy for damages caused by violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act is consistent with the Act's legislative scheme and necessary to achieve effectively its goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.591" offset="10894315">As you have already heard, a primary congressional purpose underlying the enactment of the Investment Advisers Act particularly its anti-fraud provisions was to eliminate fraud in overreaching by investment advisers abuses which had compromised the interest of advisory clients and derogation of the delicate fiduciary nature of an advisory relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.588" offset="10986266">Judicial recognition of an implied rate of action here will effectuate that congressional goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.859" offset="11015419">Far from interfering with the Act's regulatory scheme or its enforcement by the Commission in the manner explicitly provided for in the statute, Section 206, I'm sorry, implying a right of action under Section 206 the Advisers Act would serve as necessary supplement to governmental action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.293" offset="11089084">Without a private remedy, statutory objectives would be frustrated congressionally provided protections for advisory clients will be significantly diminished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.072" offset="11132238">Like Section 10 (b) of the Securities and Exchange Act, Section 206 of the Advisers Act is a general anti-fraud provision and across the board prohibition of the countless varieties of deceptions and cutting devices to which clients have investment advisers might be subjected and all who need the statutory definition of advisor including those who are exempt from registration by the Commission are covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.713" offset="11230772">Section 206 is therefore a provision intended and structured by the legislators to provide broad protections to the clients of investment advisers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.695" offset="11274762">To the clients of investment advisers, Congress clearly articulated a federal right in that special class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.895" offset="11311543">Because of this specific congressional purpose, Section 206 in some respects is more limited than the anti-fraud provisions of Section 10 (b) of the Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.351" offset="11353339">For example, Section 206 is limited in its applicability to an advisor's relationship with his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.796" offset="11383118">On the other hand, the limitations contained in Section 10 (b) at the fraud being connection with the purchase and sale of a security is not a prerequisite since Congress recognized that fraud by advisor may take forms which should not always directly relate to the purchase and sale of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.171" offset="11456679">Thus, the legislative history of the Act repeatedly emphasizes the need to protect the special class of clients from unscrupulous and fraudulent practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.617" offset="11502446">By 1940 of course, Congress had enacted a full panoply of securities lost which were in part designed to prevent fraudulent practices yet Congress proceed the deficiency and the legislative scheme and that it was not as effective at it could be in preventing the types of abuses that a grown up in the investment advisory field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.997" offset="11587918">Congress intended to remedy this deficiency and this Court has directed lower courts that it is their duty to provide such remedies are necessary to effectuate the congressional purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.091" offset="11632327">It is therefore significant to the Commission that each of the three appellate courts that have considered the issue presented here and the overwhelming number of district courts that have done so have concluded that a private remedy is both appropriate and necessary to achieve the goals underlying the Investment Advisers Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.236" offset="11700872">And as the Fifth Circuit has stated in the Wilson case, there are no less drastic and more closely tailored means by which to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.290" offset="11733159">We submit that the many Courts that have considered this issue have been faithful to the Court's direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.422" offset="11753639">There are, as this Court has pointed of course, circumstances in which a private remedy would not only fail to contribute to furthering the legislative scheme but would also actually interfere with Congress' intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.539" offset="11806093">But we do not have in these circumstances we do not have in this case an assertion of a private remedy by one that the statute was meant to regulate as we had in the Piper case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.318" offset="11849247">Here the clients of the advisers were intended to benefit from the statute and that's who's bringing the action nor do we have a situation in which private enforcement would not be harmonious with the exercise of the enforcement powers entrusted to governmental agencies as well as the case in Amtrak and Barbour.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.288" offset="11917061">It has been the Commission's consistent experience that even where allegations in the separate private damage action parallel the Commission action and on enforcement proceeding, private remedies do not interfere with their own enforcement activities and of course many private actions are brought where the Commission does not or because of limited resources could not institute its own proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.575" offset="12010266">We recognize of course, that in administrative institutional invitations alone do not justify the implication of private remedies but an appreciation of the dimensions of the enforcement fraud problems faced by the Commission and how that problem has changed through the years is useful to an understanding of the depths of the problems that are faced today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.027" offset="12088007">As in Borak, one measure of the necessity for a private action is to provide, I should say, is provided by the scope of the practical problems that the agency faces in attempting to administer the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.830" offset="12139311">In 1940, the investment adviser industry was indeed to fledgling profession that emerged in response to depression and the public's perceived need for investment expertise to supervise his investments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.625" offset="12186436">But that fledgling profession has experience dramatic growth since 1940 and recent statistics indicate that that is a continuing trend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.497" offset="12217887">In 1941, barely 750 advisers registered with the Commission under the Investment Advisers Act as compared to approximately 6,000 broker dealers that were registered with the Commission back in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.215" offset="12272849">Currently, the Commission's records put the number of registered investment adviser and that is not the entire universe of adviser but the number of registered investment advisers at 5500, almost equaling the number of registered broker dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.568" offset="12326243">Perhaps, even more indicative of the importance of the advisory industry to the nation's affairs international economy is the growth of the assets under advisement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.640" offset="12366472">Well the number of adviser's increases sevenfold since 1941, the amount of assets under advisement has increase 50 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.299" offset="12397192">Today, there are $200 billion under advisement and it must be taken into account that unlike overseeing and disciplining the broker dealer community where the Exchange Act provided for a commission and self-regulatory partnership and enforcing the Act, the Commission must bear the primary responsibility for regulating and enforcing the provisions of the Investment Advisers Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.925" offset="12503667">Moreover, the enforcement of role, as I said a moment ago, extends to all those who meet the definition of adviser including the many advisers who exempt from the Act's registration provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.743" offset="12546926">For various reasons not limited to the scarcity of available resources, the Commission must carefully choose the cases it brings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.030" offset="12572108">Even in those cases, it does bring moreover, it is normally impossible for the Commission to obtain redress for undue to investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.228" offset="12596872">As Mr. Justice Stevens had pointed out, it is fundamental to our adversary system that selfish interests of litigants provide the best guarantee that a claim will be effectively asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.125" offset="12636473">Certainly, it is true that there is no placement so effective as the one whose pocketbook is affected by the degree to which he enforces the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.251" offset="12668970">As we have pointed out, many of the reasons was compelled like a conclusion that a private rate of action should be available on the Advisers Act also, I'm sorry, I mean the Exchange Act also militate for the conclusion that a private action should be provided under the Advisers Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3575.433" offset="14301727">However, in the 33 and 34 Act where there are creations of express rights of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.249" offset="14324924">Those provisions providing those express rights of action create and have in them those very sections conferral of jurisdiction and so it seems to me that the significance is not the omission of the inclusion for that purpose but to suggest a broader range of remedies available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.869" offset="14395455">There are a few numbers of suits against Real Estate Investment Trust because of the uncertainty as to whether or not a private right of action exists under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.059" offset="14428160">That I think is the answer to the fact that they are only some 15 suits that we've been able to find in recent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.855" offset="14451357">As the Court may know the district courts have been divided on this issue and all of the Courts of appeals which have conceded this, there has been a strong dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.763" offset="14495033">With respect to Judge Gurfein's comment that there might be equitable relief available, it should be pointed out that equitable relief has an issue was not in that case but more importantly, I think it would be anomalous for this Court to conclude that there might be equitable relief because the existence of equitable relief presupposes, under standard equitable principles the existence or the absence of adequate legal relief and I think it would be on that technical legal ground, it would be inconsistent to do so but more importantly as we point out in this case since there is a prayer here for rescission, the line between equitable relief and money damage relief is bound to be blurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.409" offset="14661590">The Securities and Exchange Commission refers to the only other case in which this Court has considered the Investment Advisers Act namely the Capital Gains case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.675" offset="14690638">In the Capital Gains case, this Court held that the Commission need not show intentional rueful misconduct the old fashioned fraud in order to obtain an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.207" offset="14732748">Are we to understand from that that a private litigant seeking injunctive relief also would not have to sell old fashioned fraud, intentional conduct and if that is the case, does it not undermine this Court's ruling in the Hochfelder case where the limitation on the kind of conduct that could be proscribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.053" offset="14808189">The argument is made in this case that the Advisers Act at least provides for equitable relief that is based on Section 215 (b) of the Advisers Act and as we submit and discuss at length in the red reply brief that argument is base on misreadings of that section and does not account for the fact that that section was undoubtedly based on state law in which the voidability provision was available as a defense for someone seeking to enforce an adviser contract did not confer necessarily or by experience a right to affirmative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.409" offset="14969626">The Advisers Act, unlike the 1933 and 1934 Act does not purport to regulate the marketing of securities generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.081" offset="15000242">It is aimed to the small specific segment of the securities industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.732" offset="15018841">It is aimed instead at its special relationship rather than arrange of transactions and we submit that that he used 1933 and 1934 Act principles in wholesale interpretation of the Advisers Act simply because they are both of three, are all three are federal securities law is misleading and inappropriate given their different aims and different purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.408" offset="15109538">Accepting the premise that the Advisers Act was intended to protect clients of investment advisers, it is ironic I think, that if this Court were to imply a private right of action under that Act, it would plunge those litigants, those claimants, those clients of investment advisers into years of unknown litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.443" offset="15189682">And I say unknown as to who may bring the suit, who may be a defendant, who may be sued, what are the standards for causation, and what are the questions for intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.619" offset="15226462">How much more it would benefit the investors -- how much more would benefit the clients of investment advisers if the federal court which will leave to Congress the task of weighing and considering those very questions as the Congress itself did in 1970 and its evaluation of the Investment Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.017" offset="15307964">It seems to me that the beneficiaries of the Act, namely the clients of investment advisers would benefit more from refusing to imply a right -- a private right of action here and allowing the Congress to weigh and to evaluate the remedies before opening the door to witless, protracted, private litigation in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.875" offset="15387481">Thank you.</text>
