            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="14.792" offset="59141">This case comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.178" offset="76696">It presents the question as to the application of the Federal Securities Acts to noncontributory compulsory pension plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.833" offset="119327">Under the plan at issue, contributions to a pension fund were made by the employer based on the number of weeks worked by employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.181" offset="164676">Upon accepting employment, an employee was automatically covered by the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.828" offset="191216">As it was noncontributory, he paid no money into the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.665" offset="214622">The employee was required however to have 20 years of continuous service to be entitled to a pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.665" offset="250567">Respondent in this case was employed for more than 20 years but because his service was entirely continuous, he did not qualify for a pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.216" offset="300826">He thereupon brought this suit against the international union, the local to which he belonged and the pension fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.515" offset="341995">He alleged that petitioners had misrepresented and failed to disclose material facts about the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.097" offset="376372">He charged common law fraud, violation of the National Labor Relations Act and violation of the Federal Securities Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.526" offset="418064">We are concerned in this case only with the claim under the Securities Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.741" offset="450873">The application of these Acts turns upon whether the employee's interest in the pension plan is a security as that term is defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.088" offset="496327">Respondent argued successfully before the Court of Appeals that his interest in the plan was an investment contract within the definition of the term security. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.845" offset="563304">A noncontributory compulsory pension plan is not a security within the meaning of the Federal Securities Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.922" offset="599667">We base our decision on the plain language of these statutes on the standards applied in our prior cases and on the actions over the years by the Congress, by the SEC with respect to pension plans of the type involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.910" offset="675631">We express no opinion as to respondent's entitlement to proceed on the other counts set forth in his complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.684" offset="710635">The Chief Justice has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.735" offset="722860">And Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
