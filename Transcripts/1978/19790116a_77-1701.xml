            <label>Mr. William M. Leech</label>
            <text syncTime="15.589" offset="165700">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.275" offset="196524">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.014" offset="219408">This case had its origin, or its genesis in late October of 1972, when the respondents in this case were arrested for murder in Shelby County for a homicide committed in Tipton County, Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.831" offset="302686">They were indicted on November of 1972, before the Grand Jury of Tipton County which was chaired by an acting foreman who had been appointed by the Trial Judge under Tennessee System of appointing the foreman of the Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.081" offset="387741">The acting foreman was accompanied on the Grand Jury by 12 other grand jurors selected from the general venire list of Tipton County.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.468" offset="429223">There was a pro se plea in abatement to that indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.014" offset="451480">A hearing was held in the Trial Court and evidence was taken, the Trial Judge overruled the plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.020" offset="491499">It went on to trial and the conviction was had against both respondents and each was sentenced to 60 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.476" offset="529324">The respondents then perfected their appeal to the intermediate Court of Criminal Appeals, and the Court of Criminal Appeals considered the same assignments of error in their original plea which attacked the method of selecting the foreman of the Grand Jury and that the plea originally alleged systematic exclusion in the appointment of the acting Grand Jury by the Trial Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.334" offset="644681">The Court of Appeals ruled favorable for the state and against the plea, it then was appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court certiorari was denied and a per curium opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.990" offset="691284">The Court found that the case had been adequately dealt with that the Court of Criminal Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.009" offset="731408">Thereafter in 1975 petitions were filed by respondents and the District Court at Memphis for petitions of habeas corpus, writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.828" offset="774666">Thereafter the reference to the magistrate was had by Judge Bailey Brown on the bench and the magistrate did take proof, responses, the trial were filed, the trial record was filed and affidavits were submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.651" offset="837987">Subsequently the case was dismissed by the District Court and that the District Court found that the foreman of the Grand Jury had been selected for other reasons than racial.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.257" offset="896397">In essence the proof before the Court at that time was the fact that the Trial Judge had selected the acting foreman of the Grand Jury because of his prior experience in the satisfactory manner in which he had performed that duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.628" offset="965883">Petition to rehear was filed before the District Court which was further considered and overruled and then the appeal of course was taken to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and the action of the Federal District Court at Memphis was reversed and the Sixth Circuit did find that there was a systematic exclusion in the selection of foreman of the Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.352" offset="1068805">Our arguments and contentions on behalf of the State of Tennessee basically are -- that Judge Brown’s finding was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.545" offset="1109556">And that the foreman was selected for reasons other than racial and that the foreman had been selected acting foreman to fill the vacancy of the normal foreman who was unavailable during that term of court and the Trial Judge affidavits of the Trial Judge and the foreman of that grand jury both indicated that it was for prior experience and satisfactory work well done.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.702" offset="1226167">Further at that time it should be noted that the foreman of the Grand Jury did not vote in indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.479" offset="1253334">The indictment can -- the voting of the indictment was by 12 grand jurors who were selected from the general venire list, raised further that the record indicates that the raise of the defendants who're respondents here was unknown to them at that time and that there was no mention or there was no alluding to the race of the respondent defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="428.762" offset="1818415">Frankly I'm not that familiar with Tipton County it's in upper West Tennessee across the Mississippi River from Missouri Land.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.167" offset="1848090">It's probably closer to the St. Louis than it is to Nashville.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.999" offset="1879333">The other -- I would also add one witness testified before this Grand Jury panel, that witness was the arresting officer, after that a boat was taken without -- although there were some 20 other witnesses subpoenaed before the Grand Jury at that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.296" offset="1956551">At the trial, there were some five eyewitnesses as to both defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.590" offset="1981733">We contend that the Trial Court was correct in finding that it was based on pragmatic reasons and neutralized or was neutral to the race issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.814" offset="2034604">Second argument that we put forth is that even assuming that error existed and there was systematic exclusion in the selection of the foreman of the Grand Jury, that it would be harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt when the record is viewed on the whole with the evidence of guilt being overwhelming at trial, free of reversible constitutional error and free of any constitutional error as to the petit jury makeup or to the Grand Jury makeup as to the -- who were selected from the general venire list.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.408" offset="2212968">The third argument in position which the state puts forth is that the Federal habeas corpus should be limited when the -- when we have an issue involving the selection of the foreman of a Grand Juror who is one of 13 with 12 voting members and an opportunity has been had for a full and fair litigation in the state system which Tennessee has a three tired court system from the trial, actual trial before the jury of a criminal offense and further an extensive Post Conviction Relief Act, that further that if the trial is free from constitutional reversible error and no assignments are made to the petit jury or to the petit jury -- in essence an extension of the Stone, the Stone versus Powell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.661" offset="2478059">We say this knowing that this is the first time to our knowledge -- to my knowledge that squarely there's been any extension of the rationale in Neil from 1881 to extend to the foreman selection of a grand jury.</text>
