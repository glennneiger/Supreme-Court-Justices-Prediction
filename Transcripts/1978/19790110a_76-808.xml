            <text syncTime="74.508" offset="403477">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.211" offset="414239">The principal question presented on this appeal is whether the Equal Protection Clause requires New York to stop qualifying permanent public school teachers in terms of citizenship or application for citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.075" offset="469723">This New York requirement is statutory.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.431" offset="479128">It is codified in Education Law Section 3001 (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="97.541" offset="495532">It operates only with respect to elementary and public school teachers and it asked for applications for citizenship only from immigrant aliens who have the legal capacity to accept or reject the request.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.734" offset="544329">Other provisions of what appellants believed is a Finally Home State Program permit aliens to receive temporary certificates in certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.948" offset="581214">For example, if an alien is going to federal disabilities and for that reason cannot acquire citizenship, he can receive a temporary certificate during the duration of those disabilities up for up to five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.595" offset="631787">If, as another example, an alien is an exchange teacher teaching in New York public schools as an example of his own national culture, he also obtains a temporary certificate for up to two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.220" offset="678285">The undisputed facts of this case placed the appellees at the core of the statutory requirement for citizenship or application for citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.621" offset="719872">Mrs. Norwick has been a permanent resident alien in the United States for 14 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.332" offset="738785">Mrs. Dachinger has been a permanent resident alien in the United States for 13 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.981" offset="757384">During the entirety of that period and by force of their legal status, they had the capacity to acquire citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.085" offset="785805">Both of these individuals, both appellees and there is no class action order in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.051" offset="809629">Both appellees sought under state law what are called N through 9 Certificates, the certificates that -- pardon me, N through 6 Certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.563" offset="847663">The certificates that permitted teacher to teach every, each and every grade from nursery through sixth grade and in the circumstances where the classroom teacher is responsible for teaching all of the subject matter within those grades.</text>

            <text syncTime="211.508" offset="951421">Yes, Your Honor with the caveat in the record which I should perhaps call to your attention and that is, in addition to the appropriate citizenship requirements, there are other grounds for obtaining provisional as distinguished from permanent certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.176" offset="1010145">Mrs. Norwick at the outset of the case was denied, not the outset of this case, pardon me.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.713" offset="1032296">The outset of her application to the state authorities was denied even a temporary certificate -- pardon me, a permanent certificate because she had not completed the educational requirements for that certificate namely a Master's Degree, that aspect of the case was cured during its pendency below because she did in fact at the Master's Certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.012" offset="1109514">So she would be qualified under state law except for the failure to comply with Education Law 3001 (3).</text>

            <text syncTime="275.780" offset="1208571">If we have accepted that this is true but if the implication of your question is that in accepting that statement, the offer of proof which is set forth at page 303 of the appendix following was inappropriate then we would dispute that.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.214" offset="1294252">Appellants contend that Section 3001 (3) must be sustained under the Equal Protection Clause regardless of whether the statute is subjected to relax or to strict scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.199" offset="1334168">The statute serves the state's substantial purpose in training citizens for -- pardon me, in training pupils for their responsibilities as citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.150" offset="1366037">It does so by the most effective and least drastic means available.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.529" offset="1383487">It includes those who are willing to accept the responsibilities they must impart, namely, individual participation and democratic decision-making and it excludes only those individuals who have refused to participate and who have by that very choice placed themselves at odds with the instructional purpose that the statute carries out.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.495" offset="1471363">Appellees do not refute the proposition that public education in fact trains pupils for citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.663" offset="1496022">They also do not refute the additional proposition that public education through this training has been a force for social cohesion in the United States, forging as it were, one nation out of the various immigrants who settled this country and who continued to come here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.811" offset="1564672">Indeed, we do not think that appellees could successfully refute that proposition and faces this Court's off repeated statements that the principal purpose if not the overriding purpose of public education is in fact training for citizenship.</text>

            <text syncTime="385.301" offset="1646592">Well, not exactly Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.103" offset="1657877">Appellees point out as an example of inconsistency with the statutory program here involved that in New York City, and in New York City only, aliens have been entitled to vote in so-called community school board elections and to seat as members of those community school boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.624" offset="1739901">There are essentially 32 of those school boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.386" offset="1750977">This entire program was first enacted in 1969 and is an educational experiment which is as we showed in appendix, in exhibit A of our reply brief; again, before the legislature in terms of consideration of the validity or success of the experiment.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.434" offset="1831121">Now, in voting in that kind of an election and on seating on a school board, the alien who votes or seats does nothing inconsistent with this statutory program because 3001 is the overriding or supervening state statute which classifies all elementary and public school teachers in New York State and with respect to which that alien member of the school board can do nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.341" offset="1946791">He does not have the discretion to change or affect the role model example of the teacher in the classroom as member of that board.</text>

            <text syncTime="480.669" offset="2028084">I think in fact the choices constitutionally compelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.883" offset="2040936">The fact that New York views as this Court has viewed, public education as the agency or primary agency through which citizenship is developed does not mean by any stretch of the imagination that private schools do or should serve the same interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.542" offset="2107601">In fact, private schools are acknowledged to be in having opinions of this Court been acknowledged to serve quite different interest largely religious interests and they operate in the context where those interests are become paramount to other interests it serves.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.238" offset="2178341">Indeed, for example in New York City, we have private schools that operate along the lines of national interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="633.444" offset="2639245">It is public education that has been accorded, the principal responsibility of training for citizenship.</text>

            <text syncTime="682.070" offset="2833701">The curriculum requirements, the basic curriculum requirements, the 12 common branches in elementary school and some additional courses and secondary school are generally required under the substantial equivalent formula in both public and private schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="837.954" offset="3457191">The force of my argument here today is largely directed to strict scrutiny because of course if the statute survives that test, it must perforce survive the rational basis test and accordingly, I directed my answers in that vein.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.048" offset="3513616">But equally Your Honor, we have taken the position in our briefs which is by no means is true and that is that the appropriate test is one of reasonable relation and that is because training for citizenship as it has been an expressed as the responsibility of the public schools is an important governmental interest, a proposition which appellees don't dispute or refute, at least successfully as I read their papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.347" offset="3614762">And indeed the relationship between the teacher as the individual who is present in the classroom who is the model and example for the behavior or his students ties him closely and reasonably with the execution of that governmental purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.766" offset="3676515">And on those two statements we think, Your Honor, frankly that the statute not only survives reasonable basis examination but also strict scrutiny examination.</text>

            <text syncTime="918.926" offset="3781110">The question then becomes whether or not or the sole question that remains in the case is whether or not the selection of the positive rather than the negative example as that Section 3001 (3) provides is in fact reasonably or necessary related to the instructional purpose that the statute serves.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.952" offset="3869194">And I think it is important in this context to examine for a moment what the teaching and learning process is about.</text>

            <text syncTime="1419.370" offset="5782925">But with private schools, it will simply require the curriculum content and let the private schools choose the teachers themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="1448.925" offset="5901103">And the state apparently believes that it can fulfill that interest at least in the private schools without also requiring citizenship or declarant status for the private school teachers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1486.404" offset="6051046">I think that entirely apart from the private school point, this statue is also under inclusive because under a regulation issued by appellants, aliens who are barred by a federal statute from becoming citizens or even from filing declarations of intent to become citizens are nevertheless permitted in some circumstances to teach even in the public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.383" offset="6154909">I think the statute is over inclusive because it applies to any alien from any country and prevents that alien from teaching any subject at any grade level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.173" offset="6198063">It therefore applies to aliens such as appellees who are willing to take an oath to support the state and federal constitutions and who have actually taught the principles of democracy in New York's private schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.062" offset="6253652">It applies to aliens such as appellees who are married to United States citizens, who are the parents of United States citizens, who have resided here for well over a decade, and who even received their Graduate Education in New York Public Universities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.111" offset="6317913">The statute applies to aliens from countries whose political traditions and values are indistinguishable if not much the same as our own for example, appellee Norwick was born in Scotland and is a citizen of Great Britain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.751" offset="6372456">Even if we assume that the state does have an interest in preventing for example Russian citizens from teaching Civics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.288" offset="6402550">Must it prevent French citizens from teaching French, or Canadian citizens from teaching Math or Metal Work in order to protect that interest?</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.300" offset="6442569">Finally, despite appellants' erroneous claim that it was only dicta, a reading of Kay versus The Board of Education shows that the New York courts have squarely held that the citizenship requirement "is not limited to elementary and secondary schools and the court therefore holds that Bertrand Russell is not qualified to teach in City College by reason of the provisions of this Section."</text>

            <text syncTime="1846.421" offset="7491124">We contend as the New York courts actually held in (Inaudible) that teachers have only very limited discretionary authority under subject to close supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.344" offset="7538772">But whatever authority teachers have to formulate or execute broad policy, they certainly do not possess as much authority to formulate or execute policy and do not have as much continuing or overall impact on the political socialization of students as do their direct superiors the local community school boards who under New York statute have the authority to hire and fire and select teachers to specify the curriculum, to select textbooks and other instructional materials, and "to generally manage and operate the schools."</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.006" offset="7697492">As appellant conceived the New York legislature has authorized non-declarant aliens to vote for and serve as members of those school boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.554" offset="7731660">And it seems to me that in New York at least, it is frivolous to argue that teachers exercise such broad policy making authority that they come within the political community exception --</text>

            <text syncTime="2164.949" offset="8765168">First the majority of Foley expressly reaffirmed at two points in the opinion, earlier cases requiring close scrutiny when aliens are excluded as in this case from "license to professions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.600" offset="8819816">Second, "the majority also stressed that the office of the policeman is in no sense one of the common occupations of the community.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.245" offset="8854403">But teaching is the third most common occupation in New York State even more common done laborers and is apparently the largest category of public.</text>

            <text syncTime="2202.990" offset="8917410">Well, Your Honor the Court has never elaborated on exactly what it does mean by common occupations but that is certainly an important point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.553" offset="8947608">At least four cases decided by this Court in the last five years have quoted that provision of Truax versus Raich which talk about common occupations and that was relied upon for example in Griffiths involving lawyers and the Court apparently thought that lawyers were a common occupation even though they are not as numerous as teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.187" offset="9026184">Third, appellants do not dispute the New York Case Law and the opinions of the New York Attorney General which expressly hold that teaching is not a public office and that teachers are employees not officers and do not "exercise any sovereign power.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.639" offset="9095983">In that connection, I think it's worth noting that the states brief in Foley stressed that state police were designated public officers not employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.953" offset="9137256">Fourth, the majority in Foley also stressed that "most states expressly confine the employment of police officers to citizens.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.795" offset="9176649">But even a generous reading of exhibit C to the states reply brief shows that over three-fourths of the states do not require citizenship or even declarant status to teach in public schools in those states.</text>
