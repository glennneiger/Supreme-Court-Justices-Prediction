            <label>Mr. Paul J. Bargiel</label>
            <text syncTime="49.255" offset="300387">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.279" offset="320449">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.447" offset="333197">This case began in January of 1974 when the plaintiff's father complained against the Department of Children and Family Services of the State of Illinois in the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.447" offset="381158">The complaint challenged the Illinois policy refusing foster care payments, the persons who cared for children who were related to them and to the children themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.052" offset="419610">Illinois based its policy of refusing foster care payments to relatives upon its determination first that assistance had always been provided to related person and to children under the basic AFDC program contained in Section 406 to the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.789" offset="494529">And secondly, upon the determination that Section 408 of the Social Security Act define those eligible for Foster Care benefits as caretakers and children who are unrelated to each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.280" offset="540505">The plaintiffs in this case are caretakers and children who are related to each other and thus are denied Foster Care benefits under Illinois' policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.442" offset="577181">Their complaint alleged the course of action that the Illinois scheme was in violation of their Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.562" offset="605602">The Department of Children and Family Services filed a motion to strike and dismiss the plaintiff's complaint which the three-judge court which was in panel to hear this case treated as a motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.352" offset="652831">The three-judge court held that the Illinois policy of denying Foster Care benefits to children who are related to their caretakers was not a denial of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.652" offset="694000">That case was appealed directly to this Court and the plaintiff in their jurisdictional statement urged in addition to their equal protection claim for the very first time that the Illinois policy or scheme of denying Foster Care benefits was inconsistent with the Federal Social Security Act and therefore there was a violation of the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.317" offset="792639">Because this claim had not previously been presented to the three-judge court, this Court reversed the three-judge court's decision and remanded the case to the three-judge court for consideration of this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.688" offset="838092">On remand, the single judge of the District Court found that the Illinois scheme of the denying Foster Care benefits to related caretakers was inconsistent with the Social Security Act and therefore a violation of the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.293" offset="888560">The Department of Children and Family Services appealed this decision to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.988" offset="927326">The Department of Children and Family Services then filed its notice of appeal to this Court and subsequently its jurisdictional statement urging that its policy of the denying Foster Care benefits to related persons was consistent with the Social Security Act and this Court noted probable jurisdiction on the 21st of February 1978.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="226.012" offset="1007470">Mr. Attorney General, are there many other States had follow Illinois' lead here?</text>

          <turn speaker="paul_j_bargiel" startTime="231.695" stopTime="525.697">
            <label>Mr. Paul J. Bargiel</label>
            <text syncTime="231.695" offset="1030144">There are other states which follow Illinois' lead.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.030" offset="1047489">I believe that the briefs indicate that there are six or seven states who are doing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.575" offset="1077687">I believe, however, that the majority of states who are involve in the program now take the contrary position that is that foster care is maybe related care.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.406" offset="1132962">The issue in this case I think maybe simply stated as our children who are related to their caretakers and children themselves eligible for foster care assistance under Section 408 of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.066" offset="1183640">It is our position that this case involves essentially a question of statutory construction and it's also our position that Section 408 of the Social Security Act by its clear terms indicates that foster care means unrelated care.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.575" offset="1253648">Since our case turns entirely upon a proper reading of the statute, I would like to devote the reminder of my time to a reading of the statute to show the Court what we believed to be the clear indication in the statute itself that foster care is unrelated care.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.868" offset="1334836">The statute is contained in an appendix, our jurisdictional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.534" offset="1349465">This appendix say in Section 608 is contained at page a6 of that appendix and that is what I want to devote my argument to if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.534" offset="1417488">Section 608 is entitled "Payment to States for foster home care of dependent children; definitions".</text>
            <text syncTime="335.354" offset="1444760">On paragraph (a) terms or defines I should say the term dependent child.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.121" offset="1471822">It reads as follows, “The term dependent child' shall, notwithstanding Section 606(a) of this title, also include a child.”</text>
            <text syncTime="350.588" offset="1505677">Now, I would like to focus if I may on two words in one of the phrases that are used in those first two lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.887" offset="1546951">The first word is the word notwithstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.905" offset="1558967">Notwithstanding according to its common usage means in spite of.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.151" offset="1575999">So, the term dependent child in Section 608 is going to be a child who in spite of Section 606(b) of this title.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.408" offset="1609017">Now, Section 606 -- I'm sorry section -- in spite of Section 606(a) of this title.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.768" offset="1630438">Now, Section 606(a) is the regular AFDC program and it provides that the children will be eligible for assistance if they live with specified relative.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.061" offset="1671607">Now, if Section 608 which defines the term dependent child as one that is a child in spite of the definition contained in Section 606(a), it must indicate an intention on the part of Congress to create a class which is different in the class which was already created in Section 606.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.429" offset="1741093">We read that of course since the child who was eligible in 606 was a child who was living with specified relative, we read that as being, the Section 608 child as being someone who is not living with a specified relative.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.908" offset="1810996">Congress also chose the word, chose to include the word also that is after the term dependent child shall notwithstanding Section 606(a) of this title.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.279" offset="1848508">I said it shall also include a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.728" offset="1858330">Now, the word "also" as it's commonly used means in addition to, besides or as well as.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.075" offset="1883721">So, the definition in 608 of dependent child is a definition in addition to or besides or as well as the definition on Section 606(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="454.028" offset="1919457">Again, since the definition in 606(a) requires a dependent child to be living with the specified relative, the definition in Section 608 must be something different, and we contend again that's further indication that the differences that the child is going to be unrelated to his caretaker in Section 608.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.926" offset="1991032">Paragraph one indicates that the term dependent child shall notwithstanding Section 608(a) of this title also include to child and one reads, “who would meet the requirements of such Section 606(a) except for his removal from the home of relative specified in Section 606(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="491.418" offset="2069086">So under paragraph (a)1, a dependent trial is a child who notwithstanding the provisions of Section 606, shall include also a child who would be eligible under Section 606 but for his removal from the home of a specified relative.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.894" offset="2130944">We submit that this is again an indication of the fact that Congress intended to create a new class of persons here on the Section 608, and that new class of persons were going to be eligible for care are persons who are unrelated to the persons for whom, or by whom they are given care.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="525.697" offset="2206177">Now, that you're -- you are saying that the language except for his removal from a home by judicial decree suggests that 606(a) would exclude those people and in such a way (Voice Overlap).</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul J. Bargiel</label>
            <text syncTime="540.362" offset="2264795">That's -- that is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.440" offset="2277125">That is precisely our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.919" offset="2287052">One of the reasons so we take that position is that the children who were removed from the home of a relative pursuant to a judicial determination that that home was no longer fit where all this children who are eligible for assistance under the basic AFDC program contained in Section 606.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.027" offset="2351522">Congress did not need to pass Section 608 in order to provide illegibility for children who were removed from the home of one relative pursuant to a judicial determination and placed in the home of another relative.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.758" offset="2398438">Those kinds of children were always covered under the basic AFDC program.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.393" offset="2416933">It's our position then since Congress didn't need to do that, it must have been their intention to create new class of persons who would be eligible for assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.722" offset="2446294">That new class of persons of course are persons who are unrelated to their caretakers because they were never eligible for assistance under the basic AFDC program.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.423" offset="2485060">And I -- and I might add Congress too through out the definition of dependent child here has contrasted the definition of dependent child in Section 608 with the definition of dependent child in Section 606 and I think that contrast was intended to demonstrate that the class of children who are going to be eligible for assistance under Section 608 is a different class than the one on the Section 606.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.962" offset="2579205">Now, on page a7 on the brief at paragraph (b), the Congress has also defined the term aid the families with dependent children.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.753" offset="2618389">And they do that in the same fashion that they have defined the term dependent child on paragraph (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="634.496" offset="2641377">They say the term make the families with dependent children shall notwithstanding Section 606(b) of this title include also, foster care on behalf of a child described in paragraph (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="645.478" offset="2685262">The term Aid to Families with Dependent Children in Section 606(b) which is the basic AFDC program means, aid to a family who is taking care of a child who is related to that family.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.323" offset="2748688">If this section notwithstand -- if Section 606 which is the new program, the Foster Care program is created notwithstanding Section 606(b), again, it must be another indication that Congress intended to create a new class of persons and again that new class of persons are families who are not related to the children that they live with.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.677" offset="2822040">Now, I think too that the plaintiffs recognized in this case, that that language notwithstanding Section 606(a) or notwithstanding Section 606(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="690.869" offset="2866866">In the term also, presents a problem to their interpretation of the statute and I would say that because they define Section 608(b) that is -- they defined the term Aid to Families with the Dependent Children at page 35 of their brief and I think it's interesting to note the way they do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.534" offset="2945546">Page 35 at the bottom of their appellee's brief quotes, from Congress' statute Section 608(b) they say it's given a specific meaning and the meaning that they give it read as follows, they say, “The term Aid to Families with Dependent Children shall include foster care in behalf of a child describe in paragraph (a) of this section.”</text>
            <text syncTime="733.522" offset="3037497">What's significant about that is that they have deleted the very language which I say indicates Congress' intention to create a new class of children.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.292" offset="3072502">It reads the term Aid to Families with Dependent Children shall and then the phrase notwithstanding Section 606(b) is deleted.</text>

            <text syncTime="906.789" offset="3730578">Well, 607 requires that a child lives with a specified relative again, and be deprived of parental support because of his father's unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.885" offset="3758895">That's precisely our point.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.398" offset="3764955">Under those programs, a child would be eligible for assistance if he had the ability to live with a specified relative.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.125" offset="3799855">But children who could not leave with the relative, were not eligible for any assistance at all and when the Congress passed this program it's our position that they did it with the intension of benefiting a class of children who were previously ineligible for any kind of assistance at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.071" offset="3855653">As the Solicitor General points on in his brief too, I might add, there was no controversy in this case until the monitory benefits for foster care where increased beyond what the basic the AFDC program provided for.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.376" offset="3904867">But when this program was initially enacted in 1961, that is the Foster Care program, when in was initially acted -- enacted in 1961, the benefits as I understand were precisely the same for the basic program as they were for the Foster Care program.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.711" offset="3962232">Now, it seems to me if the benefits were the same, when the program was created and they weren't increased until 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.448" offset="3989191">If the benefits were the same that must indicate that Congress intended at that time to benefit a new class of persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.508" offset="4017403">One who had been previously without any kind of assistance at all, because the benefits were precisely the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.352" offset="4056795">At any rate, my point is that the way that the plaintiffs can wind up being eligible for assistance under this program is to exclude the language which I said as they have done at page 35 of their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.316" offset="4108622">In order to be eligible for foster care or in order for the state to be able to receive matching benefits for foster care, they have to under Section 608(f), they have to provide a program which is designed to improve the conditions in the home from which the child was removed or to otherwise make possible, as being place on a home of a relative specified in Section 606(a) of this title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.693" offset="4206111">It's our position that if the state has to provide a program which will put a child, take a child out of foster care and put him in the home of a specified relative that has no significance or no meaning if the child was already in the home of a relative because the goal of Section 608 is then satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.839" offset="4286777">That is -- that is to say, that a child -- there is no purpose or point in taking a child out of the home of one relative and putting him in the home of another relative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.032" offset="4331499">This -- this language of Congress in Section 608(f) in our view has no significance whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.313" offset="4356577">If the statute is interpreted to permit foster care by relatives, it has no meaning.</text>

            <text syncTime="1152.813" offset="4714663">In order for the plaintiffs to include themselves in this category, to make themselves eligible, they have to engage in a selective reading of the statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1196.502" offset="4889370">This case presents the question of whether a neglected or abused child judicially taken from his own home may be deprived to federal Foster Care benefits solely because the state then places him in a home of his relative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.610" offset="4953840">The Department of Health Education and Welfare with the children here says that Congress intended no such deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.403" offset="4981008">Illinois says, “The Congress intended precisely that deprivation by affirming the Court of Appeals' decision here, this Court will effectuate Congress' intent, these neglected or abused children be cared for under the Federal Foster Care program which was intended to assure this children the most suitable out of home care for them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.954" offset="5067212">Now, the state defendant says the benefits here are the same and tries to make the program served -- duplicate assistant programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.577" offset="5109635">Programs did not provide duplicate assistance today and they did not provide it in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.721" offset="5130219">Section 408 provides in Section F and in the service components of the licensing standards a range of social services which is specifically designed to meet the needs of neglected or abused children who have been removed from their own homes and made state wards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.919" offset="5203048">These services are provided to assure the child proper care and the foster family home or child care institution in which he is placed and also are provided to the child and to the parents from which -- from whom he was taken in order to affect the reunification of the family.</text>

            <text syncTime="1307.237" offset="5332302">The character of those services applies to a class of children who have been abused or neglected in their own homes not just to abused and neglected children who have been placed in the homes of non-relatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.207" offset="5380159">The services provide, the required services under the Federal Act require an individualized social service plan to assure the child proper care in the home in which she is placed and also provide for services to not only him but to the parents, the home from which she was removed in order to effectuate a reunification of the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.278" offset="5468453">The character of those services is no less applicable to children who are placed with relatives and those who are placed with non-relatives.</text>

            <text syncTime="1361.452" offset="5549223">So no, the service component here which is not only reflected in F but also reflected in the licensing or approval standards is responsive to the abuse or neglect and that's not -- it doesn't go along to children who are placed in non-related homes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1504.949" offset="6123186">From Section 608, oh, yes, except that I think as the defendants takes time to point out that the statutory definition does have to be interpreted in the context of its statutory environment particularly Section 601, Section 42 U.S.C., Section 601 which provides that the primary purpose of the program, one of the primary purposes of all the AFDC programs is to encourage the care of dependent children in their own homes or in the homes of relatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.001" offset="6243349">Thus, our rights straight forward we do have to turn on Section 608 but it has to be interpreted in the light of Section 401 and it's the state's policy here which frustrates the primary purpose of all the AFDC programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.211" offset="6304266">What's happening here is you have Congress in 1956 amending the Social Security Act since they specifically the one on the primary purposes of all the AFDC programs is to encourage the care of dependent children in their own homes or in the homes of relatives and the import of the states' position is that five years later Congress has established a new AFDC program which frustrates precisely those goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.471" offset="6397262">And it frustrates it in precisely this way as this -- that the state's policy serves as a disincentive in the first instance for relatives to care dependent children has happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.647" offset="6449925">It has happened in this case, the Youakims were discouraged from taking care of children who are related to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.366" offset="6480854">That's the first way that discourages as the primary purpose of the AFDC programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.420" offset="6501021">The second way is that even if that disincentive is overcome and the children are as they were here placed in the homes of relatives then the State policy denies them to service specified in Section 608(f) designed precisely to reunify the family as its placed back in his own home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.342" offset="6584717">It is most unreasonable to read Section 6 -- Section 408 of the Act to frustrate what Congress five years previously had said with the primary purposes of all the AFDC programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.734" offset="6646262">So, it was not true in 1961 and it's not true today that the programs provide duplicate assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.962" offset="6679176">Although as defendant points out, there was no higher federal matching rate in 1961 for these benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.770" offset="6710418">In fact, all the states immediately even though there was no higher federal matching rate, immediately began paying substantially higher benefits and this reflects the recognition by the states that what was meant here was a program to care for children who needed special remedial care, who needed more benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.394" offset="6784920">Now in 1967, when the matching rate was increased, what Congress said in providing those increased matching benefits was that the benefits were necessary because foster care was more costly than care in a child's home and also that it was responsive to the needs of the child and that's what's going on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.059" offset="6875617">Congress established a new program to meet the needs of these children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.514" offset="6893380">These children who have been especially grown up in unsuitable environments and have been subject to abuse or neglect, it's a remedial program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.155" offset="6932041">This is not simply a program for children who don't happen to have a relative to live with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.568" offset="6953671">In fact, which is what defendant is arguing would suggest in fact of course most children who don't have relatives to live with aren't eligible for the Foster Care program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.299" offset="6992541">This was not a new comprehensive program to take care of children who didn't happen to have a relative to live with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.137" offset="7023888">What it was is a new program to take care of children who have been subject to abuse or neglect in their own homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.012" offset="7055444">And it's a small program especially designed to meet the needs of children unfortunate enough to have grown up in those sorts of environments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.928" offset="7091075">In Illinois, for instance, there are over 500,000 children eligible for regular AFDC benefits but the entire AFDC Foster Care program includes only 4,000 children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.150" offset="7127960">So, we're talking about a small group of children here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.533" offset="7149484">Now, defendants placed great reliance on the statute and we think they are proper to place great reliance on the statute but they draw the wrong conclusions for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.096" offset="7203715">The statute very persuasively as the Solicitor points out supports the conclusion that the children here are eligible for Foster Care benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.473" offset="7245302">We discussed the statute at length in our brief but there are four points that merit emphasis here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.497" offset="7265364">First is the statutory definition of foster family home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.623" offset="7281873">Second is the specification that AFDC shall include foster care to an eligible child in the foster family home of any individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.659" offset="7318026">Third is the provision within the statutory definition that foster family homes in which eligible children are placed may be approved as meeting licensing standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.144" offset="7355956">This is a provision which is specifically applicable to homes, to states in which relative homes are not licensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.288" offset="7388557">And fourth, in Section 402(a)(19)(f), a related provision of the Act which constitutes a specific congressional recognition of a relative home as a foster family home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.378" offset="7436936">First, the statutory definition of foster family home, defendant dismisses the significance of this because of the statutory definitions repetition of the defined term foster family home in the definition itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.037" offset="7507571">I'm reading now from the last paragraph of Section 408.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.624" offset="7541844">In fact, the repetition of the terms suggest a congressional weariness that any paraphrase of that term might be read to restrict the states' authority to place a child in the home which it might deemed most suitable and thus that the only restrictions on foster family homes are those the state places on the home itself in terms of the homes' suitability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.043" offset="7631496">But that aside, Mr. Justice White, you look a bit confused, I'm sorry okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.250" offset="7672351">I'm sorry, I thought you'd ask a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.507" offset="7685413">But the use of the defined term foster family home has no reason to stop reading the definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.723" offset="7714252">The definition goes on to say that a foster family must at least be a home for children and it must be licensed or approved by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.837" offset="7746748">The purpose of the licensing or approval requirement was to assure that the homes in which eligible children were placed met state qualitative standards and it's state standards which must govern their suitability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.526" offset="7797426">In Illinois as in all states, caretakers of state foster children and their homes are required to and do meet the same qualitative standards as applied to homes caring for non-relative foster children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.634" offset="7849880">And these qualitative standards which I've reviewed summarily before mandate that the home meet specified safety and health standards and prescribe minimum safety requirements and the caretakers themselves must meet certain -- must pass inspection as to their health and their overall fitness to care for these children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.538" offset="7929501">In short, except for purposes of AFDC foster care eligibility, Illinois deems the related caretakers here to be foster parents just in the same manners as it does to unrelated caretakers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.328" offset="7976730">Defendants continued cate -- grouped the related caretakers here with the relatives under the regular AFDC program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.233" offset="8008286">But in fact, the relatives here and the homes here just aren't any relatives and they aren't any homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.083" offset="8035662">These are relatives and homes which have been especially approved by the state under state law to be suitable for the care of children who have been abused and neglected in their own homes and then taken from those homes and made state wards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.101" offset="8099819">So, the grouping that defendants try to effectuate is belied by its own law and its own practice and policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.643" offset="8141928">Mr. Chief Justice Burger, in this context, in the context of this statutory definition of foster family home which is the determinative term in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.835" offset="8198666">In that context, the state's argument really rests upon a proposition that Congress meant to simply exclude them, exclude relative homes from the meaning of foster family homes in the first instance but as in response to Mr. Chief Justice Burger's question, counsel concede that that, in fact, the ordinary use of the word may often carry with it and usually does carry with it as we discussed at length in our brief the meaning of relative care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.556" offset="8329592">As a matter of fact, in this Court's previous opinion in this case, it used the term related foster care and related foster parents, related foster home without any apparent ease or strain associated with that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.550" offset="8381524">That's the common ordinary meaning of the term and that's the meaning which Congress attributed to it in the foster care statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.190" offset="8420080">Second point in the statute which I emphasize is Section 408(b) which refers to the AFDC, term AFDC shall notwithstanding Section 606(b) of this title include also foster care in behalf of the child described in the foster family home of any individual and the term of any individual explicates the term foster family home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.742" offset="8534392">It demonstrates what's otherwise clear from the legislative history and from the logic of the statute, that Congress meant to include any individual the state might deem to be a suitable caretaker for its foster children as AFDC foster parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.222" offset="8596250">What individuals might be AFDC foster parents, Section 408(b) when read with the statutory definition says that any individuals may be so long as the state deems them suitable under its licensing standards which Illinois does for relatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.312" offset="8684648">Finally, there is the -- or third there is the approval provision in Section 4 -- in the last paragraph of Section 408 which provides that a foster family home maybe either licensed or approved as meeting licensing standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.498" offset="8741386">Legislative history does not indicate specifically why this approval of procedure was included -- alternate approval procedure was included in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.127" offset="8771897">But we do know that in 1961, as today, several states exclude relative homes from licensing in the first instance and in that light, it's most logical to read that insertion of the approval procedure as Congress' effort, Congress' mandate that children placed in such homes, that those homes meet the same standards as were applied to homes which were licensed under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.750" offset="8906376">In this context, the approval requirement emergence with Congress' means of insuring that the children placed in those homes, in their relative homes would receive the same benefit as children placed in homes which weren't licensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.109" offset="8955800">But there obviously would have been no reason for Congress to include that alternative provision unless it intended that children place in relative homes would be eligible for the Foster Care program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.409" offset="8996968">Fourth point in the statute, which I have emphasized, we do discuss others in our brief but the four points in this statute would emphasize this Section 402(a)(19)(f) which we discussed at length in our brief and I wont review that in detail here but that does constitute a specific congressional recognition of a relative home as a foster family home.</text>

            <text syncTime="2251.760" offset="9110444">The institution was run by the grandmother of the child, what would that enter into?</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.053" offset="9151613">As distinguished from a private home of the grandmother, it's an institution where they got 40 or 50 children or a 150 that happens to be run by the grandmother of the particular child.</text>

            <text syncTime="2272.263" offset="9192469">Well, the state is given authority under its licensing standards to approve certain classifications of individuals as suitable caretakers or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.646" offset="9233951">A state might well decide and precisely right Mr. Chief Justice Burger, it's precisely not the question presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.323" offset="9260701">A state might decide that for purposes of institutional care, it might not be appropriate to have a grandmother or any relative care for that child in that setting because she might show favoritism, maybe against the child or maybe for the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.287" offset="9320469">The question is not presented in this case about whether a state might deem relatives to be not suitable caretakers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.101" offset="9351816">Illinois does deem relatives to be suitable caretakers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.197" offset="9372191">Hope that has answered the question but Section 402(a)(19)(f) which we discussed at length in our brief, you first specifically to continuing either protective payments or foster care payments to a child in the home, in a home of a relative who refuses to cooperate in the win program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.018" offset="9451395">It didn't mean to suggest in the brief that the state might not make other alternative dispositions with respect to a child in a home of a non-cooperating relative but that provision does limit the states' remedial action to a dependent child to either continuing foster care in a home of relative or it's going to continue AFDC outside the home to a -- limiting it to foster care which must mean that it must be continued in any home in which the child is placed and that does constitute a specific congressional recognition of a relative home as a foster family home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.997" offset="9607398">Finally, HEW's administrative interpretation of the statute unequivocally supports the conclusion that the children here are eligible for federal Foster Care benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.510" offset="9649403">We have not emphasized it here because it emphasizes itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.481" offset="9669256">It is the interpretation by an agency which is charged with enforcing the foster care statute and indeed was at least cooperated in proposing and establishing the Foster Care program in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.655" offset="9729964">Moreover, this interpretation has been a matter of public record and prominently so for over four years --</text>

            <text syncTime="2418.290" offset="9776567">Fourteen years and I think the reason why there was a lapse, why there was not an articulated policy prior to ‘74 though the Solicitor notes the operative policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.775" offset="9826513">It was in fact in effect prior to ‘74.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.051" offset="9835604">The reason why it is, it supports, again, the conclusion that the children here are eligible it's precisely because the fact of whether children were placed in relative homes or non-relative homes is really irrelevant to the Foster Care program in the sense that the states are given, the placement authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.452" offset="9921181">Congress in the foster care statute delegated the states the right to make that placement which it deemed to be in the best interest of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.914" offset="9967052">So, the Federal Government wasn't reviewing these individual placement decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.238" offset="9980322">This is not like the ordinary situations where it sometimes comes up in AFDC cases wherein the state plan one must specify that you're not providing benefits to children, let's say, between 18 and 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.699" offset="10026193">There was no necessity or need for the states to make that specification, so there would have been no HEW review to those kinds of decisions and it only came to light I think when following two District Court decisions, Federal District Court decisions in early 1971 which brought this fact that a few states were not considering children placed in related care to be eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.203" offset="10128175">And at that point, HEW fairly promptly issued an instruction mandating what the proper interpretation of the Act and its own regulations was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.395" offset="10184913">In conclusion, Section 408 in common sense, common sense in terms of what Congress must have intended in light of the primary purposes of the AFDC program and in light of the traditional suitability of relative care in our society which the state policy here frustrates and deters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.270" offset="10284492">The statute itself, in common sense, point decisively towards that reading of Section 408 making the children here eligible for foster care and decisively against the conclusion, the Congress meant to discourage the care of neglected or abused children by their relatives and deny them the higher benefits and specialized social services which were necessary to remedy the abuse and neglect to which they have been subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.303" offset="10392534">The Department of Health Education and Welfare says that, that reading of the statute making the children here eligible is the correct reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.022" offset="10423463">It is the correct reading and it is for that reason that the Court of Appeals decision should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2596.399" offset="10488978">I would simply like to reaffirm that our position that unrelated persons are not eligible for foster care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.914" offset="10519071">It is based upon the plain meaning of the language employed by Congress in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.405" offset="10537044">Eligibility is defined in terms of a dependent child or families with dependent children, not in terms of foster care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.782" offset="10562539">Foster care is the thing that a dependent child or an eligible family or eligible for and that's the thing that the plaintiffs overlooked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.235" offset="10592319">I would like to point out one, if I may, one thing that the plaintiff's reading of this statute could result in which Congress obviously never intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.654" offset="10641951">Section 606 which provides a specification of certain relatives includes as a relative specified relative, a mother or a father, that is a child can be living with his mother or father or certain other relative and be eligible for basic AFDC assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.170" offset="10704018">If a brother or a sister can be a foster parent under Section 408 then there is no reason that a mother or a father cannot be a foster parent if they otherwise meet the eligibility criteria because they are also one of the specified relatives contained in Section 606 which Section 608 is written notwithstanding or in spite of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.296" offset="10800567">So, I would suggest to the Court that the plaintiff's construction of this statute would result in at least that foolish result and I would again respectfully request that the Court reverse the determination of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
