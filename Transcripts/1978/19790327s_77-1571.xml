            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="8.821" offset="35213">This comes here on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.199" offset="60709">The facts were simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.465" offset="69799">A Delaware policeman and a policeman cruiser stopped the car in which the respondent Prouse was riding.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.700" offset="106789">At the time of the stop, the officer had no suspicion and no probable or reasonable cause to believe that the car was being operated contrary to any traffic or safety law or that any occupant of the car had violated any law or was subject to detention or to interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.528" offset="210024">It is undisputed that the stop was a purely random stop to check the license of the driver and the registration of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.002" offset="247954">As it turned out however, there were incriminating materials in plain sight in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.202" offset="276793">The office seized the materials and Prouse was convicted based on this evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.719" offset="310857">The Supreme Court of Delaware set aside the conviction on the grounds that the stop of the car without probable cause or reasonable suspicion to believe that some crime was being committed violated the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and that the evidence which was a product of that illegal stop was less than admissible in evidence with the purpose of convicting Brother Prouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.497" offset="433946">The conviction was set aside and the State of Delaware challenges that holding in this Court, but for the reasons which we state in opinion, we have filed today, we agreed with the Delaware Supreme Court that this stop violated the Fourth Amendment and we consequently affirmed this judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.706" offset="538749">Mr. Justice Blackmun joined by Mr. Justice Powell has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.546" offset="558184">Mr. Justice Rehnquist has dissented.</text>
