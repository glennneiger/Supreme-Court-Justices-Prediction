            <text syncTime="52.530" offset="313448">This is a suit filed by the petitioner in the bankruptcy court seeking a determination that a debt owed him the respondent and evidenced by a Decree Bankruptcy State Court Judgment was not dischargeable base upon Section 17a (2) and 17a (4) of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.240" offset="404355">The bankruptcy court grant summary judgment for the respondent determining the debt to be dischargeable and that order was affirmed by the District Court for the District of Colorado and by the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.265" offset="456391">This Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.483" offset="469347">The facts upon which that summary judgment was entered are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.127" offset="487842">In June 1975, Jefferson Bank and Trust Company began an action against the respondent, Mr. Felsen, his company, Le Mans Motors and the petitioner, Garvin Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.896" offset="546983">The bank's claim against the respondent was premised upon a promissory note he had executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.429" offset="569135">The bank's claim against Mr. Brown, the petitioner, was premised upon a guarantee of that note he had executed in favor of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.617" offset="605811">Mr. Brown filed a cross-claim against Mr. Felsen based upon indemnity.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.716" offset="630262">No claims of fraud were pled in the state court action by Mr. Brown against the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.900" offset="658996">Shortly after the respondent's deposition, the parties all stipulated to judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.051" offset="679581">Mr. Brown stipulated the entry of judgment in favor of the bank and against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.631" offset="697866">The respondent stipulated to the entry of judgment in a like amount in favor of Mr. Brown and against the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.209" offset="732244">The state court entered judgment based upon that stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.764" offset="746454">No evidentiary record was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.034" offset="759515">Thereafter, the respondent filed his petition in bankruptcy and Mr. Brown commenced an adversary proceeding to have it determined that the debt owed him by the respondent was not dischargeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.795" offset="810506">Mr. Felsen moved for summary judgment contending that despite the obligation of the bankruptcy court to determine dischargeability since no fraud had been pled in the state court action, the bankruptcy court could not go beyond that record.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.042" offset="871528">It been res judicata and the debt would have to be termed dischargeable in the absence of that fraud finding.</text>

            <text syncTime="521.539" offset="2189563">Now presumably, the creditor may go to the state courts before the bankruptcy proceeding and seek a judgment necessarily in under the Tenth Circuit Rule that will include findings of fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="633.415" offset="2636988">It seems to me that creditors ought not to be encouraged to go into the state courts prior to a bankruptcy seeking default judgment base upon fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="871.717" offset="3590248">On behalf of the respondent, we suggest that the Tenth Circuit decision is supported both by good law and by common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.867" offset="3638836">The counsel suggests that the determination of dischargeability in the bankruptcy court is exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.987" offset="3687320">I don't find the word exclusive in the statute that has been cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.925" offset="3707068">It's simply says that the bankruptcy court shall determine dischargeability and we don't quarrel with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.098" offset="3735803">And that is in the 1970 Amendment to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.811" offset="3754611">But when petitioner says that there is a distinct difference between proving fraud in a state court and proving fraud in the bankruptcy court are disagree with the petition the definition of fraud under Colorado law which we've cited in Morrison versus Goodspeed element four on intent is the same as fraud in the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.133" offset="3863907">And to say that the Colorado law on fraud is substantially different from the state law isn't the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.812" offset="3890657">It's the distinction without any real difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="2494.256" offset="10080423">But I would argue that the better rule is to allow the parties to be bound by the facts and to allow the bankruptcy court to make this separate legal determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.742" offset="10118353">Otherwise you force the creditors in every single case to plead and prove or otherwise dispose of fraud just to preserve a federal right for those few cases in which bankruptcy actually happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.354" offset="10172792">And for that reason, I'd ask that this Court vacate the Tenth Circuit judgment and allow the petitioner to proceed.</text>
