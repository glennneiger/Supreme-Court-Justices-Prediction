            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We will hear arguments first this morning in 1163 on the consolidated cases Friedman and others against Rogers and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.092" offset="151698">Mr. Niemann, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Larry Niemann</label>
            <text syncTime="26.820" offset="210631">Mr. Chief Justice, and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.966" offset="223274">This case involves the constitutionality of two provisions of the Texas Optometry Act; one dealing with the statutory requirements for a Board membership, the other dealing with statutory prohibitions of the practice of optometry under an assumed name.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.171" offset="288057">I as Attorney for the Texas Optometric Association will be presenting the facts relevant to the Board membership statute and arguing that, that statute is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.105" offset="331839">Ms. Dorothy Prengler, who is an Assistant Attorney General for the State representing the Board, will be presenting the facts concerning the assumed name statute and she will be arguing that, that statute is also constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.892" offset="382934">Now,if I may briefly present the procedural posture of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.287" offset="400488">The first statute as I mentioned, which is an issue is the Board membership statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.024" offset="419506">It requires that four of the six members of the Texas Optometry Board shall be members of the Texas Optometric Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.791" offset="454510">The second statute is the assumed name statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.730" offset="470288">It provides that optometrists in Texas shall practice optometry under their own personal names and may not practice optometry under assumed names or trade names.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.298" offset="516577">The lawsuit was originally filed by Dr. Rogers, who was one the six members of the State Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.230" offset="540296">He challenged the Board membership statute, as an arbitrary classification in violation of his equal protection rights, his due process rights, and most recently his associational rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.744" offset="590346">He also challenged the assumed name statute as a violation of his rights of commercial free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.400" offset="616991">The lower court, which was a three judge court, held that the assumed name statute was unconstitutional and was in violation of commercial free speech, concluding that their decision was mandated by this Court’s opinion in Bates.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="142.512" stopTime="149.031">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="142.512" offset="673416">What do the Texas Statute is provide about group practice of Medicine, the general practice of Medicine?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="larry_niemann" startTime="149.031" stopTime="209.478">
            <label>Mr. Larry Niemann</label>
            <text syncTime="149.031" offset="699538">Your Honor, the Texas Statutes are silent regarding the group practice of medicine.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.451" offset="721168">I would point out that it's very important that there has been no history of abuse, and there is distinction between the group practice of Medicine and the assumed name practice of optometry and I will expand on that later in my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.742" offset="774353">At the same time, the Court held that the assumed name statute was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.167" offset="796087">The Court upheld the Board membership statute, reasoning that it was an Economic Regulation Law that the rational relationship test applied and that the State Legislature did have ample reason, ample justification for the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.565" offset="857631">The Court listed three specific rationales for this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.101" offset="875813">The bottom line of each being that there was a greater likelihood of law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.206" offset="896188">The four of the six members of the optometry Board were from TOA.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.075" offset="919698">Now to the facts which are specifically relevant to the Board membership statute.</text>

          <turn speaker="larry_niemann" startTime="215.597" stopTime="236.348">
            <label>Mr. Larry Niemann</label>
            <text syncTime="215.597" offset="965778">That's correct Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.773" offset="974451">The unique history of optometry in Texas is what the lower court pointed to as the justification for the Board membership statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.349" offset="1012799">That history deals with commercial optometrists, historical track record of hostility toward enforcement of the Texas Optometry Law.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="236.348" stopTime="249.726">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="236.348" offset="1048743">Counsel, Mr. Justice Blackmun I understood asked you kind of an either or question and you said, ‘that's correct'.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.253" offset="1084374">Can a commercial Optometrist join the TOA or can he not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="larry_niemann" startTime="249.726" stopTime="278.909">
            <label>Mr. Larry Niemann</label>
            <text syncTime="249.726" offset="1102242">He cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.919" offset="1115094">It also deals not only with the track record of non-law enforcement by the commercial optometrists, but also a track record prior to the passage of the Act for deception and consumer abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.381" offset="1164936">Now in understanding these facts, it is important for the Court to appreciate that in Texas, there are two separate classifications of optometrists; professional optometrists and commercial optometrists.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.398" offset="1216972">Traditionally --</text>

            <text syncTime="278.909" offset="1218957">In your view, The Texas Law prohibit commercial optometry altogether constitutionally?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="larry_niemann" startTime="284.973" stopTime="330.656">
            <label>Mr. Larry Niemann</label>
            <text syncTime="284.973" offset="1243303">Yes Your Honor, I think they could.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.048" offset="1259604">Traditionally, professional optometrists have been characterized by an economic independence from opticians.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.349" offset="1292727">They have been characterized by their practice by appointment rather than a waiting line method.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.571" offset="1313625">They have emphasized quality and longer and more thorough examinations of the patients and a close doctor patient relationship, but most importantly professional optometrists have been characterized by a long history of strong law enforcement of the Texas Optometry Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.215" offset="1388231">And as I indicated earlier, professional optometrists or rather the Texas optometric Association is composed exclusively of professional optometrists.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.656" offset="1425951">Well, that's kind of secular, isn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="333.385" offset="1436923">They have been interested in enforcing the law, because the law benefits them and probably the law was enacted under their support.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="larry_niemann" startTime="344.790" stopTime="353.569">
            <label>Mr. Larry Niemann</label>
            <text syncTime="344.790" offset="1482480">The law was enacted by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.321" offset="1492616">We happen to agree with the legislature and we hold a philosophy of strongly enforcing the mandates of the legislature Your Honor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="353.569" stopTime="355.906">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="353.569" offset="1517693">Because it's to your benefit.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="larry_niemann" startTime="355.906" stopTime="618.986">
            <label>Mr. Larry Niemann</label>
            <text syncTime="355.906" offset="1526993">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.621" offset="1533889">There is no doubt about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.937" offset="1543084">In contrast, all the commercial optometrists and the commercial optometrists have been characterized by high volume, high speed assumed name practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.802" offset="1586552">Traditionally, they have been employed with or associated with the retail optician chain stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.822" offset="1614660">They have been subjected to highly restrictive employment contracts, economic tie-in.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.408" offset="1644962">There is some dispute in the record over that Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.779" offset="1654471">Dr. Roger, says witness is to say that there are lower prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.369" offset="1668890">We have a former commercialist himself, then owner of a chain who had stated that the chain store operations actually under some circumstances cause an increase in prices, and there is a California study that I think is in the record that discounts, the long standing argument that a commercial adverting, assumed name type practice actually reduces prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.900" offset="1779022">As I was saying, the commercial optometrists were characterized historically by these economic tie-ins and controlled by opticians.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.848" offset="1810787">Most importantly, commercial optometrists have been characterized in Texas by repeated history of hostility toward the enforcement of the Texas Optometry Laws on the books.Now</text>
            <text syncTime="439.551" offset="1861569">in the record, the most blatant episode of optometry, commercial optometry's hostility toward law enforcement, is an incident which occurred in 1967, the year immediately preceding the legislature's adoption of the Board membership statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.661" offset="1926040">During that year, the commercial optometrists held the majority of the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.980" offset="1943280">They immediately proceeded to repeal a rule called the professional Responsibility Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.192" offset="1964178">Now that rule contains some very important provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.208" offset="1980165">It prevented fee splitting between optometrists and opticians.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.927" offset="1995107">It prevented tie-ins and kickbacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.730" offset="2006288">It minimized the economic control by opticians over optometrists.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.314" offset="2024678">It required optometrists to use their own personal names and prevented them from using assumed names or names at offices where they did not actually practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.057" offset="2063548">That professional responsibility rule was the corner stone of the public's protection against deception and abuse in optometry, and it had been adopted as a rule by the Board to correct and cure some long standing abuses by commercial optometry.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.663" offset="2130004">Now as soon as the commercialist on the Board attempted to repeal this rule, the legislature reacted very strongly.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.272" offset="2164485">The legislature refused to confirm the appointments of the commercialists that had done the damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.202" offset="2188204">The legislature abolished the old Board, created a new Board and mandated that four of the six members be from TOA.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.696" offset="2218193">And the legislature went even further.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.337" offset="2228746">They withdrew all rule making authority from the Board, they incorporated the professional responsibility rule into the statute and assigned the task of enforcing the statute to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.321" offset="2280678">In effect, what the legislature did was to codify into statutory form, very high standards of professional conduct; standards which coincided with those of TOA.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.950" offset="2335222">The legislature did not want to put enforcement of these very high standards in the hands of the commercial optometrists who were the mortal enemies of those standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.082" offset="2371688">In other words Your Honor, the legislature did not want to put the fox in charge of the hyenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.303" offset="2392586">And that is the historical background of the Board membership statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.175" offset="2412022">Ms. Prengler will as I have stated, present the facts relevant to the assumed name statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.258" offset="2436368">Now to the legal arguments regarding the Board membership statute; I would like to rebut in sequence each of the four separate grounds of the unconstitutionality presented by Dr. Rogers.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.585" offset="2485687">These are arbitrary classification, irrebuttable presumption, procedural due process and associational rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.272" offset="2528423">Turing first to the arbitrary classification argument; Dr. Rogers has argued that the Board membership statute is an arbitrary classification of optometrists which violates his Equal Protection Rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="709.601" offset="2941785">The statute requires that the Board consists of four members of TOA, and I would think conclusively that would require their membership at the time of appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.383" offset="2992880">I would presume that it requires continuing membership, and resignation or ouster from TOA would vacate his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.611" offset="3033840">Now regarding arbitrary classification, Dr. Rogers argues that the statute is arbitrary, because it has no rational basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.748" offset="3070412">We disagree and the lower court disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.081" offset="3083682">The lower court concluded conclusions very similar to the facts I have just recited.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.657" offset="3110013">The court stated that the three rationales where the TOA members are more likely to be economically independent than non-TOA members.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.194" offset="3144182">The TOA members have a greater likelihood of emphasizing the highest quality of eye care as compared to non-TOA members.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.090" offset="3175737">And thirdly, the TOA members are more profound to enforce the Texas Optometry Act than non-TOA members.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.220" offset="3204263">I believe that is fair reading of the opinion that these were findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.612" offset="3221817">It is our position that the bottom line of all these regions is a greater likelihood of enforcement of the Optometry Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.979" offset="3267271">We do submit then that there are rational basis and therefore the arbitrary classification argument follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.069" offset="3303633">Dr. Roger's next theory is that the Board membership statute violates substantive due process because of an irrebuttable presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.464" offset="3341249">He argues that the legislative classification creates or triggers an irrebuttable presumption that a non-TOA member is unfit to serve on the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.521" offset="3385448">Now the lower court we believe correctly rejected this argument, noting that an irrebuttable presumption does not exist in this case, since no commercial optometrist is conclusively denied membership on the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.204" offset="3440201">Commercial optometry is not prevented from sitting on the Board in those two spaces, as it's evidenced by the fact that Dr. Rogers himself a commercialist over 20 years has been a continuing member of the Board during that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.886" offset="3506866">Additionally, we would submit that there is another reason why the irrebuttable presumption analysis should not be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.055" offset="3539571">We believe that the irrebuttable presumption test appears to demand legislative perfection, yet nearly all legislative classifications on economic regulation contained some degree of imperfection and inaccuracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.521" offset="3597458">Indeed very few acts of the legislature could ever survive the bottom line requirement of the irrebuttable presumption test, i e that the requirement of the legislative classification be an accurate yardstick, to implement the legislative goals 100% of the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.301" offset="3676557">Dr. Roger's next theory is that the Board membership statute violates procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.448" offset="3705187">The thrust of his claim here is that the present and the future TOA Board members will as a matter of law always be prejudiced against commercial optometrists in all future proceedings in all situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.597" offset="3765791">He argues that if the Board majority consists of TOA members, the board is unconstitutional per se for all purposes, including examination, license renewal, and disciplinary actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.513" offset="3817409">We submit that if his argument were to be correct, the present Texas Board consisting of four TOA members would be unconstitutional even if there never had been a Board membership statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.012" offset="3863385">In other words, the constitutionality of the Board would vary from year-to-year depending on how many TOA members were appointed to the Board by the Governor, and we don't think that makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.125" offset="3911868">The lower court rejected this inherent bias analysis, and noted that bias must be proven on a case-by-case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.901" offset="3946977">It cannot be legally presumed as a matter of law as an inference from Association membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.237" offset="3972368">And we submit that bias must be actually proved in the context of specific parties in specific hearings that are pending or which are about to commence.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.711" offset="4018239">In other words, proof of bias in a hypothetical future adjudicatory hearing simply does not allow the illegal presumption of bias in all conceivable future Board functions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1098.321" offset="4496697">I think the legislature can presume that certain persons should not categorize or classifications of persons will be biased toward law enforcement and others may not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1543.076" offset="6275636">I represent the State of Texas and the members of Texas Optometry Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.159" offset="6292041">I will address the issue of a constitutionality of Section 513(d) of the Texas Optometry Act, which provides that no optometrists may practice under or use in a connection with his practice of optometry any trade name, corporate name, assumed name or any name other than the name under which he has license to practice optometry in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.372" offset="6368841">The court below held that this section is unconstitutional under the First Amendment and relied extensively on the holding in Bates versus the State Bar of Arizona, and Virginia Pharmacy Board versus Virginia Consumer Counsel, instead of properly analyzing the state's interest and the First Amendment interest involved in this section, the Court deferred to the advertising cases as being determinative of the outcome in this case and thus struck down the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.149" offset="6468002">If the balancing test in Bates and Virginia Pharmacy is properly applied to this section, it becomes evident that the statute validly promotes important to state interest and inflicts a minimal restriction on First Amendment rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="5078.369" offset="20416867">The reason that Dr. Rogers is not eligible for membership in the TOA is because Dr. Rogers exercises and claims the right to exercise his first amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5093.547" offset="20477576">That is why he is not eligible and that is exactly what the code of ethics of the Texas Optometric Association prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5100.436" offset="20505161">It precluded membership to anyone who advertises price, it precluded membership to anyone who used a trade name and it precluded membership to anyone who operated more than three offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="5113.677" offset="20558033">He applied, he was not eligible and he was disqualified from the membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="5120.054" offset="20583633">He was disqualified because of the expression of his fundamental First Amendment right, whether you call that the ‘right of speech or the right of association'.</text>
            <text syncTime="5130.513" offset="20625429">The case becomes much like that of Turner v. Fouche, decided by this court in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="5138.978" offset="20659284">There the Georgia statute required that to be appointed to a school board, a person had to be a free holder.</text>
            <text syncTime="5147.628" offset="20693870">The court recognized that none of us and certainly Dr. Rogers recognizes that none of us have a right to be considered for public service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5157.579" offset="20733680">However none of us have a constitutional right to be appointed, but we do have a right to be considered for public service without an invidious discriminatory disqualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="5169.803" offset="20782582">And the state may not deny to some the privilege of holding office that extends to others on a basis that violates constitutional guarantee and that's exactly what the state has done in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5184.642" offset="20841932">They have said that because you exercise your First Amendment right, there are four of six seats on that board that you are not eligible to be appointed to and that is plainly and simply the argument made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5198.179" offset="20896057">There is respectfully no rational or legitimate reason for this regulation as colloquy with Mr. Neman(ph) suggested.</text>
