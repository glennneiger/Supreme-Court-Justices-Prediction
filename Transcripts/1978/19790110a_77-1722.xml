            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="10.131" offset="143862">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.284" offset="160475">Petitioner has presented three separate grounds in support of his contention that the agents' surreptitious entry into his unoccupied business premises for the purpose of planting of listening devices that were necessary to carry out the court authorized eavesdropping was unlawful and requires suppression of the intercepted conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.927" offset="251068">First, although he didn’t put it first in his brief, but I think he has continued to maintain the position, he contends that such surreptitious entries are absolutely barred by the Fourth Amendment regardless of the existence of any Congressional authorization for them or the presence of any court order authorizing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.553" offset="333615">Second, he contends that even if such entries could be carried out consistently with the Fourth Amendment, Congress has either prohibited or failed to authorize them in Title III or elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.744" offset="386382">Third, he contends that even if there is no constitutional or statutory barrier to such entries, the agents' action in this case was unlawful because of their failure to procure from the District Court an express authorization of the entries that were necessary to carry out the court’s Title III order.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.177" offset="456077">Now before I begin the argument I think there is a factual background that came up slightly yesterday and there is some misconception around as to the question of the need to make trespassory entries for purposes of planting the listening devices in connection with eavesdropping orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.614" offset="545834">There is language in Berger opinion of this court 10 years ago, which I think was still several decades before its time in terms of talking about electronic beams from outside and what we’ve called in our brief The Buck Rogers kind of equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.025" offset="619499">As matters stand today there are very, very few cases if any of surveillance of interior areas where that kind of equipment is useful as a practical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.593" offset="669759">Similarly the martini olive transmitter and so on is virtually never used in these cases because radio transmitters are not used because they are easily detected by a scanner that you can buy at RadioShack for a few dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.391" offset="740916">So that in the normal case when you are talking about a Title III eavesdropping order of an office or some interior area you are talking about the need for some kind of what was viewed as a trespassory entry prior to Katz.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.245" offset="812387">Now in -- we’ve been advised by the FBI that in perhaps slightly fewer than 10% of the cases the Spike mic through the wall kind of approach is available and that would be normally the cases where the FBI is able to obtain control of the adjoining space, for instance if it’s a hotel room and they can rent the adjoining hotel room or an office and they can rent the adjoining office.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.737" offset="922311">But in all other cases some kind of a physical entry of the agents into the premises together with a fairly extended period of time necessary because this is a wire installation, it’s not a matter of putting a radio transmitter and but of installing something and running wires out to a receiver is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.583" offset="1009664">Now they do use ruses in a certain proportion of the cases, but the vast majority of the cases are entries such as occurred in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.309" offset="1088658">Well, we have cited in our brief about 12 to 14 illustrative instances of testimony before Congress about how surveillances were conducted and it was clear to Congress that trespassory entries of the kind that occurred in this case would be frequently necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="269.172" offset="1180087">Senate report doesn’t mention that subject at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.555" offset="1189595">It does mention the cases in which the Spike Mic was used and some of the other cases where there was no entry, but there is nothing in the Senate report that I could see where they discussed anything like what you’ve just described.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.211" offset="1232227">You do and I’m aware of the fact that there are references in the hearings that you described.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="299.495" offset="1301400">Many of those references indicate that that even a majority of the cases there would be need for a surreptitious entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.740" offset="1326373">They do refer to the need on occasion, but they also cite cases which indicate that frequently it could have been done without a surreptitious entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.234" offset="1356257">So how do, as I’m just wondering what the state of knowledge of the Congress --</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="316.707" offset="1370154">Well, I think that to some extent we must speculate about what individual members of Congress expected.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.428" offset="1401083">However, I will get to the point that there is evidence I think in the Senate report itself that Congress intended to allow the installation of eavesdropping devices of the kind that we have in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="348.885" offset="1498885">No, I think it’s clear, but there is talk and Mr. Ruprecht suggested yesterday that there might be many ways you might insinuate a Confederate or an informant and well that simply is not practical.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.786" offset="1558549">You might use a ruse, but what I’m suggesting is the kind of ruse that you need is one that gives you access to the man’s office for a couple of hours.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="372.024" offset="1591463">I understand that, but the point that interested me was that the Senate report relies very heavily on this Court’s previously decided cases, which included the use of a mic on the outside of a telephone booth and the Spike mic. Well they may not have focused on this problem is all I’m suggesting because of the emphasis on the cases from this Court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="388.875" stopTime="608.858">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="388.875" offset="1658859">Well, I think what, I don’t -- I can’t cite you at the moment any particular place in the legislative history where there is a statement that reflects Congress’s understanding of the facts as I’ve told you this morning, but I think it is clear that they knew and there is absolutely no place in the legislative history that suggests that they intended to prohibit surreptitious entries of the kind that occurred in Berger.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.045" offset="1771604">Let me pass for the moment the broad constitutional contention of petitioners because I think that is sufficiently insubstantial that I should get on to other more important questions in terms of the question of the existence if any is necessary of statutory authority for a surreptitious entry to install listening device.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.657" offset="1865958">Now I believe that on close analysis to answer to this question is fairly clear and it is as we are arguing it, but the Sixth and Ninth Circuits have concluded that there is no power in the Federal judiciary to authorize eavesdropping that entails surreptitious entry into private premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.098" offset="1947773">And these decisions of course are of grave concern to the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.403" offset="1965014">So they have rendered it virtually impossible for the government to use the authority conferred by Title III to intercept oral communications in the effort to combat organized crimes in the State, organized crime in the States within those circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.403" offset="2024991">Now in considering this question of statutory authority I think we should first look at Title III itself and consider three possible conclusions that might be reached about the effect of that enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.931" offset="2071071">The first which is what I understand petitioner’s argument to be is that Title III prohibits surreptitious entries into private premises to install listening devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.580" offset="2113703">The second, which we would contend on the other side is that Title III is itself a source of authority for such entries.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.770" offset="2146408">The third possible conclusion is that Title III neither confers nor withdraws authority, so that the source of authority, if any, specific source is necessary must be sought elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.738" offset="2194369">Now with regard to petitioner’s proposition and I think the conclusion of at least the Ninth Circuit and the Sixth Circuit did give more consideration to alternatives that Title III’s failure to contain express provisions regulating the authorization of trespassory entries to plant listening devices reflects a congressional purpose or at least a congressional accomplishment of the end of banning or withdrawing authority for such entries.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.475" offset="2309308">Now we submit that there is no basis for the court to impute the Congress such bizarre and self defeating action.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.006" offset="2339401">After all while Title III was designed in part to protect the citizenry from unconstitutional invasions of communicational privacy as well as from non governmental invasions of communicational privacy, it was indisputably also intended within constitutional limits to enable law enforcements officers to use electronic surveillance to combat organized crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.564" offset="2433651">And what was the case that Congress was studying most closely in its efforts to design a constitutionally acceptable system to enable law enforcement officers to conduct electronic surveillance, that case was Berger against New York and what was it that the officers did in Berger, that Congress we submit plainly sought to allow in future cases, they surreptitiously entered a business office to plant a listening device.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="608.858" stopTime="617.724">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="608.858" offset="2538768">Mr. Frey at that point, would your argument be the same if the surreptitious entry was into a private residence as distinguished from a business office?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="617.724" stopTime="816.033">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="617.724" offset="2574294">Well we would reach the same conclusion, but it is possible that the court would view the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.740" offset="2610343">I mean we don’t deny that there is some more sensitivity in entering a private home than there is in entering a business office, although both are protected by the warrant clause of the Fourth Amendment, but I think we would ultimately come to the same position.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.013" offset="2683382">Now is it reasonable to conclude that Congress while on the one hand trying to legalize law enforcement eavesdropping in circumstances like the Berger case, on the other hand sub silentio concluded that surreptitious entries such as were in Berger were so offensive that they ought not to be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.290" offset="2756524">It is that implausible premise that petitioner asked this Court to adopt and that underlies the Sixth and Ninth Circuit decisions in Finazzo and Santora. Now I’d just come back and mention that while the legislative history is not as clear as we would like, there is no question that Congress was repeatedly told that the kind of eavesdropping in Berger and that it was studying would often or usually involve surreptitious physical entry into the premises where the conversations are to take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.531" offset="2905527">Now it nevertheless decided to authorize interceptions of oral communications without restriction as to the places where such communications could be intercepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.779" offset="2946487">And in fact we quote a statement by Senator Tydings in our brief at page 38 in which he describes a fact situation very much like Berger and he was one of the principle sponsors of the Bill and states his view that it is offensive that this mafia figure or organized crime figure who he was talking about could not be convicted and that the purpose of the Bill was to facilitate or legalize under appropriate controls the kind of entry to plant a listening device that occurred in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.334" offset="3100714">Now petitioner stresses what he perceives to be the Congressional silence on the subject to surreptitious entries as evidenced that it did not intend to permit them for Title III searches, but Congress was not utterly silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.365" offset="3152854">The Senate report in describing what the legislation generally set out to accomplish and it stated at Page 40 of our brief said, “Legislation meaning the constitutional standard set out in the decisions,” referring to Katz and Berger, “And granting law enforcement officers the authority to tap telephone wires and,” and this is just the key language, “install electronic surveillance devices in the investigation of major crimes and upon obtaining the court order which is the purpose of Title III of S917,” and then they list the groups that have endorsed that legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.869" offset="3314813">So while the statements don’t proliferate on the subject we take that as a clear statement of the congressional intent to authorize this.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.445" offset="3353161">Now we submit that Congress did not dwell --</text>

            <text syncTime="942.538" offset="3873520">Now, it’s our argument that Congress did not dwell on the subject of surreptitious entries because it simply didn’t suspect there was any serious problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.036" offset="3919496">Nothing in any prior decision of this Court had sounded any alarm on this particular subject and of course Rule 41 governing conventional searches itself says nothing about express separate entry authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.057" offset="3979577">We think that Congress assumed that having authorized the search itself and a detailed provision satisfying what it understood the Fourth Amendment to require, it was thereby authorizing the implementation of the search by the means that were reasonably necessary to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.848" offset="4050735">Now at this point I would like to make our position as to the statutory source of authority clear because in reading over our brief and preparing for the argument, I am afraid it may state the matter in a fashion that it’s subject to misinterpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.032" offset="4115519">In Part 2 of our brief, we were addressing the contention of petitioner and the conclusion of the Sixth and Ninth Circuits that Title III does not itself authorize entries to plant listening devices and that accordingly such entries may not occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.236" offset="4176332">We showed convincingly I hope that if that promise was correct, the conclusion was not correct because Rule 41 provides the power to authorize trespassory entries if one must look elsewhere then Title III for such power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.136" offset="4239966">Now we didn’t mean by this argument to suggest that Title III is not itself a source of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.439" offset="4265148">We believe that it is, but we recognize that there are two ways to look at the entry that took place here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.614" offset="4293778">The first which several courts have adapted is to view it as an incident of the search authorized by the Title III order, it's so viewed and we believe this is the best view of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.180" offset="4340067">Title III itself supplies the authority for the entry to carry out the search, just as Rule 41 implicitly authorizes the entry to accomplish a conventional search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.025" offset="4383431">On the other hand several courts have concluded that the entry entails a wholly separate invasion of a distinct constitutionally protected interest rather than an intrusion ancillary to the electronic surveillance with which Title III is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.964" offset="4443199">Under that view, one could perhaps reasonably contend that Title III supplies no authority for the entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.821" offset="4470680">But that conclusion does not resolve the inquiry in petitioner’s favor, rather as we say in our brief, Rule 41 supplies the authority for distinct trespassory intrusions of the kind that petitioner by hypothesis finds present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.394" offset="4536926">Now unless the Court has further questions on the statutory issue, I’ll pass on now to the question of the need for an express entry provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1424.001" offset="5799372">Now it’s undisputed that the Court’s Title III order in this case met all the stated requirements of the warrant clause of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.607" offset="5837824">It was sought under oath, a probable cause was shown and the order particularly described the place to be searched which is of special relevance here and also the things to be seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.919" offset="5887039">The entry was a necessary aspect of the execution of the court’s order, but in our view it was implicitly authorized in the same way as I’ve said before than any entry necessary to execute a conventional search as implicitly authorized by Rule 41 warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.498" offset="5953390">Now in making our argument, we are also not contending and this gets to Justice Rehnquist's point that the Title III order alone suffices to give the agents an unlimited license to do as they please in executing the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.725" offset="6006262">Just as with the conventional search, the agents must act reasonably in the means they select to implement the Title III order and the reasonableness of their actions is subject to post search judicial inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.684" offset="6058088">Here that inquiry occurred and both lower courts found that the surreptitious entry was in fact reasonable and necessary to execute the eavesdrop order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.631" offset="6105945">Now, as I pointed out earlier the vast majority of eavesdropping of enclosed interior locations will require a physical trespass.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.554" offset="6137605">The situation is not materially different from that of a conventional search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.567" offset="6157667">Now, often a single conventional search can involve an intrusion into several arguably distinct privacy interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.116" offset="6195806">Yet, the satisfaction of the express requirements of the warrant clause is normally considered sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.650" offset="6226004">Now, let me give you a hypothetical of a warrant to search the second floor rear room of a house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.250" offset="6264351">In the course of executing that warrant which particularly describes the place to be searched, the officers may hypothetically at least have a choice of entering the front or the back door, walking through the living room or the dining room or some other rooms where they are arguably distinct privacy interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.141" offset="6339897">I am aware of no case which suggest that they have to get a separate warrant or that the magistrate expressly has to describe how they do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.980" offset="6375320">That's not to say that they don’t have to do it reasonably when they go into the premises they can’t go into other bedrooms that are not on the way to the bedroom that they’re authorized to search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.898" offset="6422967">Now, let me come back to a point that Mr. Justice White made yesterday which I think is a very powerful point in our favor on this issue and that is the effect of arrest warrants on the authorization of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.939" offset="6483153">I think the law generally is at least in the lower courts and there is some suggestion implicitly in this Court although I assume the question is open to reexamination that an arrest warrant would authorize the officers to enter the home of the person named in the warrant on at least let’s say probable cause to believe that the person is present in order to carry out the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.892" offset="6578970">Now, this is a very parallel situation to the present situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.027" offset="6595480">Indeed logically our case is, I think stronger because in the case of an arrest warrant, there is a very substantial chance that the individual will be in a public place or alternatively that when you knock at his door, ring his bell, he will come to the door and no entry will be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.178" offset="6664129">Nevertheless, the state of the law in the lower courts at least is clear that the arrest warrant authorizes the entry and I may mention another fact that makes our case much stronger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.031" offset="6703522">We have a description in our Title III order of the location, the entry into which is being challenged here, an arrest warrant would contain no description.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.270" offset="6744482">So it’s difficult for me to see if the Court rules against us in this case how it can be squared with the present doctrine and an arrest warrant appears to justify an entry into the suspect’s premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.605" offset="6797772">Now, finally just to make a couple of or to make one other point, the Court is free, it has the power as Justice Marshall suggested to ask the officers what are you going to do, how are you going to do it to consider restrictions that are deemed wise to impose on the manner of executing the search and I think this is true with conventional searches as well as with the Title III search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.066" offset="6907591">And the existence of this power it seems to me elevates greatly any concern about the agents barging in.</text>
