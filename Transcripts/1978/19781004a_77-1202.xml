            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll hear arguments next in Michigan against Doran.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.882" offset="386905">Mr. Derengoski, I think you can proceed whenever you're ready now.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert A. Derengoski</label>
            <text syncTime="75.607" offset="405817">Chief Justice Burger, members of the Court, I first address the question in this cause of the motion for dismissal on the grounds of mootness, which has been filed by counsel for the respondent herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.649" offset="469974">Now, this is an extradition case.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.218" offset="480214">Exactly one year ago, today the Michigan Supreme Court handed down its decision, setting aside Mr. Doran's incarceration and turning him free on the basis that the extradition papers, the warrant and complaint from Arizona did not in their face show probable cause and that it was an argument in question and objection which could be raised in a habeas corpus proceeding in the asylum State of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.144" offset="611976">Now, the motion for mootness indicates that counsel has searched diligently for Mr. Doran and has been unable to find him and that therefore, any action by this Court could not be effectively implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.810" offset="698598">I say to this Court in opposition to the motion for dismissal on the basis of mootness that we, the State of Michigan, probably somewhat greater resources have attempted not to locate Mr. Doran.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.301" offset="764531">There's no reason for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.295" offset="776547">After all, we couldn't do a thing to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.139" offset="787937">It's going to be only harassment if we did go out and look for him, I presume.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.668" offset="802043">He is free by a mandate of the Michigan Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.764" offset="818448">Now, admittedly, at the moment we do not know where he is.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.309" offset="836629">However, I would hate to say that precedent should be that an appeal to this Court can be thwarted.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.129" offset="883858">Indeed, a party may prevail by merely not showing up, I would say to Your Honors that this is not the concept which would evoke an order of this Court dismissing on the count of mootness, this cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.808" offset="970585">Now, except for this order of the Michigan Supreme Court, which we herein seek to set aside, there is a viable Michigan governor's warrant for the arrest of this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.814" offset="1034637">And once if this Court does set aside the Michigan decree, it will be pursued and pursued diligently.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.257" offset="1068387">Otherwise, the very thing that we are full fearful of, as a result of the Michigan Supreme Court's decision would indeed come true.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.596" offset="1113736">Namely, just keep yourself absent.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.386" offset="1120946">Step over the boundaries into another state and you're home free.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.637" offset="1145919">I have a little doubt Michigan being the home of Mr. Doran and his family or remnants there, are still there that in all likelihood he is in Michigan.</text>

            <text syncTime="293.429" offset="1277053">He's got the mandate of the Michigan Supreme Court keeping him free.</text>

            <text syncTime="340.017" offset="1463463">The concept of probable cause, I suggest to the Court can be somewhat gossamer.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.909" offset="1507035">What is maybe probable cause in the mind of the Governor and the Judge in Arizona may fall shy of probable cause in the minds of the Michigan courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.394" offset="1572968">On the other hand, this case went through four Michigan courts before they found a Court which said, this does not show probable cause within the concept that we have.</text>
