            <text syncTime="9.454" offset="37721">This case presents the question whether evidence obtained in violation of Internal Revenue Service regulations may be admitted at the criminal trial of a taxpayer accused of bribing an Internal Revenue Service agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.282" offset="105117">The Internal Revenue Service manual contains detailed procedures that must be followed before conversations between an agent and a taxpayer may be recorded electronically without the taxpayer's knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.008" offset="163944">In this case, after an IRS agent had been offered a bribe by the respondent, he reported the matter to his immediate supervisor who thereafter directed him to record secretly certain future conversations with respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.977" offset="223817">Although an attempt was made to secure all of the approvals required by the regulations, there was a failure to obtain authorization from the Attorney General of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.763" offset="266971">Accordingly, in the bribery prosecution which the government instituted in the District Court, responded filed a motion to suppress the tape recorded conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.558" offset="310230">The District Court held that the conversations had been obtained in violation of a valid regulation and therefore should be suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.458" offset="345757">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed and we granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.233" offset="364878">Although we accept the conclusion of the District Court and the Court of Appeals that the recordings were obtained in violation of agency regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.647" offset="402495">We hold that there was no violation of any of respondent's constitutional or statutory rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.346" offset="429349">We reject respondent's contention that exclusion is always an appropriate remedy whenever evidence is obtained in violation of a valid regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.253" offset="468950">And further hold that the circumstances involved in this case do not justify the suppression remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.960" offset="495804">We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.640" offset="514508">Mr. Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Brennan has joined.</text>
