            <text syncTime="46.302" offset="288580">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.124" offset="307911">These consolidated cases involve the obligations of producers to supply natural gas under the Natural Gas Act of 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.088" offset="367679">The case concerns a statement of policy developed in an informal rule making proceeding conducted by the predecessor of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.831" offset="426715">The Commission undertook to determine what standard of deliverability, a certificated producer of natural gas is required to live up to under the provisions of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.418" offset="485021">The policy the commission eventually adopted requires producers of dedicated gas to produce gas they are required to supply under their certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.833" offset="550745">Under the standard of a prudent operator as that standard is reflected in state laws governing production.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.154" offset="587943">There are two petitions here; the first is the petition of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which inquires whether the production and gathering exclusion in Section 1B of the Natural Gas Act bars the Commission from adopting the prudent operator standard as the delivery criteria under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.507" offset="689403">The second petition is by the Consumer Energy Council of America and it contends that the Commission has the authority to adopt a deliverability standard that affects production, but it goes on to say that the prudent operator standard is an inappropriate standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.988" offset="791280">The Court of Appeals held that the Commission was barred by Section 1B of the Natural Gas Act, particularly the production and gathering exclusion in Section 1B from adopting a prudent operator standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.772" offset="850422">So the Court of Appeal said that the Commission had gone too far in adopting the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.290" offset="872573">The consumers argue that the Commission did not go far enough and that the prudent operator standard doesn't meet the requirements of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.234" offset="908309">The consumers have with the court's permission conceded three minutes to the Commission in the division of time in this case, so that the commission would have 23 minutes, the consumers 17.</text>

            <text syncTime="218.018" offset="975496">Mr. Shapiro, I wasn't quite as clear as you seem to be as to what question is presented by the Commission's brief, because I realize that the order adopted by the commission says that on or after July 30th, 1976 all Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity will contain this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.878" offset="1050833">And yet, if you turn to page 16 of the brief for the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.404" offset="1069014">The first sentence in the first full paragraph says, the principle issue in this case is whether the Natural Gas Act imposes an obligation on certificate holders, which the Commission has jurisdiction to enforce that they act as reasonably as prudent operators have maintained deliveries to interstate commerce of gas from dedicated reserves and you go on to say that this is going to have viable importance for many, many years, because apparently it is incorporated by force of the Natural Gas Act and certificates issued prior to 1976, is that your position?</text>

            <text syncTime="280.584" offset="1225749">Well, that's a little different than saying that the Commission was empowered to choose this as a regulation implementing the statute isn't it.</text>

            <text syncTime="291.999" offset="1271411">Well, essentially the Commission's position is, it has made an interpretation of the statute to define what the standard of deliverability is.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.637" offset="1309968">What it found in this rule making proceeding was that there was a great deal of uncertainty as to just what producers obligations were to deliver gas and it concluded in the ultimate decision Order Number 539 B, that there was implicit in the delivery obligation that exists under Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.000" offset="1411323">An obligation to maintain delivery that reaches the duty to at least see that there is sufficient gas produced to meet the obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.427" offset="1449044">The commission found that this was implicit in existing certificates and that it was inappropriate interpretation of the statute as the service obligation had been defined by this Court in –</text>

            <text syncTime="352.109" offset="1511842">And this is an interpretative regulation that was adopted by the Commission in 1976.</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="356.698" offset="1530128">Yes Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.991" offset="1535352">One reason that the question had not come to the fore was because as long as there was more gas available then it could meet more gas available in the market would absorb.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.361" offset="1596792">There was a little question that every producer would try to deliver all the gas he could and market all the gas he could.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.375" offset="1632841">When the gas shortage of the late 60s and early 70s developed, questions began to arise as to just what the duty of the producer was.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.766" offset="1674428">Now the Commission's order in this case did not rest on any findings that there had been some diversion of gas to the unregulated intrastate market from the regulated interstate market, but the Commission did find that there was great uncertainty as to the scope of the deliverability obligation and it undertook to define that, it's ultimate answer was that implicit and existing certificates under this Court's decisions in Sunray and for that matter in California versus Southland was an obligation not simply to sell gas as a commodity, but also to deliver gas until there was an authorization from the commission to seize delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.585" offset="1869720">Now Justice Rehnquist's questions have touched on another matter I should briefly mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.330" offset="1892707">In November of 1978, Congress passed the National Gas Policy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.311" offset="1916635">That new statute changes the basis of regulation for the future rather significantly.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.051" offset="1951535">It extends price control to both the intrastate market and the interstate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.973" offset="1979225">However, it also expressly continues in effect non-price regulation under the Natural Gas Act for gas previously dedicated to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.650" offset="2037948">That gas is therefore still impressed with the service obligation that would apply to dedicated gas under the Natural Gas Act and is still subject to the requirement that it continued to be delivered until abandonment authority is obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.130" offset="2103881">The matter is significant because among other things, pricing under the new statute for gas previously dedicated to interstate commerce is somewhat lower than prices for other categories of gas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1339.107" offset="5459780">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.416" offset="5473050">Our basic contention in this litigation is that the Commission has acted contrary to the terms of the Natural Gas Act by adopting as the standard and the exclusive standard governing producer delivery obligations under the Act, a body of state law which has been developed in the various producers states, which has been developed for reasons altogether different than continuation of steady and reliable supply of natural gas in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.694" offset="5598124">There's of course also a fundamental jurisdictional question here that is whether or not the Commission has the authority to enforce those obligations, which in fact certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.549" offset="5645563">I would like to leave that jurisdictional question largely to our briefs into the argument of Mr. Shapiro, but I would like to make one comment and that is the comment that focuses on the distinction between what we say the Act requires, and what the Commission has done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.948" offset="5715153">We say the act requires an extension of the provisions or an application of the provisions of Section 4(d) and Section 7(b) to significant declines in service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.316" offset="5764681">That means that the Commission would be interposed between the producer and the ultimate consumer and would pass upon the justification for significant declines in delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.531" offset="5817448">That also means that an order from the Commission would not be in the form of an order telling a producer to drill a particular well in this place or take some action in some other place, which might be the case under a prudent operator standard, but the order that would emanate from the Commission is basically the sort of order that would emanate from the Commission when a producer currently comes to the Commission and says under 4(d), we would like to reduce service or under 7(b) we would like to have a partial abandonment that is either yes or no, we accept your justification for a decline in service or we don't accept that justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.737" offset="5970317">So the orders that we can see coming from the Commission in the course of applying a proper delivery standard will not embroil the Commission in questions of where a particular well should be located or what actions should be taken in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.352" offset="6044818">Now, this case takes its significance from the fact that a vast network of investment from that of the pipeline to the end-user, power plant, factory or consumer has been built upon the supply obligations under the Natural Gas Act, and these investments and the interest of those end-users will be placed significantly at risk if the Commission lacks the jurisdiction to enforce delivery obligations under the Act or fails to do so under a proper standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.992" offset="6179297">It is clear from Section 4 and Section 7 of the Act that one of the prime purposes of the Act is to ensure a steady and reliable service or supply of gas in the interstate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.238" offset="6228302">This Court has repeatedly recognized that purpose as recently as last May in the Southland decision where the Court held that the obligation to continue service even in the face of terms in a private agreement, which may run contrary to that obligation, was nevertheless essential to carry out the purposes of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1644.036" offset="6679489">One, a body of state statutory and regulatory law, which has been designed to place limits on production in order to avoid waste and another body of state law, which has been designed to govern the lessor/lessee agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1746.440" offset="7089089">So they seem to think that those decisions give them some authority, but they think that authority allows them to reach out and grab a body of diverse state laws and use that as the Federal standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.960" offset="7135169">And we say that those decisions don't authorize that and that there's nothing in the Act or the legislative history, which would authorize that sort of step to develop a Federal service standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="1796.165" offset="7288038">Shell Oil has argued that the private contract between the pipeline and producer contains no firm delivery obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.471" offset="7325236">In that case, one can imagine the next step in the Sunray or Southland situation where the producer says not that my contract is come to an end and therefore I want to stop service, but that my contract allows me to supply whatever I want to supply at my discretion and for that reason I won't even go to the Commission to get approval under 4(d) or 7(b) for that reduction in service.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Hill</label>
            <text syncTime="1831.961" offset="7431189">That leaves the exclusion of the operation of the exclusion in essentially the same place that it is with respect to the Commission's current application of 4(d) or 7(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.246" offset="7472358">The Commission currently when a producer comes in and says I would like to abandon this particular field, listens to it's justification and decides whether or not that abandonment is in fact justified and if it decides that the abandonment is not justified, it issues an order that says no, you shall continue to serve the interstate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.946" offset="7551143">And all we are asking for and all we think the Act requires is an application of that principle to the situation of significant declines during the course of the contract and during the course of a certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.170" offset="7600044">I might point out that in the Sunray case at 364 U.S. 156, the Court especially refereed to Section 4(d) of the Act in saying that its decision in that case did not make the producer a captive of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.683" offset="7670053">The producer always had the opportunity to come to the Commission and ask for a reduction in service under Section 4(d) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.971" offset="7711222">I believe that there is a third reason why the Commission's activity here has run a file of Natural Gas Act and that is what the Commission has essentially done by adopting a body of state law is to pull the service obligation out from under a firm Federal standard under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.608" offset="7793768">The Commission has resisted our efforts to point to the FPC versus Texaco case in this regard, what we think that the commission has done essentially the same thing in a service area here that it attempted to do there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.239" offset="7852283">They tried to pull small producer rates out from under the regulatory scheme of the Act and leave them to be governed by free market decisions of the small producer and the pipeline involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.996" offset="7903378">Here what the Commission is sought to do is to pull service obligations out from under the Act and allow those service obligations to be governed by the free market decision between the lessor and lessee and as this Court indicated in Texaco that, that form of price deregulation was not authorized by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.294" offset="7984567">I think also this form of service deregulation is not authorized by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.563" offset="8009644">Now the Commission does not contest our position on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.541" offset="8037543">The Commission does not claim that there is a particular provision in the Act that authorizes this effort to pick up a body of state law and have that be the delivery obligation under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.249" offset="8076413">It doesn't point to anything in the legislative history and it doesn't really point to anything firm in the decisions of this Court, which would seem to authorize that rather unusual effort to develop a Federal service standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.090" offset="8127718">Indeed, there a number of decisions this Court which have found very heavily upon that sort of patch work result and I might as in aside point out that at page 17 of our reply brief, we sight to a report which lays out the various provisions of state law and I think that the Court from looking at that Commission report that we sighted in a footnote on page 17 can see then in fact state laws will differ widely in terms of their obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.921" offset="8259062">The obligations they place upon the producer on questions of allocation, on questions of pooling, on questions of space.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.126" offset="8319875">So what the Commission really is doing here is adopting sort of a patch work solution of the Federal service standard, but indicates that the Commission does not point anything in the Act to legislative history or the decisions of this Court, which would seem to authorize this rather unusual step in developing a Federal service standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.039" offset="8375568">Rather it says that the decision of the Commission is due grade deference from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.034" offset="8399496">Our first response of that is that whatever standard this Court might apply this standard; this effort is so far beyond the reaches of the Act that it should be set aside, but I think the Court need not go that far in terms of applying a different standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.891" offset="8470967">What the Commission has said here is that it is interpreting the service obligations that flow from Section 7 of the Act and I believe that the Court of Appeals in the Fifth Circuit fully recognized that at page 3(a) and 4(a) of our petition for certiorari where we have reprinted the Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.046" offset="8555604">It is apparent that the court realized that what the Commission was doing was engaging in an Act of interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.124" offset="8587891">As such, under the past opinions of this Court, I don't believe that, that effort of statutory interpretation is due grade deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.349" offset="8620805">The Commission was not here exercising the sort of authority that it has under Section 5 of the act, which is basically a legislatively delegated rule making function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.988" offset="8663333">It was simply engaging the statutory of interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.139" offset="8679946">Thus the decision of this Court last term in National Citizen's Committee for Broadcasting versus FCC, I think is in apposite as are the other opinions, which have been sighted by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.522" offset="8737416">Under the proper standard of review, no undue deference is required here and in fact, seeing this as an effort at statutory construction, it is important to note this is neither a consistent or a long standing interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.569" offset="8801677">This is not a interpretation that people have relied upon as was the case in Natural Resources Defense Council versus Train, which was decided by this Court several years ago and which has been relied upon by the Commission nor is it a decision that draws heavily upon a great deal of experience from the Commission, because as Mr. Shapiro has admitted this constitutes, this Order 539(b) constitutes the Commission's first effort at interpreting or defining the service standard, which flows from the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.372" offset="8932812">And as such, in reaching out for this body of state law, the Commission in fact justified its actions simply by saying that it was doing so, because the producers had become acquainted with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.873" offset="8982862">I submit that, that is hardly a sound basis for deference on the part of this Court to a decision of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.358" offset="9024763">A question has been raised as to whether or not interpreting the service obligation on the Act may pose some problems of retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.113" offset="9063842">I think what the Commission should have done here, what the Commission says it did was to interpret those obligations and as in the Sunray case where again the Commission was interpreting a certificate obligation, which had retroactive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.401" offset="9120998">That statutory interpretation; that defining of the service obligation raises no retroactivity problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.598" offset="9149733">In addition, as long as the Commission adopts an approach, which allows the producer to come in and show justification for declining reserves or declining deliveries, then I think further there is no problem of confiscation or unfairness to the producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.454" offset="9237191">So, in summary, we submit that the Commission has acted beyond the authority granted it and reaching out for this body of state law and defining it as the Federal service standard that it is position here deserves no grade deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.690" offset="9310124">And that this Court should reverse the Court of Appeals decision and remand this action back to the Commission for further consideration in light of other requirements of Section 7 and section 4 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.285" offset="9372505">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2327.245" offset="9412315">My name is Thomas G. Johnson representing Shell Oil Company and appearing here on behalf of the producer respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.247" offset="9440319">In this case, the court is again asked to reexamine the distinction between production and gathering, which is excluded from the Commission's jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act and sale for resale, which is specifically included.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.615" offset="9489847">For some 20 years, since this Court's decision in Philips this distinction was thought to be cleared by the industry and by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.538" offset="9521507">And to read what the Court said in Philips in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.573" offset="9537703">I would like to the quote the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.827" offset="9546689">“In FPC versus Panhandle Eastern, we observed that the natural and clear meaning of the phrase “production or gathering of natural gas” is that it encompasses the producing properties and gathering facilities of the Natural Gas Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.486" offset="9597367">Similarly, in Colorado Interstate versus FPC, we stated the transportation in sale does not include production and gathering and indicated that the production and gathering exemption applies to the physical activities, facilitates and properties used in the production and gathering of natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.316" offset="9672600">In the Philips case, the producer had argued that he was in the business of producing and gathering natural gas and that sale for resale was incidental to that business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.545" offset="9709589">And therefore was not subject to Commission jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.512" offset="9721396">The Commission so found, but this Court disagreed and said that there was distinction between the physical activity, which the producer was engaged in and was excluded from the Commission's jurisdiction and the sale for resale which was covered by Commission jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.425" offset="9789106">In this case, the Commission makes exactly the opposite argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.870" offset="9802898">They argue that production is incidental to the sale and therefore the Commission must regulate production in order to assure that the sale will continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.939" offset="9839156">That argument should be rejected for the same reason that the producers' argument in Philips was rejected and that reason is that it destroys the clear distinction imposed by congress between production and gathering and sale for resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.868" offset="9890879">The only other case which this Court has dealt with the distinction between production and gathering and sale is UGI versus Continental Oil Company, Rayne Field case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.978" offset="9931316">And there again, the Court reiterated this distinction in this language, “We conclude that even though a sale of natural gas and interstate commerce occurs before production or gathering is ended, it is nonetheless subject to regulation and the context to such a sale as distinguished from the situation on FPC versus Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company to be discussed hereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.970" offset="10015222">The production or gathering exemption relates to the physical activities, process and facilities of production or gathering, but not to sales of the kind that are primarily subject to Commission jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.242" offset="10060361">This accommodation of the two relevant clauses of Section 1(b) gives content to the national objectives of the Natural Gas Act as expounded in Philips and to the Commission's jurisdiction to accomplish them, while in no way interfering with the state regulatory power over the physical processes of production or gathering in furtherance of conservation or other legitimate state concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.518" offset="10161403">We believe Mr. Justice Rehnquist that the reason why the Commission had never sought to exercise jurisdiction over the production activities prior to this case was that those activities were actively being regulated by the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.651" offset="10213961">This was the case even before the Natural Gas Act was passed in 1938.</text>

            <text syncTime="2856.772" offset="11530428">Keep in mind that a gas field is continually declining in production and that's the problem with the standard which says that a producer must maintain service, because that's usually physically impossible for the producer to do because the gas field is continually declining and the ability of the wells to produce is continually being reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.429" offset="11629066">Now the question is whether the producer can do something at some point in time to delay that decline or differ the loss of production from these wells and those are very difficult questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.045" offset="11683506">The question usually comes out if a well loses production, can that production be restored by drilling a new well or can it be restored by installing pumping facilities to remove the waters, which is encroached and chocked off the gas or can explosives are acid be used to increase the permeability of the wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.505" offset="11757380">All of these things are decisions requiring expert judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.213" offset="11772217">Now, we think if the effect of this decision is that the Commission supervises all of those production decisions that the producers will be embroiled in litigation before the Commission repeatedly in an attempt to justify their production decisions and we think that's gong to detract from the search for new gas supply, which is the only way that the gas supply can really be increased.</text>

            <text syncTime="3029.263" offset="12220374">It is difficult to see what more the producer can be required to do then what he is required to do under the state standards, which is to operate with due diligence and as a reasonably prudent operator under the circumstances of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.802" offset="12278575">He certainly can't be required to maintain service from the gas field where the gas is already been produced.</text>

            <text syncTime="3569.958" offset="14383208">One very brief statement Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.315" offset="14396583">First, the State's do not require production in aid of interstate delivery obligation under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.013" offset="14431378">That is the regulatory gap.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.399" offset="14440991">Second, the producers have stated the obligation is to deliver only what they choose to produce, if they choose not to produce or they choose not to maintain their equipment, there will be no gas to deliver, hence there is no delivery obligation and that will destroy, seriously undermine the dedication concept recognized in Sunray and subsequent cases.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3608.124" offset="14535868">You mean, there would be no contract delivery obligation.</text>

          <turn speaker="howard_shapiro" startTime="3610.408" stopTime="3625.847">
            <label>Mr. Howard Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="3610.408" offset="14544959">There will be no delivery obligation under the statutes Your Honor, because the contract obligation is not what controls under the Natural Gas Act, but the service obligation resulting from the certification of the sale that's the doctrine of summary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3625.847" offset="14606712">I mean you are conceding that if they deliberately don't maintain their equipment, they don't have any obligation?</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard Shapiro</label>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3632.868" offset="14634820">So you are saying that is their view of the statute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="3634.313" offset="14640671">I'm sorry I misunderstand your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.643" offset="14649971">There remains a duty under the statute to deliver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.803" offset="14666585">The Court of Appeals rather inconsistency said the FERC, this is a petition on Page 7(a) the FERC can enforce service obligations contained in the certificates that it issues to producers preventing producers from ceasing delivers from fields admittedly capable of continuing production.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.739" offset="14746311">Now the word admittedly I assume refers to admitted by the producer, but if in fact the field can produce and all it is required is the ordinary prudent actions to keep it producing then what the Commission is saying here is simply that they should take those steps to assure that they produce what they have undertaken to deliver and that is the essence of the prudent operator standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.413" offset="14852995">Finally, the consumers argue that the standard goes too far, but the standard is designed to accommodate with state law, it is not designed to conflict with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.446" offset="14905135">It does not conflict with it.</text>
