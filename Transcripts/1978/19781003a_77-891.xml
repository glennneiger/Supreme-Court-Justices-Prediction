            <text syncTime="953.708" offset="3918242">But the real problem here is that we keep referring to the responsible physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.997" offset="3939349">And in that time period between the invalidation of Pennsylvania's original and maybe 100-year-old abortion statute, the invalidation of that and the passage of this, the Pennsylvania legislature and the governor as well held hearings, public hearings to determine the state of medical arts and problems dealing with abortion in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.369" offset="4024822">And one conclusion came to the forefront with respect to abortion practice; physicians were in many respects creating a crisis with medical care insofar as the woman patient is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.072" offset="4083649">The same physicians bitterly thought in the court below the requirement that they had to test for pregnancy before they would perform an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.522" offset="4121475">Secondly, they also bitterly thought any regulation that would require them to explain the procedure and the complications to their patient and one witness in particular presents a rather dramatic story.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.991" offset="4175287">Her name is Mary Ellen Gallagher, she was a news reporter for WCAU TV in Philadelphia and she post as a teenager who fear that she was pregnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.265" offset="4220426">She went to numerous abortion clinics and hospitals and spoke with doctors there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.060" offset="4239653">She absolutely certifiably was not pregnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.021" offset="4251460">But to a one they put her up on the table and were beginning an abortion before she stepped down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.752" offset="4278418">No pregnancy testing for the most part, no responsible medical care that we are talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.211" offset="4304227">So, Pennsylvania has come to the conclusion -- the legislature has -- that we need legislation in this area to, first of all, prior to viability to protect maternal health.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.624" offset="4353860">And now we're saying by the position taken by appellees and the amicus as far as being immune from prosecution in this area, a crisis with respect to the viable that maybe defective child.</text>

            <text syncTime="1306.961" offset="5331257">But my concern here is that we're going to walk out of here and lose this case because of a poor choice of words and physicians now will fill themselves in the position of being able as the amicus are arguing and the appellees have argued in the lower court that is only parental choice that governs when we're talking about viable life or rather -- what I considered to be a rather shocking statement that I would like to read to you from the appellees brief says that a fetus is not viable unless it has meaningful life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.912" offset="5475035">They're asking this Court to extend the concept, okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.879" offset="5490918">So that if through amniocentesis and quite possibly a failure of the original culture to grow and testing, a couple finds themselves after viability to be -- soon to be the parents of a deformed child and they don't want the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.766" offset="5558418">They are asking this Court to say that life is not meaningful, therefore the child is not viable and consequently the parents now have the choice to destroy that child in utero.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.053" offset="5615574">And they said a child doomed to lose all function and become vegetable by the age of three and to die by the age of seven or eight is hardly capable of “meaningful life” from their discussion on viability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.208" offset="5676178">And with all due respect to this Court I don't think any of us are in the position to say that life is not meaningful because it suffers a handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.191" offset="5708152">Our legislature has clearly chosen to -- regardless of handicap or birth defect or race or sex or whatever, represent the interest of the viable child in utero, the viable child and we are asking this Court to recognize that and make a positive statement with reference to the right of the state where it is now chosen to represent the interest of that viable but maybe defective unborn child.</text>

            <text syncTime="1442.219" offset="5872201">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.864" offset="5886830">The lower court in this case chose two distinct if interrelated lines of analysis with which to approach this statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.770" offset="5926431">Their first line was based on an assessment of the substantive legal architecture which this Court mainly through Mr. Justice Blackmun's opinions has accorded the abortion question as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.564" offset="5985677">The second line of analysis which the lower court employed related to that doctrine generally known as the void for vagueness concept as applied by this Court to its work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.229" offset="6052237">The lower court found and I submit to you here correctly that with respect to both lines of analysis the Pennsylvania statute failed its constitutional tasks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.725" offset="6110229">First, it carved out areas in which the State intruded its interests in the abortion context which areas precede that time with in which this Court has found a State had a compelling interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.266" offset="6192462">Secondly, the court found that the statute as applied to an individual under whatever source you use in the void for vagueness analysis failed to provide sufficiently precise information with respect to which an individual could judge his criminal liability and I might add there is a civil liability concept in the statute as you will see paragraph two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.642" offset="6321925">Let me first, if I may, address myself to the substantive abortion question as it has been described by this Court, I think the major two cases that we would all agree were Roe and Danforth as they apply in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.482" offset="6397262">We don't have here a Maher case or a Bellotti case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.240" offset="6408338">We have here a straight Roe statute passed after Roe which was very similar to the statute in Danforth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.983" offset="6451284">The court will remember that Danforth also included as did the Pennsylvania statute issues of consent but they are not now before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.741" offset="6486288">The Danforth -- court likewise was faced with a question respecting what protection had to be given to the fetus and the Danforth statute provided somewhat more sweepingly than the Pennsylvania statute that if an abortion were to be performed, the fetus had to be accorded that method of performance which would most certainly assure its life if it were viable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.171" offset="6612093">That was the way the Danforth statute approached the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.477" offset="6633305">Incidentally both the Danforth statute and the Hodgson statute provided that if you did deliver such a viable fetus for the fact that the parents didn't want it and that provided a sort of an escape clause, the state would take over the fetus.</text>

            <text syncTime="2814.666" offset="11361991">Finally, let me turn if I may from the area which is carved out of Roe and Danforth by the “may be viable” language and incidentally in Hodgson, the Eight Circuit so found on the words potentially viable the appeal was dismissed in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.830" offset="11442657">And moved then to what I think you must do on a vagueness analysis and I will make this brief but I want to call to the court's attention that starting with Thornhill moving through Connolly and Winters and Keyishian now, you have clearly when an individual right was inhibited or circumscribed or threatened, held the statute or the state officer to a high standard of certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.438" offset="11625096">It is not sufficient when threatening an individual right as you do here with respect to both doctor and the mother both of which rights we assert, to say as you might to a state officer your actions must be constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.885" offset="11694895">You may say that to a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.353" offset="11700746">Indeed under civil rights statutes you have convicted state officers for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.651" offset="11717987">But that I think you have been unwilling to say, and I ask you to remain continuingly unwilling to say, that you may make a private citizen operating in an area which maybe protected and which is private subject to the same standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.099" offset="11775770">And if this statute if any statute accomplishes precisely that goal, I think Roe suggested the conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.779" offset="11814536">I think Danforth and Hodgson make it clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="2936.513" offset="11849435">There was a question that underlay a great deal of testimony in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.684" offset="11866154">That was a fundamental question and that was, “What really is an abortion?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.532" offset="11885484">Is it the termination of a woman's impending motherhood or is it that plus destruction of the fetus or a viable child?</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.312" offset="11940655">And it is our position that with respect to the methods applicable, the appellees failed to show that there was not a safe method, but their arguments are all based on what plaintiff, Dr. John Franklin said and that is, that it's his belief and he said, “I've thought about this a great deal and it's my belief that the right to live is that somebody wants you to live.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.359" offset="12040756">And if the mother doesn't want you to live then the physician should be able to perform an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.967" offset="12063222">And he meant at any time for the purpose not just of terminating the pregnancy but destroying the fetus as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.444" offset="12097181">And I leave you with that thought and ask you again to recognize the state's interests in the rights to the viable child.</text>
