            <text syncTime="74.719" offset="402265">Mr. Chief Justice and then may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.715" offset="426193">The central issue in this case may be stated as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.214" offset="452211">Does the Investment Company Act of 1940 deprive the disinterested directors of the mutual fund of their power to terminate a stockholders' derivate action, which those directors in good faith have concluded is contrary to the best interests of the fund and its shareholders?</text>
            <text syncTime="113.486" offset="557328">The District Court held that the disinterested directors in the exercise of their good faith business judgment have the power to terminate such an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.624" offset="605915">The Court of Appeals held that as a matter of law, the directors have no such power irrespective of the fact that they acted in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.698" offset="654190">Certain subsidiary issues are also raised in this case and they will emerge in my later discussion of the plaintiffs point in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.322" offset="704658">The facts are set forth chronologically in our main brief, the white covered brief that pages 4 through 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.481" offset="745305">In the interest of moving promptly to the central legal issue in this case I will simply summarize the highlights at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.982" offset="787310">In November 1969, Fundamental Investors, the mutual fund involved in this case, purchased $20 million of the commercial paper of Penn Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.479" offset="833285">The commercial paper of Penn Central was rated, prime, the highest rating by NCO, a subsidiary of Dun &amp; Bradstreet which is the foremost independent rating agency in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.242" offset="892322">In June 1970, Penn Central filed for reorganization and defaulted on the notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.925" offset="919071">Numerous people were caught in the default as well as Fundamental Investors, banks, trust companies, charities, universities many other sophisticated and able investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.177" offset="968077">In November 1970, the Board of Directors of Fundamental authorized a lawsuit against Goldman Sachs, the dealer which had sold the paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.037" offset="1011545">That suit proceeded vigorously for several years as part of a multi-district proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.562" offset="1041638">In February 1973, three years after the purchase, two stockholders holding very minimal shares filed a derivate action against Anchor Corporation, the investment advisor to Fundamental, and against the Directors of Fundamental at the time of the purchase, that is to say the 1969 directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.981" offset="1139336">That action was stayed by Judge Gurfein, pending resolution of the claims of Fundamental Investors against Goldman Sachs.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.275" offset="1172459">In July 1974, on the eve of trail of the action between Fundamental and Goldman Sachs there was a settlement pursuant on to which Fundamental was paid five million two hundred fifty thousand dollars in cash and also the balance of their claim in the notes of Penn Central and reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.021" offset="1259499">The board of directors --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="290.147" offset="1263992">Has the value of those yet been ascertained?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_a_pollack" startTime="292.269" stopTime="425.326">
            <label>Mr. Daniel A. Pollack</label>
            <text syncTime="292.269" offset="1272456">The exact value is not a matter of record, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.285" offset="1288547">However, I believe that the card indication is that the additional paper may be worth as much as $3 million or $4 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.796" offset="1326582">The Board of Directors of Fundamental promptly convened and determined that it would review the Lasker action, that is to say the derivative action, and that the five disinterested Directors among them who were not defendants in the Lasker action, who had not been Directors at the time of purchase and who were not affiliated in any way with Anchor, would constituting quorum, determine what posture the fund should take with respect to that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.425" offset="1453119">Those five disinterested Directors there upon retained independent special counsel, former Chief Judge of the State of New York, Stanley H. Fuld and they instructed him to prepare a comprehensive memorandum and report on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.947" offset="1515186">Judge Fuld studied the matter for several months and in December issued a report to the disinterested directors, in which he concluded that neither Anchor nor any of the fund directors had violated any law or any contractual or other obligation to Fundamental Investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.514" offset="1585403">The disinterested directors then deliberated the matter among themselves in a serious of special meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.517" offset="1609435">They interrogated people in the fund, they interrogated people from Anchor, they questioned Judge Fuld, they communicated extensively and among themselves they had no contact with anyone from Anchor.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.153" offset="1667950">In early January 1975, those five disinterested directors put the matter to a vote and unanimously determined that the maintenance of these derivative action against the advisor and the directors was contrary to the best interests of the fund and they determined that they would move to dismiss the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.834" offset="1746735">The motion to dismiss was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.141" offset="1755930">Judge Walker said that the disinterested directors acting for the Board had the power to determine in the good faith exercise of their business judgment, that this suit should be terminated.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="425.326" offset="1804727">This action was taken by a quorum, a lawful quorum of the Board, was it not?</text>

          <turn speaker="daniel_a_pollack" startTime="430.130" stopTime="610.464">
            <label>Mr. Daniel A. Pollack</label>
            <text syncTime="430.130" offset="1823848">Yes, it was Mr. Chief Justice and in that respect the plaintiffs at the time of motion to dismiss before Judge Walker, questioned the independence of these interested directors and Judge Walker promptly ordered discovery on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.929" offset="1891140">There was extensive discovery, spanning several months.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.899" offset="1902947">Over thousand pages of testimony was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.142" offset="1911933">There were several document productions.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.228" offset="1920293">The motion was then renewed and Judge Walker found that there was no basis, no factual basis to question the independence of these directors and he granted the motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.217" offset="1968253">Thereafter the Court of Appeals reversed and they held that as a matter of law, irrespective of whether the directors had acted in good faith, they were deprived by the Investment Company Act of the power to make such a decision on behalf of the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.656" offset="2033977">In effect, the Court of Appeals, although it didn’t use these words, said that the disinterested directors couldn’t be trusted.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.715" offset="2070235">I turn to the legal analysis at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.030" offset="2091447">The starting point of the legal analysis is Delaware Corporation Law, Section 141A.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.762" offset="2126451">The Court will find that reproduced in the addendum to our main brief, the white covered brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.229" offset="2152260">The language of 141A says just this “The business and affairs of every corporation organized under this chapter shall be managed by or under the direction of a Board of Directors.”</text>
            <text syncTime="527.237" offset="2212342">Fundamental is a Delaware Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.347" offset="2220805">It fits squarely within that provision and we believe that the directors of Fundamental as a Delaware Corporation had and have the power to mange the affairs of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.749" offset="2270333">This Court has long held in a line of cases is going back 75 to 100 years that that power includes the power to determine whether or not claims shall be prosecuted on behalf of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.134" offset="2331878">This Court in the Corbus and United Copper cases which are the two seminal cases following (Inaudible) said as follows and I quote two sentences from Corbus “A court of equity may not me called upon at the appeal of any single stockholder to compel the directors of the corporation to enforce every right which it may posses, irrespective of other considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.345" offset="2448802">It is not a trifling thing for a stockholder to attempt to coerce the directors of a corporation to act which their judgment does not approve or to substitute his judgment for theirs.”</text>
            <text syncTime="599.561" offset="2501569">And that states the business judgment Rule as it as been enunciated by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="984.299" offset="4040600">In the 1970 amendments, Congress added a new section to A19 in that section which created the new category of disinterested directors they sought to remedy the criticism of the prior category of unaffiliated directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.300" offset="4112593">And they filtered the new definition of the disinterested directors which was a far most stringent one to qualify through the Act in Section 10, Section 15, Section 32.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.194" offset="4164106">We believe as the Senate Report 91 184 shows and we have quoted that in our brief that Congress believed that in so doing it had created the necessary simuse in these directors to fulfill the functions of passing on matters that involved the advisor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1044.804" offset="4282598">Tannenbaum, Fogo and Kaufman, the logic of them is not distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.923" offset="4303078">In each of those three cases the Court of Appeals in two cases for the Second Circuit in the one case for the First Circuit clearly indicate that there is a business judgment Rule applicable to mutual funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.109" offset="4355845">We do not believe that the plaintiffs have come up with a single case or that the Court of Appeals came up with the single case which shows in any way that the Investment Company Act deprived the disinterested directors of there business judgment powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.351" offset="4424808">In that regard we are pleased of course by the position of the government in this case because the SEC in a rare display of support for the defendant has said as its central thesis and supporting our central thesis of power in the disinterested directors here and I quote from there brief, “although Congress could have prohibited the disinterested directors from exercising business judgment in the circumstances of this case, it did not do so.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1518.937" offset="6179088">The Securities and Exchange Commission believes that an understanding of the relationships between State and Federal Law as they impact upon the governance of investment companies is critical to a resolution of the issues presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.722" offset="6234258">First, we agree with the petitioners that corporate directors and not federal judges should be given the fullest opportunity under State Law and under the Investment Company Act of 1940 to manage the business affairs of investment companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.131" offset="6291937">On the other hand, we agree with the respondents and the Court of Appeals that the Investment Company Act of 1940 superimposes upon basic State Law provisions, a pervasive array of federal controls, controls which we believe create federal standards to assure that the operation of the Act will not be frustrated by the possible laxity of the law of an individual state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.220" offset="6388276">Now, the proper reconciliation of both the State and Federal interests, we believe, would be to prohibit as a matter of Federal Law that as interested directors of an investment company from terminating even non frivolous derivative litigation nor however would that law or would that reconciliation embrace the most recent State Court formulation of the Delaware Business Judgment Rule as the sole standard by which to judge directorial action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.886" offset="6502902">Rather we believe that the State and the Federal interests can be balanced by according full discretion to the directors' judgments so long as they are independent, they are fully informed and they act reasonably.</text>

            <text syncTime="1940.533" offset="7865553">Now you are quite correct procedurally this case involves the disposition of the derivative action and in the context where a Federal District Court Judge was being asked in a contested claim in a voluntary dismissal whether the action should be dismissed and the Federal District Court Judge was faced with the situation of whether to dismiss the action over the objections of the plaintiffs who had instituted the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.050" offset="7947577">In that context the Federal District Court Judge was forced to sort out the basis upon which he dismissed the action and he did that by we think reference to both State Law standards, the Delaware Law, independence in good faith and by reference to the federal standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.683" offset="8026154">I quite frankly think that if Tannenbaum against Zeller, the case that we cite is authority for the three-prong test that we urge in our brief had been decided at the time this District Court Judge had before him the dismissal of this action that his conduct in the action may have been a little different and his decision may have read slightly differently.</text>

            <text syncTime="3050.525" offset="12305429">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.433" offset="12317132">Late in 1969 the mutual fund here purchased $20 million worth of Penn Central notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.417" offset="12345031">The record clearly establishes that it entered into this purchase at the suggestion of its advisor Anchor Corporation in a situation where there was absolutely no investigation whatsoever conducted as to the propriety of this $20 million investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.290" offset="12416502">This occurred even though Anchor was at the time receiving some $4 million per year for allegedly managing the portfolio of this investment fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.504" offset="12461432">Now in buying the notes not only did Anchor fail to conduct any investigation, but it failed over the next six or seven months to be aware of the increasing storm signs and warnings as to the dismal failing condition of Penn Central and failed to even execute a buyout or a sellout of the notes when it might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.391" offset="12556936">Moreover there was an internal guideline in the fund, which said that the fund should not purchase commercial paper of this nature unless it had a commitment that it could sell it, the so called buyback commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.347" offset="12620779">Now in the reply brief, my adversary has said that we have misleadingly asserted that this buyback provision was violated because Anchor believed that it had such an understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.123" offset="12671875">Yet Judge Fuld disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.467" offset="12685249">He stated at page 113 of the appendix, accordingly it appears that there was not and that Anchor did not believe there was an illegal binding agreement by Goldman Sachs to repurchase Penn Central paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.756" offset="12742405">Therefore, I think the case comes before Your Honors in the situation where you have, in my judgment and in the judgment of the Court of Appeals, a rather strong showing of breach of fiduciary duty and gross abuse of trust in violation of the 1940 act by Anchor and by the directors at that time of the mutual fund.</text>

            <text syncTime="3210.147" offset="12943966">Well as I’ll come to in a moment I do think that the merits of the action do very much bear on the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.523" offset="12977507">Now as the court is aware there was this lawsuit brought by the Fund against Goldman Sachs alleging fraud and misrepresentation at the time of the purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.788" offset="13022542">Now that suit was settled for slightly over 25% of the loss and I must advise the Court that one of the reasons that motivated the Fund to settle was because it had a sophisticated advisor and it was worried that if it pressed a litigation the effect of its having an allegedly sophisticated advisor might militate against recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.290" offset="13112508">Now even if you take the $5 million that’s been recovered and you ascribe whatever value you want to these pieces of paper that have been issued to the Fund as additional settlement value, there is still a shortfall here of $10 million, $12 million, $15 million, which we believe should be recouped from Anchor and from the defendant directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.870" offset="13202892">Now after the action against Goldman Sachs was settled the motion which leads us to this Court today was interposed by the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.980" offset="13255241">Now it’s significant to note that shortly after the Penn Central collapse the Board of Directors of the fund determined to sue Goldman Sachs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.131" offset="13299858">They also determined to hold in abeyance any other action against anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.802" offset="13322533">Now, over the years between that time in 1970 and 1974 when a dismissal motion was interposed, the fund board of directors did change and composed a five-member minority of the board who are independent and unaffiliated with Anchor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.284" offset="13396511">It was these minority directors who ultimately determined to seek dismissal of this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.487" offset="13425351">Now, initially when the motion was made in the District Court, the District Court permitted discovery and it appears on page 20 of the appendix on a very, very limited claim. He permitted discovery to pursue the relationship of the minority directors and the qualifications committee to determine whether the minority directors were disinterested or independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.609" offset="13537782">That was the sole scope of the discovery allowed in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.483" offset="13561292">Now, it’s significant to note that the discovery permitted did not include any discovery on the merits, did not include any discovery on the nature and content of the disclosures made to Judge Fuld and I think that’s a significant area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.414" offset="13629001">Because the disinterested minority directors could only act based upon information filtered to them through Judge Fuld through their special counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.565" offset="13673618">The disclosures being made to special counsel with the disclosures of the defendant directors and Anchor Corporation made not under oath but in informal discussions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.460" offset="13721161">Now, I think it was important for the District Judge to have had and he could not have had in this case an indication of whether the full mix of available information was supplied to Judge Fuld and through him to the minority independent directors.</text>

            <text syncTime="4674.182" offset="18800097">I want bring the -- respectfully bring the attention of the Court back to the central issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4680.413" offset="18825070">The Court of Appeals found that as a matter of a law disinterested directors had no power to terminate this stockholders' derivative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.331" offset="18876688">I’ve listened carefully to the discussion this morning and I believe the briefs also support the proposition that no one has cited any authority indicating that the Act expressly deprives this power from the directors, that the history of the Act deprives the directors of this power or that the relevant case law under the Act deprives the directors of this power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4718.940" offset="18979088">Mr. Ferrara has indicated in his brief for the government that the SEC supports the notion that the directors have the power and that the power has not been withdrawn by the Act or what he says is that there should be a remand, but I call to the attention of the Court the final footnote and the brief of the commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="4752.772" offset="19114506">21; Footnote 21 says although we suggest a remand, this Court could determine reasonableness if it wishes because that determination involves only the application of a legal standard to a documentary record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4769.354" offset="19180753">Now, if this Court can determine reasonableness from this record, surely Judge Walker could and we argue implicitly did make a finding of reasonableness, if this Court should find that, that is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4782.825" offset="19234670">Therefore we’ll comeback to the proposition that although we believe that State Law governs and that is the test to be applied, that is to say the test of good faith, no matter which of the tests that have been proposed here we believe that we meet that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="4798.310" offset="19296632">Judge Walker found and I cite this to the Court at 836 that the minority directors carefully evaluated the opinions tendered by both counsels.</text>
            <text syncTime="4811.021" offset="19347414">They considered the merits, they discussed the facts and circumstances surrounding the purchase and retention of the paper and they communicated extensively among themselves before reaching a decision to seek dismissal of this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.476" offset="19409272">I believe that this is precisely the type of directorial conduct that one wishes to encourage.</text>
