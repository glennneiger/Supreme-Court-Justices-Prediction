            <text syncTime="24.014" offset="199450">There are two cases here and the 546, our petition, Number 349 of the Solicitor General's petition, the facts in both cases are quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.390" offset="260890">546 which I will deal with first involve the jurisdiction of the District Court to try this indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.375" offset="308851">And the facts there obviously the indictment itself which charges a member of Congress with taking money and conspiring to take money by introducing bills in Congress, bills which the indictment charges were in fact introduced, and the bills as specifically identified in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.687" offset="402160">It is plain from the face of the indictment that the grand jury which found it heard, considered and relied upon proof of the performance of legislative acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.636" offset="473945">And while it is not clear from the face of the indictment, it is established in the opinion of Judge Meanor and undisputed that's the indicting grand jury, as the grand jury which handed down this indictment received proofs of the performance of legislative act from the United States attorney not from Mr. Helstoski.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.218" offset="580211">It is also clear and undisputed that while Mr. Helstoski gave legislative materials to earlier grand juries, not the indicting grand jury, he had no reason to believe at the time that he gave such materials that he was the target of the grand jury, and in fact somebody else was thereafter indicted, tried and convicted.</text>

            <text syncTime="191.370" offset="868812">Now, our position in 546 is, and you put your finger right on it, that the Court had no jurisdiction to try this indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.187" offset="912071">And if the Court agrees with us and that of course, it doesn't have to reach the evidentiary issues which were involved in 349.</text>

            <text syncTime="260.208" offset="1144247">I must confess that we did not cross-petition on that particular issue, but it may very well be appropriate for the Court to address that question on its own motion because --</text>

            <text syncTime="281.336" offset="1228675">Candidly, I don't think the issue which the Government presented in its petition or even properly before this Court, because the entire factual foundation for the Government's petition in 349 is a series of proposed profers of proof which they asked the District Court to rule upon three times.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.649" offset="1325955">And the District Court refused to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.217" offset="1336195">So there are no facts before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.874" offset="1346853">And 349 is a wholly and an entirely supposititious case.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.046" offset="1371512">And in that respect, I guess I don't have to call to your attention, the attention of the Court, the dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice Blackmun concurred in by the Chief Justice only last week in the (Inaudible) case, which you addressed the question of the proposition that this Court ought -- to be handling supposititious cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.633" offset="1469942">You get enough business handling concrete issues, and while the other seven members of the Court didn't agree that that principle applied to that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.793" offset="1510588">There's no question that this Court ordinarily tries and adjudicates only concrete cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1673.882" offset="6798921">It presents serious questions in our minds as to the continued viability of the Speech or Debate Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.406" offset="6829014">At the outset, I would like to make one point clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.180" offset="6852106">The Congress has read Johnson and Brewster and that Congress accepts Johnson and Brewster.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.328" offset="6884707">When we saw the Solicitor's petition however, and what we viewed as an attempt to relitigate Brewster, we were concerned, and that's why we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.596" offset="6933713">To paraphrase Thomas Jefferson's characterization of the clause which he wrote shortly after the adoption of the constitution, “The clause is intended to protect the substance rather than the shadow of representative government, and for that reason it states for any speech or debate they shall not be questioned in any other place.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.729" offset="7038307">We believe that this clause operates as an institutional protection as well as a personalized privilege.</text>

            <text syncTime="3344.977" offset="13483238">That's a difficult question, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.383" offset="13492955">An order in (Inaudible) which is really what it is, indicating what evidence might or might not be introduce is admissible under some systems or procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.597" offset="13537782">Now whether the federal rules or criminal procedure permit it, I can't direct the Court's attention to a specific provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.093" offset="13571741">But in this case the Court did and the Court had the matter properly before it on the -- on Mr. Helstoski's motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.533" offset="13617507">Then Mr. Helstoski raised several questions about the evidence and the Court in its ruling, in fact in its first ruling, its our ruling, it said that we would have to redact the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.162" offset="13679992">But in a subsequent written opinion it indicated that we didn't have to redact the indictment but that as the Court has already pointed out, we could show evidence of promises to perform future legislative acts, but not past ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.425" offset="13765047">And so we submit that the Court did in fact suppress evidence, and we suggest that although this Court hasn't decided the question, there are a number of decisions in the Courts of Appeals which have done exactly this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.562" offset="13825651">One case that I recall is Batiste versus the United States, in which the Sixth Circuit decided that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.689" offset="13858147">And another one in which the -- this Court denied certiorari, that's United States versus Craig from the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.140" offset="13923976">We suggest that the Speech or Debate Clause creates immunity for a Congressman from civil or criminal liability for his legislative acts and we concede that it shouldn't be construed as narrowly as just a speech or a debate in the Congress, but that it's the kind of act that's generally done in furtherance of a legislative process which certainly doesn't include soliciting a bribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.687" offset="14066082">And so we say that there is an immunity for prosecution for a legislative act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.018" offset="14091473">We further submit that the Court has developed an evidentiary privilege, an implementation of this immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.957" offset="14135150">And as the Court has done with the other privileges, evidentiary privileges that it has created, that we suggest that the shield should not be any roader than is necessary to protect the interest for which it was established.</text>

            <text syncTime="3530.199" offset="14224175">And in this respect of course there isn't any question but that Mr. Helstoski made a gesture before the grand jury of a clean breast of everything.</text>

            <text syncTime="3552.615" offset="14313827">And to permit him to do this and then to assert a privilege would be to make a mockery our off the privilege because he would just have it one way and not both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.855" offset="14366804">And the Court does not permit that in other matters and we see no reason why it should in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.477" offset="14397315">We'd also like to suggest that there's another reason why the district -- why this indictment is good and why the District Court's restriction on evidence should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.210" offset="14472234">We advanced the theory in Brewster that was suggested in Johnson that if there were a narrowly statute, narrowly drawn to achieve the end of regulating the conduct of its business, that the Congress could then involve the executive branch and the judicial branch in it's -- in the discipline of its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.770" offset="14574425">And we suggest that in Section 201 the Congress has done exactly that in its definition of who is an official.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.704" offset="14614235">For the purpose of Section 201, it specifically provides that a member of the Congress is, and then it specifically sets forth the offenses which the defined officials cannot -- I'm -- may, of which they may be found guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.526" offset="14697514">So clearly, this is a statute narrowly drawn to achieve the end of regulating the conduct of its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.442" offset="14733145">And we suggest that there's a good reason for it too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.582" offset="14745684">And my brother who was arguing here a few moments ago suggested or stated in response to a question from the Court that a jury wouldn't be available if a member of the Congress was called on for trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="4385.633" offset="17645902">I want to focus on my case in just a moment and that is the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4392.857" offset="17674846">And particularly on what may be attractive to some of the members of the Court which is, “Well let's just fix up this indictment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.117" offset="17707865">And I simply want to say that the consequence of that is that you remove the effective operation of the Speech and Debate Clause at the point where it's most important namely where it is accusatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4421.100" offset="17787800">Now in Kilbourn against Thompson that used the meaning of the term questioning was not Mr. Justice Stevens' in terms of do you ask a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4432.369" offset="17832835">It is rather, may you make a charge.And I respectfully refer you to Mr. Justice Miller's opinion in which he equates the Speech or Debate Clause the term questioning to the language of the Massachusetts constitution which refers to accusation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4451.390" offset="17908903">If you take that concept and then move over to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question and say, “Is there any case where you set aside an indictment because there's something that happened in the grand jury?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4466.218" offset="17968253">And I say that that's exactly what you do in the immunity type case where a grand jury heard testimony that was barred from him, they shouldn't have heard him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4479.652" offset="18021961">And you say to that prosecutor, “Well if you did it, we cancel that indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4485.518" offset="18045471">If you want to go ahead and not use that prohibited testimony, you're free to do so.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.109" offset="18071803">And that's all we've ever said here, and if the prosecutor should decide not to do that, in any event we said that the Congress has jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4504.732" offset="18122271">And I'm very grateful to you, Your Honor, for indulging me to that extent.</text>
