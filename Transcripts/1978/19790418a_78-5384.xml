            <text syncTime="15.173" offset="164028">The law of this nation has always been at the criminal defendant is entitled to the presumption of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.773" offset="226513">This Court has ruled at the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause protects the criminal defendant against conviction except upon proof of guilt beyond the reasonable doubt as to each fact necessary to constitute the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.430" offset="357125">The Court has further held at the state carrying this burden may not shift the burden to the defendant such as by presumption.</text>

            <text syncTime="85.118" offset="443852">That has not prevented the courts generally from holding that the possession -- evidence of the possession of recently stolen property for example permits a jury to draw the inference that the possessor was also the thief, has it?</text>

            <text syncTime="110.516" offset="545416">No, Mr. Chief Justice, but there is a difference between permitting a jury to infer and telling them that they are to presume or telling them that the law presumes and the difference is critical to the right for trial by jury upon proof beyond the reasonable doubt.</text>

            <text syncTime="142.874" offset="674879">Mr. Boggs, I'm sure that all of us trained as lawyers would probably agree with you that there is a difference between the statement that “you may presume” and “you may infer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="155.938" offset="727124">Do you think the average juror really gets much of a difference between those two sentences?</text>

            <text syncTime="161.339" offset="748753">I think that any juror or literate layperson knows the difference between the word “may” and the word “shall” or the difference between the word “may infer” and the phrase “the law presumes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="180.764" offset="826389">I think they know there is a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.780" offset="838510">They might differ as to exactly how they would describe that difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.154" offset="855960">But in general the difference between those terms would be a difference significant and at the heart of the reasoning process of a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.423" offset="909040">They may infer, allowing them to reason as you were inviting them to reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.321" offset="940701">They shall, or the law presumes phrase prohibiting them from reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.122" offset="983855">Petitioner was charged with the crime deliberate homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.746" offset="1018337">The crime deliberate homicide under Montana law has the element that the defendant shall have caused a death and that he shall have caused that death purposely or knowingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.000" offset="1119378">And the Montana Supreme Court has said that those terms purposely or knowingly embody the concept (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="271.174" offset="1188028">It stood admitted in the case both by written confession and by myself in open court as petitioner's attorney that there had been a doubt that had resulted as a consequence of the acts of petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.882" offset="1330866">I would see no fault with the instruction in a civil case Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.129" offset="1351868">However, I would note that the instruction as given in this case would not conform that the federal rules of evidence pertaining to civil trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.324" offset="1424697">As I read rule 301.2 pertain the civil trials the most that could be instructed under the circumstances of this case was that the jury may infer a presumed fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.794" offset="1494497">But that is strictly aside from the argument that I present to you which is based on this Court's rulings as to criminal trials and proof beyond the reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.993" offset="1567326">The only question in the case if I may say, the reason where the jury is being invited to the courtroom listen to the evidence was to determine the factual question as to the mental state of the petitioner at the time he engaged in the fatal acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.567" offset="1693654">The question of whether he had acted purposely or knowingly was fairly raised by the evidence in the written confession which constituted the state's case together with collaborating evidence while admitting that the death had been caused by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.969" offset="1839208">In no instance states that he intended to kill her, that he wanted to kill her, that he knew that she was dying.</text>

            <text syncTime="453.873" offset="1918830">The facts of the confession stood as the basis for the opinion from a psychiatrist and a psychologist both of whom examined petitioner and informed opinions concerning his personality, his intelligence and informed opinions as to his mental state at the time of the fatal acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.567" offset="2069608">And their opinions offered for the jury's benefit were that he had not intended to cause the death.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.666" offset="2126033">That he did not have the death in his view at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="520.938" offset="2187160">The law presumes that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.539" offset="2213491">What if instead of that the court had instructed, you may infer that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts?</text>

            <text syncTime="544.514" offset="2281409">Let me say in that regard that the instruction was given in addition to the instruction of which I complain which said in its Instruction No. 9 on page 36 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.676" offset="2342118">That purpose and knowledge are manifested by the circumstances connected with the offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1448.937" offset="5899160">Certainly, the State of Montana is not unarmored with this instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.625" offset="5917863">And since the beginnings of this case we have informed the prosecutors of State of Montana not to use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.423" offset="5945031">That's not to say that we do not believe the instruction as used in this particular case that we do believe the instruction used in this particular case is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.616" offset="5985886">We have told the prosecutors not to use it essentially for the problems that are for reason and I call your attention to the main instruction and I believe it's the Kiontees (ph) case of the Fifth Circuit which had a lot of problem, its instruction similar to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.374" offset="6040848">Rather, in trying to draft some kind of instruction that would meet all the different opinions that we receive from all the different circuits, we decided to inform the prosecutors that this instruction probably wasn't needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.832" offset="6086719">And indeed in the key in this particular case our position is essentially that the instruction was superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.571" offset="6109706">Now in Montana, there are essentially three elements of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.437" offset="6133112">Deliberate homicide, one of the elements is that it has to be a voluntary act, and another element is that the defendant had to have caused the death of his victim, and thirdly, the act had to be committed either purposely or knowingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.104" offset="6195806">Now that is in the alternative.</text>

            <text syncTime="1533.604" offset="6237811">If you're going to prove knowingly you can prove that the defendant had a high probability that the acts that he was committing would create in this case death.</text>

            <text syncTime="1872.497" offset="7593357">But as far as the state is concerned that the presumption as it was given in this case had a similar effect to the inference it forms that the fact that it wasn't fully described in any of the other instructions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1904.711" offset="7722193">But obviously in any situation when you're proving an intention, you've got the problem of an inference or presumption because you can't really prove intent by direct evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.583" offset="7793664">Basically, the state is aware of the constitutional questions that are -- that arise here and essentially as we understand the history of this court in the various cases that have been cited in the brief, namely the series of cases, Gainey, Tot, and other cases which relate to specific intent crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.779" offset="7882480">The problem here is whether or not the burden of proof has shifted to the defendant and that the defendant is in a position of having to prove a specific element or disprove a specific element of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.083" offset="7923754">And I think this case relates in that respect to Mullaney but in the Mullaney case, the aspect of malice which was an element of that crime, the aspect of malice was presumed and the defendant was in the position of having to disprove that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.921" offset="7995016">Now on the State of Montana mitigated deliberate homicide has the same elements as deliberate homicide except that it can be mitigated by an affirmative defense of extreme emotional or mental distress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.589" offset="8065755">The presumption in this case and I used the term “loosely” because we're all aware that presumption and inference has had become tremendously confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.632" offset="8097938">I do not agree with the defense counsel that the legal description of a presumption in the State of Montana applies in this case because those instructions were not given to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.143" offset="8143914">So the effect in the presumption -- of the term a person is presumed to intend the ordinary consequences of his act has some other meaning in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.719" offset="8182262">And we're suggesting that the meaning in this case is that the presumption had the effect of an inference, an inference very similar to that of Barnes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2392.007" offset="9671450">Basically, the state is also arguing that the effect of the Instruction No. 5 acting as an inference rather than a presumption that if there was any shifting that was taking place as far as the defendant was concerned that it was a shifting of the burden of production and not the shifting of a burden of persuasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.749" offset="9770402">Although admittedly Montana law suggests that a presumption does not suggest the state that a presumption requires, first it's to overcome that presumption by the preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.702" offset="9814183">In this case, if the -- if that instruction were treated as an inference, the effect according to the ruling by our Montana Supreme Court in this case would be that the defendant would be required to come forward with some evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.136" offset="9859950">Just as in the Barnes case when the inference was used to state that the defendant knew that recently received treasury notes were stolen.</text>

            <text syncTime="2465.462" offset="9965171">But in that case, essentially you're requiring the defendant possibly to testify in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.224" offset="10004250">But that's a very strong inference that you're require him to take upon himself to come forth with some evidence to explain his possession of recently stolen property.</text>
