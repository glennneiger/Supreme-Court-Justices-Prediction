            <label>Mr. Slade Gorton</label>
            <text syncTime="170.809" offset="786578">The crux of our position here again Mr. Justice Stewart is that the District Court's decision mandating a 50% allocation of anadromous fish to treaty Indians is without support either in that treaty language or in the circumstances surrounding the execution of the treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.760" offset="858363">Our view is that the treaty language secured before the Indians, the right to participate in a common fishery from which they might otherwise have been excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.355" offset="892844">In other words, the treaties guaranteed in perpetuity an equal opportunity fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.904" offset="914996">But before discussing that discussion of the treaties, let's reflect for a moment on the actual impact of an equal opportunity fishery on Indians should that be your holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.017" offset="959404">Would such a holding deprive treaty Indian fisherman of a reasonable participation in the fishery, not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.344" offset="988766">The contrary in an equal opportunity fishery, Indian participation will continue to be substantial out of all proportion to their share of the population of the Puget Sound region.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.326" offset="1028681">In fact the percentage of all commercial fishermen who are Indians is likely to continue to increase and for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.194" offset="1064103">First, the state began to limit the number of licenses to engage in commercial salmon fishing five years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.733" offset="1090330">That program has resulted in a reduction in the number of non-Indian commercial fishing licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.827" offset="1114676">Indians on the other hand are not required to obtain state licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.322" offset="1140694">Indians -- in addition to that are not required to pay for those licenses.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="269.677" stopTime="270.125">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

          <turn speaker="slade_gorton" startTime="270.125" stopTime="273.308">
            <label>Mr. Slade Gorton</label>
            <text syncTime="270.125" offset="1183848">Thus the major limitation -- excuse me.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="273.308" stopTime="278.179">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="273.308" offset="1196596">How about the seasons, the season limitations on them and catch limits on Indians?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="slade_gorton" startTime="278.179" stopTime="711.024">
            <label>Mr. Slade Gorton</label>
            <text syncTime="278.179" offset="1216136">That is the -- that's the crux of the case as to whether or not that type of regulation can be imposed to non-Indians equally with others.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.308" offset="1248632">It's clear that they do not require licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.060" offset="1259604">So the major limitation on the number of treaty Indian fisherman at this point leaving aside their catch is their own interest in the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.848" offset="1294712">Second, Indians are not subject to the financial burdens of either state license fees or landing taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.978" offset="1323238">They are nevertheless the beneficiaries of the hatchery programs which are financed by those taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.584" offset="1345703">Third, the Indian capability to fish competitively has been increased greatly by federal and tribal financial assistance in the purchase of sophisticated boats and gear.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.076" offset="1387708">At the same time the state has been buying up and retiring non-Indian boats and licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.166" offset="1416025">The state has also assisted Indian hatchery operations and fish farming enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.161" offset="1435982">Fourth, and we get to the treaty at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.694" offset="1450193">The District Court has determined the and I quote from the treaty, "Usual and accustomed grounds and stations" of the Indians are not restricted to small areas near the reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.437" offset="1501080">For one tribe or another, those grounds include of Puget Sound which you have there on that map.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.558" offset="1525635">All of the United States portion of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and that state's portion of the Pacific Ocean, two-thirds of the way down the coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.874" offset="1558862">In summary, they include all of the states marine waters in the case area together with portions of the Pacific Ocean beyond to the state's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.284" offset="1596479">Every mile of water shown on that map in the United States is a part of the usual in the custom grounds of some Indian tribe under the District Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.615" offset="1641827">And we do not object to that characterization.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.438" offset="1657083">The District Court is its rationale for the 50% plus allocation extracted a part of an 1855 dictionary definition of the word common.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.579" offset="1697729">That rationale has long since been abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.427" offset="1709119">The Ninth Circuit and the respondents have continued the search on successfully for a rational on which they could and will support that rigid allocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.413" offset="1749034">Most of their substitutes in the original decision itself rest on the characterization of the fishing right as tribal rather than as individual.But all references to treaty fishing rights, in every treaty save one.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.316" offset="1808593">Secure those rights specifically to individuals while the other articles of the treaties refer to and to deal with the tribes necessities.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.279" offset="1848508">Governor Stevens of course included the "in common with" language, as a matter of fact the "all of the fishery language in treaty drafts which he presented to the tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.092" offset="1891767">He explained the provision as expressing his view and we quote from some of the treaty minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.425" offset="1913083">He wanted them to fish but that the white should fish also."</text>
            <text syncTime="457.402" offset="1932936">That treaty language does explain, he is apparently the source of the equal protection guarantees for individuals found to be implicit in the treaties by this Court and Puyallup I and Puyallup II.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.355" offset="1988838">The treaties do of course secure certain rights to the Indians not possessed by other citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.245" offset="2016319">They are contained largely in that usual and accustomed grounds and stations clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.666" offset="2038053">Mr. Simmons, an Indian agent present at the negotiations explained to the Indians that and again I quote the minutes, "The privilege was giving -- was given of going wherever they pleased to fish."</text>
            <text syncTime="497.675" offset="2094059">And this Court in its first decision on the treaties, Winans in 1905 distinguished clearly between the right to fish which the Court characterize and I quote as a mere right not exclusive in which citizens might share from what this Court called the "special means for its exercise, the special right is the right of access".</text>
            <text syncTime="522.332" offset="2192697">The state could regulate the right to fish under circumstances which you've set down but it may not exercise the right of access.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.402" offset="2224985">Excuse me, regulate the right of access.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.983" offset="2235329">The fallacy of the 50% plus allocation is perhaps most graphically illustrated by its own logical result.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.271" offset="2268453">There were five treaties affecting the Puget Sound fishery, not one.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.627" offset="2293844">There were scores of quasi sovereign Indian bans on Puget Sound whom Governor Stevens consolidated for treaty purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.966" offset="2327280">But if the treaties mandate a 50% plus allocation at all, the single treaty with the Makahs, the tribe located where the Strait of Juan de Fuca meets the Pacific Ocean would guarantee that tribe of 50% plus allocation of the fish passing through their grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.593" offset="2397706">Next, the grounds of the tribes who would sign to the Treaty of Point No Point, that the point where Puget Sound meets the Strait of Juan de Fuca span the entrance to Lower Puget Sound totally.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.371" offset="2448906">They would thus be best be authorize to take 50% of all of the salmon which could escape the Makahs cutting in half all runs destined further grounds of the Indian beneficiaries of three more treaties farther south on the Sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.672" offset="2506062">By the time the few remaining fish reach the last in line, the Yakamas, theirs is an entitlement to 50% of almost nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.077" offset="2539708">And if non-Indians take their 50% at Point No Point, the lower Sound tribes would have literally nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.998" offset="2567398">After all, if the Indians are entitled to have a 50% return of fish to their normal and accustomed grounds, the articles in the treaty which give them exclusive fishing rights on their reservations must guarantee a 100% return of fish to those reservations and thus leave nothing for anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.361" offset="2656841">Clearly the treaties don't mandate a 50% plus allocation.</text>

            <text syncTime="665.421" offset="2765093">Let's look at the jurisdictional status of Puget Sound in the years surrounding 1850 before the treaties were signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.361" offset="2804799">United States' sovereignty over what is now Washington State was perfected by an 1846 treaty with Great Britain.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.887" offset="2834892">That sovereignty brought with it the common law and the statutes of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.863" offset="2854849">That common law in turn included the concept of a common fishery for the benefit of all except as expressly limited by statute so American citizens had the right to fish in Puget Sound before the execution of the Indian treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.669" offset="2922036">The record reveals that they did fish in Puget Sound then.</text>

            <text syncTime="1341.255" offset="5468348">We simply cannot ban entirely a commercial fishery there and the District Court has permitted Indian fisheries there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.874" offset="5498859">But the state can permit non-Indian fisheries there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1375.024" offset="5603453">So conservation in a marine area in the commercial field has got to include something else than pure escapement for spawning.</text>

            <text syncTime="1594.766" offset="6482422">So in dealing with the right to fish as opposed to the right to access, this Court says in Winans, the Solicitor General points the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.455" offset="6517217">We quote at pages 85 and 86 of our opening brief, the way which the Solicitor General pointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.589" offset="6545742">He said the Indians could be given more advantageous places or advantageous places upstream or downstream from that fish wheel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.923" offset="6587016">This is what the United States does, it manages its ocean fishery primarily for non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.579" offset="6613661">And then says that the state must cut-down non-Indian fishing in Puget Sound to account for all of the fish which Washington citizens have taken under federal licenses in the open ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.345" offset="6664756">And that's the reason for the great disparity in the Puget Sound allocations to Indians and non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.396" offset="6688998">So every one really manages in the way of making that right at -- usual and accustomed stations will by a proper management of the fish and pushing the fisheries out into marine waters or further downstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.877" offset="6750856">Even if -- excuse me, it can't be over emphasized here that the District Court found a permanent and immutable right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1674.328" offset="6800697">The tribes in their amici have attempted to characterize this as a discrimination case and if the sky is the 50% plus allocation is a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.799" offset="6834552">Perhaps the best illustration that's not the case is the IPSFC fishery, the Straits fishery and Canadian fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.695" offset="6862137">That fishery on Canadian bound salmon occurs in the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Northern Puget Sound in the usual and accustomed grounds of fewer than one third of the tribes who are parties to this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.739" offset="6914278">There's no measured -- no significant non-Indian harvest before the fish reach those usual and accustomed grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.853" offset="6942804">Even so, the District Court found that those eight tribes were entitled to 50% of the catch, a right, not a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.131" offset="6975927">We feel that the judgment should be reversed and remanded for determination as to whether or not an equal opportunity -- fishery exists now or if not, how the state can assure it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1827.739" offset="7414366">This case is -- the Attorney General has emphasized involves the question whether or not one group of commercial fishermen, Indians in this case is entitled to a Court awarded perpetual guarantee of a competitive preference over nine Indian competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.700" offset="7486151">The Attorney General has indicated that that result is wrong and we strongly support that aspect of the state's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.711" offset="7514258">Since my time this morning is brief, I must necessarily rely on briefs that I've submitted, the salmon colored opening brief and the yellow reply which discuss not only the substantive points, the historical points, questions of collateral treaties but also some of the procedural obstacles that the United States and the tribes have attempted to erect in order to prevent this Court from resolving what every one conceives of -- as an extremely important legally, practically, emotionally, culturally, politically question that has been plaguing the northwest and will continue to plague the northwest unless it is definitively set to rest by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.000" offset="7687398">There are four major concepts that I would like to emphasize this morning and they all grow out of the same flaw that the federal courts below have manifested in the results that they have reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.074" offset="7739643">And the flaw is a failure to recognize and fully appreciate the significance of the fact that non-Indian commercial fisherman also have rights which a federal court of equity must respect here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.518" offset="7797426">There has been no recognition, no appreciation and no implementation of those rights of the non-Indian commercial fishermen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.047" offset="7831594">First point is that the treaties protect to the non-Indian commercial fishermen a right of access to this fishery as well as a protection of the Indian's right of access to the fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.330" offset="7880704">This was to be a nonexclusive fishery from which neither Indians nor non-Indians could be excluded by the other group.</text>

            <text syncTime="4117.171" offset="16572061">I've had viewed -- that question is foreclosed by the decisions of this Court beginning in Winans where that was very expressly held down to the most recent in Puyallup III in which that same view of the Article III language was taken that it was a reservation of former exclusive rights which the Indians enjoyed, which the tribes enjoyed not a grant by the United States of a fishing right to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="5150.532" offset="20705468">They conceded the right of others to fish them or at worst that ought to be viewed as conceding a half of their previously exclusive fishery.</text>

            <text syncTime="5340.458" offset="21465213">He did suggest and if I can turn to his precise suggestion, they were four fish wheels in the case which monopolized that at least the location was where the wheels were.</text>
            <text syncTime="5359.040" offset="21539506">He says, it sets -- it seems that four wheels in the space of a mile and a half are inordinate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5365.338" offset="21564688">If they ought to be maintained at all, there should be some restriction as to their number and method and daily hours of operation, restriction on the Winan Brothers in order to give the fish and the Indians a chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5379.226" offset="21620276">Certainly the wheels should not be permitted to create and maintain a monopoly until all the fish are gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="5386.690" offset="21650160">One at least of these wheels has been placed at a particular spot which was obviously a most advantageous place for the Indians to fish because there was a great rock there from which their platform or stage in projected so that they could use their deep nets for the longest possible time without being given back -- up the bank, a bluff by rising water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5405.988" offset="21727274">I skipped a little and then -- referring now to the Indians on the other hand, they cannot claim to have an exclusive right and enjoying their right "in common with" citizen and under the modified injunction "in common with" defendants, it may be just to restrict in reasonable ways there times and modes of access to the property and hours for fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5434.562" offset="21841586">It is not fair under the present conditions that they should enjoy without restriction their ancient right of camping and curing in temporary houses on the defendant's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="5445.088" offset="21883695">If it is unfair, a decree can indicate the proper limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5452.268" offset="21912430">It may be that there ought to be some composition of that right or some arrangement by the defendants or the United States or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="5461.655" offset="21949942">That's as far as the suggestion goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5464.316" offset="21960600">But it clearly is a suggestion that fishing at that place ought to be in some manner divided in terms of ours or it would owe us for the Indians to fish, ours for the wheels to offer it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5482.453" offset="22033220">Now we say that that is the most obvious abuse that involved in Winans but to do this, it is equally impermissible to prevent not the Indians from reaching the fishing places but the fish from reaching them which empties the right to fish at those locations of any substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5507.665" offset="22134053">And that is what the structure of the regulations which are -- which had been annulled in this case accomplished to prevent a fair or equal share of the fish which through this funnel of the strait and then the Sound eventually reach the majority of the fishing sites, the traditional sites which are in the Sound, at the mouths of the rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5539.098" offset="22259754">To fish out -- to allow the fishery to be fished out before the fish get to the places is as much a violation of the treaty as to prevent the Indians from reaching it at all.</text>
