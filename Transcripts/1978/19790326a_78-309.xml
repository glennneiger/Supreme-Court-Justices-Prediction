          <turn speaker="arnold_i_roth" startTime="92.083" stopTime="512.586">
            <label>Mr. Arnold I. Roth</label>
            <text syncTime="92.083" offset="471751">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.655" offset="490036">Section 17 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires broker-dealers to make such reports as the SEC may require.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.234" offset="540296">And Section 18 (a) provides an expressed damage remedy to purchasers and sellers of securities who relied upon misstatements in those Section 17 (a) reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.936" offset="611140">The primary issue here is whether in light of the limited expressed damage remedy in Section 18 (a), whether Section 17 (a) itself also provides an additional implied private right of action in favor of costumers of brokerage firms who are not purchasers and sellers against accountants who audit the Section 17 (a) reports that contain the misstatements.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.499" offset="777383">There are also two subsidiary issues here which the Court need reach only if it does find that Section 17 (a) creates an implied private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.271" offset="840495">The first of those subsidiary questions is whether a trustee liquidating the business of a defunct brokerage firm pursuant to the Securities Investors Protection Act of 1970 is entitled to assert the Section 17 (a) rights of action that belong to costumers of the brokerage firm whose property he has been unable to return in the course of the liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.060" offset="971630">The second subsidiary issue is whether costumers of the brokerage firm who have been compensated with money obtained from the Securities Investor Protection Corporation retain any Section 17 (a) rights, and if so is SIPC subrogated to those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.071" offset="1079672">It is the position of petitioner, Touche Ross that there is no implied private right of action under Section 17 (a) in favor of brokerage firm, costumers or anyone else, and that such a right of action would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme, the evident legislative intent and the purposes of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.925" offset="1187088">It is also our position that even if you assume there to be such an implied right of action that neither the trustee nor SIPC may assert that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.964" offset="1255215">Now, this case and those issues arise out off the failure in May of 1973 of a brokerage firm called Weis Securities, and its subsequent liquidation under the Securities Investment Protection Act or SEPA as I will refer to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.910" offset="1342986">Weis at that time was a member the New York Stock Exchange and had approximately 35,000 costumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.429" offset="1377050">In April or May of 1973 the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange learned that officers of Weis had been falsifying the books and financial records of Weis so as to conceal a deteriorating financial condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.975" offset="1459284">The officer's scheme had commenced in early 1972 and had continued on until the spring of 1973, and upon discovery of the scheme in May of '73 upon SIPC's act application, the District Court in the southern district of New York ordered the liquidation of Weis and appointed the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.293" offset="1592508">The liquidation is ongoing and SIPC is said to have advanced $14 million in that liquidation for the purpose of paying off costumer claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.904" offset="1654993">Among the reports falsified by the Weis officers were the Weis financial reports for its fiscal yearend in May 26, 1972, the reports for a yearending about a year before the actual liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.009" offset="1739421">Reports which were filed with the SEC pursuant to Section 17 (a) of the 1934 Act and the implementing regulation Rule 17a-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.461" offset="1789262">Touche Ross, the petitioner here performed the annual audit with respect to those reports, but that audit failed to detect the misstatements in those reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.821" offset="1850702">According to the trustee in SIPC here in this case, Touche Ross failed to detect the misstatement because its audit was conducted in a negligent, reckless, careless, unskilled and grossly negligent manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.370" offset="1936802">It is also asserted that because the misstatements went undetected, the Weis officers were enable to continue until spring of '73 their scheme of concealing the ever increasing losses that were the result of the mismanagement by those officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.840" offset="2038784">SIPC and the trustee also alleged that had Touche Ross discovered the misstatements, effective remedial action could have been taken, the force liquidation avoided or its consequences reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.211" offset="2116211">On the basis of those assertions, SIPC and the trustee commenced two separate lawsuits against Touche Ross.</text>

            <text syncTime="542.962" offset="2275244">Your Honor the District Court had dismissed this action because on the ground that the Section 17 (a) claims of the trustee and SIPC failed to state a claim for relief because Section 17 (a) does not imply remedy for anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.512" offset="2357373">It also dismissed the common law claims for accountant's malpractice and so forth that the trustee and SIPC asserted for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1140.685" offset="4666075">Now Your Honor the question that we have to decide today is whether they ought to have a right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.029" offset="4707453">Now, and I think though that you have to start from the premise that if Congress were worried in 1934 about purchasers and sellers, and we know they were because the '34 Act is filled with purchaser and seller remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.883" offset="4814869">And if they were also concerned at that time as my opponent say with brokerage firm costumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.875" offset="4862830">In fact I want to get to the legislative history that shows you this is not just so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.988" offset="4883310">But the Second Circuit says, “Brokerage firm costumers are the favored wards of Section 17.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.763" offset="4926464">Now if that so, then what you have is the situation where Congress knowing about both of these groups gives the purchasers and sellers an expressed remedy and doesn't give anything to the brokerage firm costumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.376" offset="5016848">So you start almost logically from the proposition that they gave one something they didn't give the other one something and they must have intended not to give it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.035" offset="5075466">Now I think Your Honor that that does bring us to the cases that I say set forth the appropriate analysis for determining whether there ought to be or ought not be a private right of action for these costumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.031" offset="5179538">Those cases are Amtrak, Barbour and Blue Chip Stamps which deals specifically with the question of implying remedies from statutes that already have expressed remedies in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.916" offset="5247039">And of course Amtrak and Barbour hold that the congressional enactment of a limited expressed remedy for violation of a particular statutory provision is probative and compelling evidence of a legislative intent to preclude a broader implied remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.498" offset="5333347">Now the implied remedy that you would get from 17 (a) is broader than the one in 18 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.250" offset="5368351">It is a remedy for costumers, not for purchasers and sellers the typical group of people whom the 1934 Act was to protect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1412.118" offset="5751829">In the legislative history of the 1934 Act, that's where I would like to start, it makes no mention of a private right of action under Section 17 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.102" offset="5815777">It talks only about the administrative enforcement by the SEC and about the SEC going in and inspecting brokers and dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.743" offset="5850363">It does have one revealing thing to it though, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.376" offset="5872828">It does -- there is a statement in the legislative history that makes it clear that the SEC investigations were investigations so that they could go in and get evidence rapidly in any case where fluctuations in the price of a security indicate that manipulation may be in progress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.184" offset="5980139">Now that's the kind of thing that purchasers and sellers are concerned about, and so the only indicia as to who was the special beneficiary of Section 17 (a) in the legislative history of the '34 is that it was purchasers and sellers and not so much the costumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.537" offset="6073553">However, then you come to 1970 when Congress enacted SEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.048" offset="6107512">Now, that legislative history refers to certain protections for costumers or it did not refer to any implied right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.501" offset="6169370">Those protections that it was referring to were the preventive monitoring system that was in its infancy and then was made much broader by SEPA itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.151" offset="6231960">The investigative, injunctive and criminal powers of the SEC to enforce its own rights under Section 17 (a) to enforce compliance by the brokerage industry with 17 (a), and it was talking also about state law the right to go into the state courts and use traditional state law remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.489" offset="6345331">And in fact the House Report refers to some safeguards, however, on both the state and federal levels as well as an industry imposed legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.976" offset="6391306">But the most significant thing is that the Senate Report explicitly stated that brokerage firm costumers in this situation, that Your Honor has referred to, have no remedy available to them under the 1933 and 1934 Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.285" offset="6508544">The Senate Report says, “Apart from the voluntary trust funds, there is no protection presently available under existing securities laws for the investor whose broker goes bankrupt.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.480" offset="6569253">And it also said, “Neither statute prevents the investor from loosing his entire investment if his broker fails.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.727" offset="6614288">A recognition that there were some protection but that the costumer didn't have any -- he didn't have an implied right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.124" offset="6651904">There was nowhere he could go sue for this thing, and here Your Honor, and this is the most -- a most significant thing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.282" offset="6692551">What Congress did was to enact SEPA and to create and to create SIPC with the function not only of being part of the early warning regulatory preventive monitoring system, but with the function of paying off costumers of failed brokerage firms.</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip R. Forlenza</label>
            <text syncTime="2329.051" offset="9419525">Well, on the question of necessity, let me say this, I think that as to the necessary supplement to Commission action which is the phraseology used by this Court in several occasions, there is no question that the Commission nor the exchanges has ever intended to have the resources or ability to conduct the kinds of audits that are required to expose brokers fraud in hiding in that capital violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.585" offset="9521716">The fact of the matter is it's common knowledge, these kinds of audits take hundreds and hundreds of man hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.169" offset="9544077">Now the Commission hasn't got the ability nor the resources to conduct those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.979" offset="9559333">Number two, Mr. Roth talks about the fact that all costumers in this case represented by the trustee who have claims of loses in excess of $1 million, because they were over the limit of the SIPC fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.839" offset="9610742">It is necessary to inquire a private right of action to compensate those costumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.587" offset="9637700">If I may get back to the Section 18 point, my adversary says that the reason for denying the private right of action to costumers not withstanding Section 17, the duty on the accountant set forth there and in the rule is not because of any clear legislative intent, but the maxim of expressio unius and this Court's decision in Amtrak.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.284" offset="9732472">But as Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out, in Amtrak and Barber, there was a statute directly on point giving to a certain party, in that case the Government and a very limited class of private parties, a remedy for the very wrong question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.701" offset="9798196">Here, 18 deals with filed information which has an adverse effect on the price of the security, that is to say fraudulent statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.087" offset="9835708">Section 17 doesn't address that kind of situation when Congress made the contours of a Section 18 claim and made all the sense in the world for the same reasons as Blue Chip, to require a purchase or seller requirement as a limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.476" offset="9901328">No such limitation makes sense in a costumer claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.125" offset="9911881">Indeed it's not a limitation on a remedy, it's a denial of a remedy to costumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.997" offset="9943333">Turning to the intended beneficiaries, Mr. Roth takes issue with the fact that Section 17 has as its intended beneficiaries the costumers and it only point to Sections 8 (b) and 15 (c) 3 of the '34 Act, which are the basis for the net capital rule to point out that Congress was indeed interested in protecting costumers against losses by reason of insolvency of brokerage houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.307" offset="10044583">Section 17 is the only mechanism for finding out about such violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.896" offset="10066944">Secondly, for 35 years, the Commission has interpreted the rule as protecting costumers in justly situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.830" offset="10102680">As recently as January of this year, the Daniels case the Court pointed out that a consistent and long standing interpretation by the Commission is entitled to great weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.571" offset="10137684">In that case, the interpretation is neither long standing nor consistent but that certainly how the case here with Rule 17a-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.428" offset="10173106">Now, as to this legislative intent in 1970 with the enactment of SEPA, if the Court will look closely at the Senate Report, it talked about operational difficulties in the 1960's, the back office problem that gave rise to the demise of most of the brokerage houses at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.081" offset="10247711">They were not talking about situations where accountants had failed to pick up a fraud which exacerbated the situation where the brokerage house resulted in this demise, number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.110" offset="10291806">Number two, the void, unlike the Daniels case, was a lack of insurance, that is to say investor confidence had barely been shaken and implied lawsuits of long duration are hardly the kind of thing that would give investors the confidence they required at that time, SEPA was set up for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.500" offset="10377383">The fact of the matter is Mr. Roth overstates the congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.059" offset="10391594">There's nothing in the legislative history to suggest that SEPA -- excuse me, that Congress even addressed the question of implied rights against accountants.</text>

            <text syncTime="2973.123" offset="11995826">There are costumers with unsatisfied claims in the Weis liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.286" offset="12016515">There are a hundred such costumers and their claims total over $1 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.664" offset="12038040">It is essential that these costumers have a remedy when the scheme provided by Congress for regulating broker dealers, financial condition for the benefit of costumers does not work because of the wrong doing of a third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.897" offset="12107003">Here, the wrong doing is that of the accountants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.608" offset="12121840">We allege in our complaint that the accountants were not only negligent but grossly negligent and reckless in failing to follow Rule 17 (a) and in failing to detect fraud which infected the yearend financial statements filed by Weis with the regulatory authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.331" offset="12200730">Now, it's true as Mr. Roth points out in his brief that many, many other documents, financial documents are filed with the regulatory authorities by brokers in addition to these yearend audited statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.530" offset="12257468">But there are over 5,000 brokerage firms in United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.143" offset="12275963">The SEC which did appear below stated in its brief that it did not have the time or the manpower to conduct its own audits of more than 5% those 5,000 brokerage firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.063" offset="12339597">These other financial information that is furnished to the regulatory authorities is of no value except in so far as it is keyed to the audited statements that are filed annually by the brokerage house.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.854" offset="12402813">As long as the monthly and other data filed by the broker is consistent with the yearend statements, the SEC at where the stock exchanges would ordinarily have no reason to believe that anything was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.512" offset="12469373">Therefore, if the audited financial statements which are considered the barometer of the brokers' financial condition, if they are inaccurate the entire monitoring scheme established by Congress for the benefit of investors in their capacity as costumers cannot work, and there is the risk there will be loss to individual costumers as well as to SIPC which is precisely what occurred in the Weis situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.990" offset="12603329">Now, Mr. Roth accuses us of trying to make accountants scapegoats for every brokerage house liquidation and he suggests that if Congress have wanted there to be a private right of action against accountants, it would've created one in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.290" offset="12668531">Well, no one contends that accountants are the cause of every brokerage house liquidation, the facts here are very unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.478" offset="12705311">They involve, as our complaint alleges, gross negligence in failing to detect fraud, the facts of the Weis liquidation are very unique.</text>

            <text syncTime="3209.079" offset="12939682">The other important limitation on our state court remedy is that according to the accountants, we can not rely even on a state court negligence action on the rules established by the SEC under Section 17 of the Exchange Act, because of Section 27 of the Exchange Act, which says that the jurisdiction of the federal courts over suits in equity and actions at law is exclusive of the jurisdiction of the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.882" offset="13066951">In other words, if our negligence case in state law is to depend, as it would have to depend in large part on violations of specific duties set forth in subparagraph G through I of Rule 17a-5 as it existed in 1973, the accountants say we could not rely on that as a breach of duty under state law and we would be left without a remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3349.191" offset="13500165">Now, state court law on accountants' liability has developed in ways that are divergent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.783" offset="13530467">It's developed in ways that are tied to developments in professional malpractice actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.277" offset="13552515">Generally, those developments have nothing in particular to do with the federal policy of regulating broker dealers for the benefit of their costumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.408" offset="13609044">Mr. Roth says that he is relying primarily on three cases, the Amtrak case, the Barber case and the Blue Chip Stamps case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.629" offset="13649899">In Amtrak and Barber, there was no equivalent of Section 27 of the Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.734" offset="13682291">In addition, if a cause of action have been recognized on behalf of the private plaintiff, in either of those cases, it would not only have been inconsistent with the congressional goals in legislating on behalf of a particular class of people, it would've been antagonistic to those goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.359" offset="13768808">For instance, in Amtrak you could've had a person in one part of the country saying, “Don't cut off my railroad” and filing a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.099" offset="13803813">That might have been in his interest, but it would have been antagonistic to the interests of other railroad passengers or would be railroad passengers in other portions of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.724" offset="13850311">Similarly, in the Barber case where this Court recognized that a private citizen, a costumer of a brokerage house even though the beneficiary of the SEPA Act, should not have standing to invoke the remedies of SEPA, there was a clear antagonism among interest of the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.410" offset="13949053">One costumer might have wanted his brokerage house liquidated immediately, another would prefer that the SEC or the stock exchange undertake the efforts that this Court pointed out those authorities commonly undertake to see if that brokerage house could not be saved and spare any possible loss to costumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.382" offset="14040900">Similarly, in the Piper case where the necessity language was underscored three times on page 25, the question there was a different question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.444" offset="14093145">The question was not whether any private right of action was consistent with congressional goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.695" offset="14118118">The question was whether it was necessary that the particular plaintiff involved there be given a right of action in order to effectuate those goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.181" offset="14168064">In that case, the plaintiff was not a member of the protected class and again there was a possible antagonism between his interest and the interest of the class as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.090" offset="14219682">That was pointed out by Chief Justice Burger on behalf of the Court at page 39 of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.154" offset="14247999">The principles that are applicable here are those of the Borak case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.370" offset="14268897">There are those of Bivens against six unknown narcotics agents, but there are also the principles that have been applied in a well established line of cases in the lower courts under Section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act.</text>
