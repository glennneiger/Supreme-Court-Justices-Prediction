            <text syncTime="1353.401" offset="5516936">In order to focus upon Oklahoma's argument before this Court, I feel it incumbent upon me to bring to the Court's attention the posture of the appellant's argument in the court's decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.363" offset="5572838">The posture of the argument below are the appellant was in the form of distinguishing Geer versus Connecticut from the case of Foster-Fountain Packing Company versus Haydel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.936" offset="5631143">Now as this Court is aware the Geer decision involved wildlife.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.570" offset="5661654">The statute there prohibited the transport of that wildlife across the state line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.787" offset="5694568">In Foster-Fountain Packing Company versus Haydel, this Court looked at the underlying fact situation involved in that case where the Louisiana Statute in the name of conservation prohibited the exportation of shrimp in which the hose and heads had not been removed, thereby requiring their removal in the home state of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.909" offset="5810970">This Court held in that case that the purpose and effect of that statute was economic protectionism for Louisiana residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.482" offset="5861334">That is, that statute favored Louisiana simply because by the very nature of the statute, the packing was required to be done in Louisiana to the exclusion of other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.070" offset="5927685">Now in the lower court as I mentioned, the appellant distinguished Geer versus Connecticut from Foster-Fountain Packing Company versus Haydel and relied up on the Foster case stating that it was applicable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.648" offset="6001977">The posture, however on appeal by the appellant here is that as I read his brief that Geer versus Connecticut is no longer viable when subjected to a Commerce Clause tag.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.753" offset="6074389">It's the view of Oklahoma that the concept in Geer is still viable today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.854" offset="6106781">The concept of the state's interest, the state's interest in controlling its wildlife is as much as alive today as it was in the time when Geer versus Connecticut was rendered.</text>
