            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="71.636" offset="389935">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.191" offset="404146">This case is here on certiorari to the Sixth Circuit that involves the application of the principles for determining the validity under the National Labor Relations Act of rules barring employee union solicitation and literature distribution in hospitals which were enunciated by this Court's decision in Beth Israel Hospital last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.523" offset="509471">The facts are briefly these.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.489" offset="517308">This Baptist Hospital is a nonprofit hospital located in Nashville.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.046" offset="543535">It has 600 patient beds and more than 1,800 employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.763" offset="566418">For a number of years prior to October 1974, the hospital maintained the rule which prohibited anyone to solicit patients or visitors while on hospital premises without written approval of the administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.374" offset="636844">In August of 1974, Congress enacted the Health Care Amendments to the National Labor Relations Act, bringing nonprofit hospitals under the Act's coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.223" offset="684283">In response to these amendments and to the fact that the union had began a campaign to organize the hospitals employees, the hospital after consulting with its lawyers but not with any doctors issued in October 1974 a revised rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.056" offset="779577">The rule provided in pertinent part that no solicitations of any kind including solicitations for union membership will be permitted by employees at anytime including work time and non-work time in any area of the hospital which is accessible to or utilized by the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.557" offset="877589">Solicitation was barred in other areas by employees who were supposed to be working or when conducted in such a way as to interfere with employees who are working.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.684" offset="930147">The effect of this rule is to bar employee solicitation and literature distribution in such public areas as the hospital's cafeteria, gift shop, lobbies, public restrooms, entrances and even the parking lot across the street from the hospital and to confine such activity to nonpublic areas which were not -- or where not all the employees were accessible.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.594" offset="1085733">The Board upon charges filed by the union concluded that the revised rule violated Section 8 (a) (1) of the Act to the extent that it prohibited employees on soliciting the union during their non-work time in areas of the hospital other than the immediate patient care areas, the Board in short followed its decision in Saint John's Hospital that held while a hospital could lawfully bar employee solicitation or literature distribution in immediate patient care areas such as the patient's rooms, operating rooms, and therapy rooms are barred on that activity in other areas was presumptively invalid absent a showing by the hospital that was necessary to avoid disruption of patient care.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.957" offset="1319163">And the Board adopting the findings of the administrative law judge concluded that the hospital had not made that showing of special need here.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.986" offset="1363362">The Sixth Circuit in the decision rendered before this Court's decision in Beth Israel denied enforcement of the Board's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.003" offset="1403382">The Sixth Circuit found that the testimony by the hospital and two doctors as to the necessity for creating and maintaining a tranquil atmosphere throughout the hospital for patients and visitors was sufficient to establish special circumstances that warranted the hospital's restriction of employee solicitation and distribution in these public areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.840" offset="1538696">We submit that the Court of Appeals erred in not applying the principles that this Court enunciated in the Beth Israel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.051" offset="1599613">In Beth Israel, the Court held that the Board's general approach of requiring a health care facilities to permit employee solicitation and distribution during nonworking time in nonworking areas where the hospital had not justified the prohibitions as necessary to avoid disruption of healthcare operations was consistent with the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.020" offset="1715493">And the Court went on to find that the Board had reasonably applied that principle in concluding that the hospital had overstepped the line in prohibiting employee solicitation in its cafeteria which was used primarily by employees but also by patients and visitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.665" offset="1822072">Now, this case differs from Beth Israel in that it involves not only the hospital cafeteria but other public areas accessible to patients and their families.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.461" offset="1873168">In addition, as I indicated, there was a testimony by the hospital administrator and the two of its doctors in an effort to justify the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.031" offset="1935548">Now, let's look at the facts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.090" offset="1947773">A hospital cafeteria here is essentially similar to that in Beth Israel.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.236" offset="1972328">The hospital study of cafeteria usage is not as detailed as it was in Beth Israel.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.846" offset="1998764">However, it shows that the employee usage was nonetheless substantial, 68% on weekdays and at least 47% on weekends, at least of those that went through the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.478" offset="2069295">The percentage of patients in the remaining 32% or 53% of the cafeteria's patrons is not shown by the hospital study but there is testimony in the record to indicate that only a small percentage of the patients used the cafeteria, most of them obtained their meals in their rooms and they can only go down to the cafeteria if they receive special permission to go down there.</text>

            <text syncTime="521.416" offset="2189040">Now, Mr. Come, what significance is your reference to special permission?</text>

            <text syncTime="564.319" offset="2360613">That the use of the -- that the cafeteria, the testimony shows was primarily a place of the employees took their breaks and want to relax and the patient --</text>

            <text syncTime="597.670" offset="2494046">And here, as in Beth Israel, the same fact is present.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.033" offset="2531453">Similarly, the other public areas in which employee solicitation and distribution was barred are areas which the hospital did not consider to be patient care or work areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.142" offset="2587982">There's testimony by the hospital administrator, Dr. Victory to the effect that none of these areas were regarded as a work area or an area of patient care or treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1220.473" offset="4985292">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.872" offset="5002846">To continue with the point that Mr. Come was discussing, it is our understanding that under the Board's present approach, the first inquiry is in -- is whether a particular area is an immediate patient care area or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.216" offset="5108276">Their factual and legal problems in making that determination just as there are in making any other determination and the Board has not yet articulated its approach to solving all the questions and arriving at the lines of demarcation as an appendix to our brief, the blue brief we reprint our submission to the Board in a series of cases which have come back to the Board after Beth Israel, where we discussed an approach to the differing rules that could be applied at page 40 through 42 that could be applied in the different flat functional areas of the hospital if that is the Board's view to the proper approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.930" offset="5403042">But in any rate, corridors are in the case, this case but they're treated under the Board's order only by a distinction between patient care and nonpatient care areas and that has to be made more concrete depending on what happens in this Court in handling the basic question of whether the overall Board approach is right or at least right with regards to areas other than cafeterias.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.795" offset="5582555">I'd like to spend the remainder of my time making three basic points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.690" offset="5614111">The first is that the overall presumption here seems to us to be a common sense way of developing the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.725" offset="5678268">It rests on two basic premises of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.947" offset="5691120">One is that stated by this Court in the Magnavox case in 415 U.S. that the working place or at least nonworking areas of the working place are uniquely appropriate for employee communication that they are presumptively saved to the employees for distribution and solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.793" offset="5790595">And secondly, a point made in numerous labor law cases, most specifically I would think in the Allen case 373 U.S. that the party with the facts and the knowledge is the one who ought to have the burden of proof of demonstrating its position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.994" offset="5875336">And here of course, the hospital position is that patient care would suffer at least in certain regards if solicitation distribution is allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.203" offset="5932178">The hospital claims to have the expertise in -- with regard to these medical questions and it's appropriate it seems to us to put the burden on the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.519" offset="5981497">This is a rebuttable presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.447" offset="5989125">This is not a rule of law that we're discussing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.578" offset="6001664">The Board's position that a broad ban on employee discussion is presumptively unlawful in the hospital can --</text>

            <text syncTime="1606.973" offset="6531218">If you have two bell boys, to use your example, who are taking a break which is permitted to them in a corner of a hospital and one says to the other, we don't have a union here it would be good if we had one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.428" offset="6597047">And they have a quiet conversation in the first -- and the person who to whom that subject is brought says, either that's a good idea or a bad idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.881" offset="6634872">I don't see why -- what employer interest, what hospital interest, what hotel interest ought to say that that is inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.944" offset="6687117">On the other hand, if they are standing at the front desk holding a customer's suitcases and having that conversation with the customer standing there when they are in working time, that's a very different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.093" offset="6755767">So all I was trying to say is that solicitation is the task of normally of discussing and if it happens in an area where such discussions are common, where there is conversation, people walking around, conversing on many different subjects, it's difficult for us to see why off duty employees in a nonworking area should not be permitted to engage in that activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1805.159" offset="7323982">What is union solicitation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.025" offset="7331506">What does it consists of?</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.802" offset="7342582">The medical testimony by and large assumes that union solicitation involves turmoil confusion, loud noises, speeches, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.441" offset="7401096">We think no matter what the basic legal rule is that whether there is a presumption for or against solicitation, the ultimate question ought to be that whatever the ultimate basic point ought to be that whatever standard an employer adopts if it bears more heavily on union solicitation of a kind that I've indicated goes on in this case, then on cognate nonunion activities discussion of other issues which may have just as great in effect on somebody maybe just as likely to result on an argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.996" offset="7579355">Now, my working experience says that the most likely areas for argument are questions of who is going to win the World Series and foreign policy and so on.</text>

            <text syncTime="1964.805" offset="7962624">This is just like Beth Israel where they tell to the people who work at the hospital that if they discuss patient care, they should be careful not to be overheard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2057.172" offset="8332100">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.530" offset="8341504">I think if the Court please, what we have here is an attempt by the Board to establish a rule that arises out of an industrial setting to a hospital situation which simply does not fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.279" offset="8408482">It's quite one thing when you talk about a manufacturing plant where all the employees are involved and another when you talk about a situation where third parties' rights and interests are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.328" offset="8468668">Of course the Board got into that in the Retail Store cases, but here, you have even a further, more direct and important interest involved, it seems to me, and that is the right of the patient, or what the patient can expect when he goes to the hospital sometimes quite ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.319" offset="8548603">And what the patient's attitude is with respect to what's happening to him and those around in the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.654" offset="8577964">So I think the Board in establishing a rule that simply says immediate patient care areas and speaks to such areas such as the operating room, the patient's room and perhaps the X-ray room.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.428" offset="8633135">It's far to a limited rule given a modern day hospital when as this record shows as in Baptist Hospital patients are likely to be all with the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.838" offset="8682768">The patients who are ambulatory, patients who are transported to different places in the hospital, the rule simply doesn't fit in light of the testimony of this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.535" offset="8725504">In Beth Israel, Justice Blackmun expressed this concern in a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.295" offset="8756537">I fear that this unusual case will be deemed to be an example for all hospital eating facility cases and that the Board and the courts now will go further down the open solicitation rule than they would have done had a more usual hospital case than the first one to come here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.719" offset="8838248">Justice Brennan in writing the majority opinion advised the Board to follow the cases and the hospital cases as it came before them not to take Beth Israel as a standard, it necessarily was to be applied in all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.818" offset="8906689">And I think what we have is the Board taking its rule as enunciated in St. John's Hospital and which form the foundation for Beth Israel which this Court decided earlier on a completely and vastly different record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.691" offset="8966144">It's taking its rule in St. John's has applied it again in this case without even a discussion of the record evidence in his decision than on a basis of a footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.367" offset="9016822">But we're following St. John in a footnote, so what we have first of all it seems to me is a Board establishing a rule that rises primarily out of an industrial situation, a manufacturing plant, attempting to transpose it with some modern modification to a hospital with immediate patient care areas and it simply will not fit for a hospital such as Baptist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.986" offset="9131342">First of all, I like to point out that there were substantial differences in the record evidence in this case that was presented this Court in the Beth Israel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.687" offset="9170108">Justice Blackmun anticipated that this -- Justice Powell in his concurring opinion anticipated that this might very well arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.024" offset="9207515">Some of the things that are substantially different it seems to me is in a much greater showing in this case that there was public use, visitors and relatives in the Baptist Hospital cafeteria and I suppose along with that non-employees are perhaps patients, it doesn't show.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.894" offset="9290898">But it does show that about 32% of the patrons in the cafeteria during weekdays were visitors or were nonemployees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.317" offset="9328619">It could've been patients and visitors, I suppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.440" offset="9345128">About 53% or a majority on the weekends were not employees in the cafeteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.971" offset="9371251">In the medical testimony, the unrefuted, uncontradicted testimony was that it has anything unsettling that occurs, circumstances that occur to a relative of the patient is inevitably rubs off from the patient and could certainly affect the recovery or the progress of the patient with respect to the treatment he was receiving at the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.252" offset="9460381">So you have contrasted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.690" offset="9470098">As one of the members of the Court said I believe in Beth Israel what seems to be a typically employee-oriented cafeteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.489" offset="9501341">That's not the record in Baptist Hospital where certainly on weekends, a majority at least according to the surveyor, it was a limited survey according to the record shows that majority of the people visiting the cafeteria over weekends were nonemployees, are visitors to the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.090" offset="9587754">One point I would like to make further and if you read this record, all through it, the medical experts, the doctors, treated the hospital as a whole, as a patient care area, those area of the hospital where the patients were likely to be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.165" offset="9660061">They did not distinguish between the operating room or the patient's room or the gift shop where patients visit to get a newspaper or perhaps cigarettes or some other reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.348" offset="9708753">Those doctors did not distinguish between these areas and immediate patient care areas as the Board has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.519" offset="9745429">Another thing that was so vastly different about Beth Israel and is not true in this case, the record evidence in that case showed that the hospital itself, apparently because there were only about 9% -- the business of that cafeteria were 9% of the visitors had used it for, had allowed individual one on one solicitation prior to this case arise, it had used it for the types of solicitation for charities, various types of charities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.807" offset="9874578">It had established a table and display rack for brochures and other important, other employee information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.503" offset="9905403">That's not true in Baptist Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.737" offset="9914284">This record shows that this rule had been imposed for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.624" offset="9933824">They had not allowed solicitation in the cafeteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.596" offset="9945736">It even shows that Mr. Victory, I believe it was his testimony that one employee attempting to sell Avon products in the cafeteria was disallowed prior, long before this case arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.601" offset="9993801">It's been a consistent rule consistently applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="3194.047" offset="12879600">I urge the Court again that the court below reviewed the record and found that in so far as the Board had concluded that the hospital here showed special circumstances that the Board limited those special circumstances to the immediate patient care area, the court below specifically found that is not the evidence in this record, and so there was no justification for the Board concluding in the fact of this case that it should be limited to “immediate patient-care areas” and I ask this Court to affirm the decision of the court below which I believe to be correct, Your Honor.</text>
