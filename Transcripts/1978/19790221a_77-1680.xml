            <text syncTime="20.287" offset="184508">Before I discuss the question of the constitutionality of the Detroit Stop and Identify ordinance I would first like to discuss whether the constitutionality of that ordinance is necessarily relevant to the ultimate issue in this case and that is whether or not the Phencyclidine seized from respondent is admissible against him in a trial for possession of phencyclidine and the facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.231" offset="280325">On September 14th, 1976 at approximately 10:00 PM two Detroit police officers answered a radio run to investigate a complaint regarding two persons drunk in an alley by a garage.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.269" offset="332466">As they pulled their scout car into the alley and questioned they observed respondent and a woman who was in the process of talking her pants down.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.634" offset="365902">They drove on into the alley and while seated in the scout car directed questions to these persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.369" offset="388890">The woman stated that she had to go to the bathroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.382" offset="404877">Respondent was asked for identification and stated that he was Sergeant Mash.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.442" offset="425148">He was asked for his badge number and he gave a number.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.697" offset="438209">He was again asked for identification and this time he stated that he worked for Sergeant Mash.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.529" offset="457540">At this point the female approached the scout car and she was asked for identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.216" offset="476244">Her response was to dump the contents of her wallet through the open police car window on to the lap of the officer who was seated inside.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.931" offset="511143">She was then arrested for disorderly conduct because of her intoxicated condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.493" offset="533295">The respondent was arrested for a violation of the Detroit ordinance for refusing to identify himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.955" offset="559208">He was searched and on his possession a quantity of Marijuana was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.982" offset="575300">Also taken from him was a package of cigarettes and in that package the officer observed a tin foil packet.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.434" offset="601109">That packet was ultimately determined to contain a quantity of Phencyclidine and it was for possession of phencyclidine that respondent was ultimately charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.257" offset="636426">He was bound over for trial in Detroit Recorder's Court and a motion to quash the information was brought before the 12 judge and denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.343" offset="668714">The Michigan Court of Appeals granted an interlocutory appeal and ordered that the information bequest and the case dismissed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1292.116" offset="5271803">We submit that it would not result in lawless police conduct, but in police continuing to do their duty to enforce the violation of ordinance when they occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.606" offset="5305762">If anything it would deter a police officers to not act as courts reviewing legislation before they decide whether or not to enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.370" offset="5336900">Now if the rule were to be applied to these facts, what would it mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.018" offset="5355395">I believe that hopefully its application should not and would not alter future police behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.846" offset="5378800">For the police did that which we would expect him to do and which we want them to do in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.284" offset="5396459">As Mr. Justice White stated in his dissent in Stone versus Powell, that excluding the evidence in these sorts of circumstances can no way affect future police conduct unless it is to make the officer less willing to do his duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.588" offset="5445674">Now this court and I think wisely so and legislatures also wanted to maximize control of the police officers, to reduce as low as possible their area of discretion without keeping them from operating at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.120" offset="5499904">We want suicidal control of their actions, but the exclusionary rule was applied in the case, exactly the opposite affect would occur than the exclusionary rule seeks to achieve for the officers would then have unbridled discretion to decide what laws they are going to enforce before they enforce them and I don't think that is a result once the exclusionary rule is attended to accomplish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.423" offset="5577017">If then there is no affect on future police behavior, if there is no removal of any inducement to violate the Fourth Amendment and I submit plainly there would be no removal of any inducement in this case, in suppressing the truth in the criminal proceeding will occur and nothing will have been gained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.188" offset="5640129">I would also like to briefly point to the argument from judicial integrity on which I believe respondent heavily relies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.596" offset="5665729">This court has already held that judicial integrity is not offended if law enforcement officials reasonably believe in good faith that their conduct is in accordance with the law, the time they act even if subsequent decisions hold that their conduct was not permitted under the constitution and here the police acted as we would want them to act when a violation of the law occurs in their presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.474" offset="5749217">Since the trial and is a search for truth, to exclude the truth in the absence of an insolent use of police authority, in the absence of achievement of any affect on future police behavior, I submit as itself in front to judicial integrity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.574" offset="5809716">And we have for the purposes of argument here, assume that the ordinance is unconstitutional but as I've indicated on the merits we do not concede that that ordnance is unconstitutional and I would point out that I believe looking at the revision only for clarification purposes that it does, the ordinance has three parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.381" offset="5876903">There is the stop portion which I have discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.709" offset="5886203">There is a substantive offence portion which makes it a crime to refuse to identify oneself and also makes it a crime to refuse to provide verifiable proof written or oral of that identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.201" offset="5924133">The inability portion of the statute, which Justice Stevens referred to I believe is separate from the criminal portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.893" offset="5946911">For person rather than refusing to identify himself is unable somehow to provide verifiable proof, he maybe detained into as identification is verified and then he is to be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.397" offset="5988916">This portion of the ordinance is very similar to the Uniform Arrest Act, which is cited in our brief which allows two hour detention to similar circumstances and I believe that portion is not a issue in this case, this is not an inability to indentify this is a refusal to indentify case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.172" offset="6044087">Now the key question it seems to me is whether or not the government can make this conduct criminal, refusal to identify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.617" offset="6065821">I have already stated that I do not believe there is a Fifth Amendment problem, I think the key question is whether or not any right of the respondent is violated by the government making this conduct criminal and the only one that I can, that comes to mind is possibly a claim of an interference with the Right to Privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.081" offset="6151711">It is our position that there is a governmental interest served in allowing and making this conduct criminal and I think this is a Fourteenth Amendment due process question--</text>

            <text syncTime="1945.441" offset="7885093">We would submit that the statement of facts which Mr. Baughman has presented to the court while those statements can be interpreted from the facts it can be interpreted from the some what sketchy record before us that Mr. DeFillippo did indeed attempt to identify himself and I would like to clarify that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.721" offset="7970252">Certainly Mr. DeFillippo in a city, the size of a City of Detroit would not know the police officer personally.</text>

            <text syncTime="1996.054" offset="8087594">Now Gary DeFillippo allegedly talked about the subject of a Sergeant Mash.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.481" offset="8113298">The question I think that remains unresolved is what did Gary DeFillippo actually say, I don't think that that has ever been clarified because the police officer perceived at first Mr. DeFillippo to say I am Sergeant Mash, the police officer admitted subsequently that Mr. DeFillippo may well have said to him, I work for Sergeant Mash or I know Sergeant Mash.</text>

            <text syncTime="2274.561" offset="9201664">And it has not yet this morning been discussed the problem of the particular vagueness of the ordinance in question which is what I would like to turn to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.373" offset="9248893">The Michigan Court of Appeals, while they did find that the statute was perhaps overbroad and then use the terminology that the statute, the ordinance made criminal what was otherwise innocent conduct, I don't believe and I would agree with Mr. Baughman that that in and of itself would not be a sufficient reason to strike down the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.122" offset="9331858">However, we would submit that when a statute takes very presumptively innocent conduct such as a person walking from his own home to go up to the corner to buy a newspaper, that when a statute can make that conduct potentially illegal it must do so in terms which are clear, in terms in which the ordinary man of average intelligence will have no difficulty understanding and we submit that the Detroit common counsel in August of 1976 in passing this particular ordinance did not set any such standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.461" offset="9489220">The standard in the ordinance itself uses the term identification without any explanation of what will be sufficient or what will be reasonable identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.406" offset="9533001">I would submit that there are many citizens in the city of Detroit who by their age or by their lack of a particular occupation are going to be unable to have a really much of any identification at all.</text>
