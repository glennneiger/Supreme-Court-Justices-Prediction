            <text syncTime="46.534" offset="289520">Mr. Brackett, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="j_steven_brackett" startTime="51.296" stopTime="583.999">
            <label>Mr. J. Steven Brackett</label>
            <text syncTime="51.296" offset="308537">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.134" offset="319927">This case arose as a controversy between a mortgagee and the bankrupt estate as to whether or not the mortgagee of the bankrupt estate was entitled to rent realized for mortgaged property between the time of the mortgagor's bankruptcy and the sale of this property pursuant to an order of bankruptcy court.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.981" offset="415326">I think it's necessary preliminarily that we discuss some of the facts in this case as I relate to the North Carolina law and if the Court will indulge me I would like to discuss these facts in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.581" offset="457644">This case began as a Chapter XI proceeding, that is a plan of arrangement under the Bankruptcy Act wherein the bankrupt estate in this case owned tracts of real estate as well as personal property which was sold as merchandise in a retail business.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.502" offset="525354">Only at real estate owned by the bankrupt estate there existed a first deed of trust and also a second deed of trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.434" offset="561089">During the period of arrangement after the commitment of the Chapter XI proceeding work was done and performed at the instruction of the bankruptcy court by various attorneys, certified public accountants and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.145" offset="615946">There was about $800,000 worth of personal property which was inventory of the bankrupt estate which was disposed off during this period of arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.969" offset="655235">No proceeds were deducted from the sale of this personal property in inventory to be applied to at the cost of administrating a bankruptcy estate or as payments for any of the attorneys, accountants and various other employees engaged by the bankrupt estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.692" offset="722108">During the period of bankruptcy some one year after the bankruptcy had been initiated, the second holders of deeds of trust in the property perceived that the bankrupt estate under its plan for arrangement was not able to keep current the first deeds of trust or the first security on the real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.301" offset="808626">Therefore, these first and second mortgage holders through the bankrupt debtors attorney sought the appointment of a receiver who was to receive and collect all income produced by the estate that is the rental income from the real estate and apply that pursuant to the order of the bankruptcy court to federal and state income taxes, to the monthly mortgage payments due to the first mortgagors, to the ad valorem taxes, the payment of fire insurance and to the interest and principal payments due to the second mortgage holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.699" offset="942164">There was also within a period of a few months later a standby trustee appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.645" offset="969958">This stand by trustee is the trustee defendant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.507" offset="985422">Also, at the time this receiver was appointed for the collection of the rents, the bankruptcy court specifically ordered that the second secured parties in the real estate not attempt in any way to petition or foreclose their property in the state courts without the specific permission of the bankruptcy court.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.436" offset="1081135">This of course was in addition to the general stay order that is executed against the creditors when the bankruptcy proceeding is initiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.246" offset="1116348">Because of default by several of the bankrupt -- the debtor in possessions creditors that is several tenants on their real estate and the mortgage -- in the rental payments, the tenant and other financial reversals there was not sufficient cash flow being generated by the debtor in possession to comply with the bankruptcy, with the bankruptcy judge's order regarding payment of the various four payments that I previously mentioned to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.994" offset="1227316">Therefore, this petitioner who is here before you today filed an application with the bankruptcy court on the 30th day of December 1974 to have one of three acts performed by the bankruptcy court.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.493" offset="1285308">That is to convert the Chapter XI proceeding, that is the plan of arrangement to a liquidating bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.456" offset="1313207">Two; to remove the stay outstanding against these second deeds of trust holders in order that they can pursue their state remedies under the state law of North Carolina or three to convert the proceeding from a Chapter XI to a Chapter X proceeding under the Bankruptcy Rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.665" offset="1386036">At this time, the second deeds of trust outstanding to the petitioner in this case were not in default.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.582" offset="1417697">They were paid current.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.324" offset="1424697">On the 14th day of February, 1975, the bankrupt, that is the debtor possession was adjudged to be a bankrupt was adjudged bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.725" offset="1462314">A trustee was appointed that is the trustee who is defendant in this case, was appointed to proceed with the bankruptcy proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.107" offset="1491780">He was ordered in that -- in his order -- in the order appointing him as trustee to collect and receive all rents, issue, income and profits and to hold and retain all moneys and profits received to the end that the same may be applied under this or different or further orders of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.181" offset="1572133">On April the 16th of 1975 some two months after the trustees' appointment, there was a first meeting of creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.174" offset="1604106">It was suggested that at this time by the trustee as well as your petitioner in this case, who was a second mortgage holder that there was no equity in the property and that the property should be conveyed, not abandoned, but conveyed to the second mortgage holders in order that they could workout arrangements with their first security holders under the real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.866" offset="1694804">At this time, the bankruptcy court in its hearing as documented in the appendix in this record suggested that there were substantial amount of administration cost of bankruptcy which had accrued during the period of the arrangement and was curious as to what source would produce the moneys to satisfy these costs of administration and indicated also that the economic conditions were bad at that time and perhaps that would improve within the next several months and indicated therefore to the second mortgage holder and to the trustee that he was not inclined to convey the property to the second secured parties in the real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.564" offset="1861674">Thereafter, the property was sold pursuant to the order of the bankruptcy judge late in July of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.960" offset="1891244">At the time of the sale which was a public sale after due notice there was a substantial deficiency that is in about and sum of approximately $213,400, that is that the second deeds of trust holders were without their security to that extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.135" offset="1963865">The petitioners in this case again approached the bankruptcy court, moved that the bankruptcy court not confirm the sale and that they abandoned the property to the bank -- to the second secured holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.075" offset="2015692">The bankruptcy court declined this.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.004" offset="2027395">The petitioner in this case appealed to the District Court, and the District Court remanded to the bankruptcy court with the instruction that the bankruptcy court order the property sold again with the petitioners that is the second mortgage holders being allowed to use the credit due them on their deeds of trust to the extent of $360,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.567" offset="2117674">Under these conditions your petitioner in this case purchased the property having a deficiency owned under his debt of $186,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.226" offset="2156231">Thereafter the trustee in this case drew a deed conveying all four tracts of property to the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.595" offset="2185801">The trustee also had that deed recorded and delivered it to the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.081" offset="2215685">Soon after the petitioner made claim for disbursement of the funds on hand, some $160,000 plus accrued interest which were collected by the trustee as a rental on the property it which had said the petitioner held a security interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.817" offset="2278588">The bankruptcy judge held a hearing regarding this and found that the petitioner in this case was an unsecured creditor to the extent of $186,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.278" offset="2324459">And this ruling, petitioner appealed to the District Court and District Court reversed the finding of the bankruptcy judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.472" offset="2357269">This order was appealed to the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.259" offset="2368449">The Fourth Circuit reversed the District Court's order determining that the petitioner in this case had not complied with the state law of North Carolina in seeking to sequester and have these rentals set aside and help for his benefit and therefore declaring him to be an unsecured creditor.</text>

            <text syncTime="601.051" offset="2507525">I don't -- in my opinion I don't see the bearing of passages of the new Bankruptcy Act on this case other than perhaps Paragraph 57 (H), which has been cited by the government in their brief here.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.973" offset="2571264">That might have some bearing and also I think we need to have a resolution of the diversion between the circuits here in order that the secured creditors can know what their standing is and what is going to be required of them to protect their interest when their moneys are in the hands of a trustee.</text>

            <text syncTime="631.493" offset="2629360">Well, if it does have a bearing it may make this case a lot less important than it might otherwise be.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.548" offset="2649527">Let me leave just one provision?</text>
            <text syncTime="638.850" offset="2658722">The commencement of a case creates an estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.268" offset="2672410">Such estate is comprised of the following property; proceeds, product, offspring and rents which would cut against you?</text>

            <text syncTime="654.312" offset="2720580">To that extent again reiterate to His Honor that to the extent of the new Bankruptcy Act, we are not that familiar with the proposed new Bankruptcy Act to the extent that this effects or the new draft of the Bankruptcy Act would affect the rights of secured debtors then yes, this case is of extreme importance to the drafters in new Bankruptcy Act to this Court in considering this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="703.125" offset="2915871">I think it's a perception of the various circuits as to what bankruptcy is.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.717" offset="2938232">Apparently the Third and Seventh circuits perceived bankruptcy to be an equitable remedy and therefore the Third and Seventh circuits tend to apply equitable principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.199" offset="2984208">The remaining, the Second, Eighth and Ninth Circuit, I think if the circuits are involved here in these particular cases follow the principle that so far a state law is not in conflict with the federal bankruptcy law, they are going to apply the state law in recognition of the secured creditors rights only being consistent with those product real estate that is located in their states.</text>

            <text syncTime="770.688" offset="3186082">As a matter of fact they have adhered to that principle.</text>

            <text syncTime="779.559" offset="3221608">Skillful drafting of the mortgage agreement would be the first step that mortgagor would have him protect himself, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.284" offset="3252537">As I have attempted to point out to the court, there is a split among the circuits and that the circuits that follow the so called equitable Rule would be the Third and Seventh Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.739" offset="3290363">This case was the case, the principle case set out there as the Bindseil v. Liberty Trust Co.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.092" offset="3311783">This case says that in essence that bankruptcy interferes with state remedies to such an extent that a debtor or a creditor is prohibited from exercising certain rights that he might have under state law and in cases such as this where equitable principles would allow the bankruptcy court will allow his lien to the extent that it is deficiency to follow the rentals that are turned over to the hands of a trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.572" offset="3461622">The remaining circuits, that is the Second Eighth and Ninth Circuits adhere to the Rule that they will follow the state law and that law is to be applied carefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.446" offset="3501119">Under either comprehension of the law, we suggest that the petitioner has complied with under the diversion of both circuits and in any event in this case the petitioner should be granted a security interest in these rents and the primary basis for this is the cases Parker Co. versus Commercial Bank of High Point.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.348" offset="3604773">This is cited in 204 North Carolina 432.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.986" offset="3619297">We contend this is the law in the state of North Carolina and that the Fourth Circuit failed to properly address itself to this case in determining that the bank or that the petitioner in this case had not complied with the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.260" offset="3680423">In the Parker case, there was a judgment creditor that is a creditor who had pursued his remedy to a judgment, it was outstanding mortgage held by a first deed of trust against an automobile company or motor company.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.781" offset="3742490">The mortgagor under the deed of trust began, initiated a foreclosure proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.849" offset="3762761">The judge Macdader (ph) in that case filed an action to enjoin the foreclosure proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.568" offset="3793690">Rents were accumulated while this action was pending in the courts of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.461" offset="3821171">Subsequently the mortgage holder obtained a deficiency judgment and reduced it to judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.299" offset="3852518">The judge Macdader (ph) who had initiated the action to enjoin the foreclosure had had a receiver appointed who collected these rents.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.862" offset="3898807">The court held that the mortgage creditor was entitled to satisfy his deficiency judgment from the funds collected by the receiver during the pendency of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.397" offset="3960978">We contend that this case is directly analogous to the case before the Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.233" offset="3984280">The opposition would contend that we have failed to take steps as required in the North Carolina state law to protect ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.132" offset="4023881">Citing the case of Greg versus Williams which places North Carolina in alignment with the majority of states in this country that require that a mortgagee in order to assert a security interest in the real estate, in the rentals collected, take some into which substitutes for taking possession of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.344" offset="4120743">That is ordinarily the mortgagee would have to take possession of the property and these courts have held that where taking of the property is not possible as in a bankruptcy case, the mortgagee must take some other action to perfect his security interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.499" offset="4185318">That is he must seek to have the rental sequester or seek to have a receiver appointed in the bankruptcy proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1732.047" offset="7031515">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.391" offset="7048965">I think it's fair to say that all sides agree that this case has not answered the issue in this case, is not answered by the Bankruptcy Act as such and if I may refer to a question that Mr. Justice Blackmun posed earlier, I think that the new Bankruptcy Act will not be anymore helpful than the old one was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.696" offset="7130154">I don't think the new Bankruptcy Act will answer this question anymore clearly than it is answered now so that although rents specifically are mentioned, the question is whether the mortgage interest overrides that right to rents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.042" offset="7211551">I think it's also fair to say that all sides agree in this case that had Golden Enterprises not gone into bankruptcy, the petitioner as mortgagee would have had no right under North Carolina law to the rents unless and until he instituted a foreclosure action and obtained the appointment of a receiver to collect the rents for him and where we part company in this case is that the petitioner says that bankruptcy makes all the difference after that fact and we say it really makes no difference at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.846" offset="7338715">Specifically we recognize that once the property here came under the aegis of the bankruptcy court, which in this case was when the Chapter XI petitioner's filed, the petitioner was no longer free to begin foreclosure and seek the appointment of a receiver without the permission of the bankruptcy court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.310" offset="7408619">The petitioner argues that from that fact alone he was entitled to the rents as an equitable matter and we believe on the other hand that just as the petitioner would have been required under state law to take some affirmative step to reach the rents in the absence of bankruptcy so he should be required to take some affirmative step to reach them once bankruptcy occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.730" offset="7498271">Although foreclosure in the State Court and appointment of receiver in a State Court were barred to him, other steps were not as I will discuss in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.682" offset="7546128">The petitioner argues and he places a great deal of emphasis on this that even if we are correct in that reading of North Carolina law and I don't understand him to disagree with us on that, he did pursue an alternate course sufficient to protect his interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.674" offset="7606105">We believe the Court of Appeals was correct in holding that he did not do so, And finally we believe that even if the minority view of the circuits and the view of the petitioner is correct that equity should prevail the facts of this case demonstrate that petitioner has suffered no loss looking at the transaction as a whole and therefore that equity should not require that the rents be handed to him in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.707" offset="7698160">But let me return to my first and most important point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.637" offset="7717909">As this Court has recognized in a series of cases, the nature and extent of a creditor security interest in the property of bankrupt is the matter of State and not Federal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.695" offset="7762108">Congress presumably could make it otherwise in its exercise of its powers under the bankruptcy clause, but it has not done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.967" offset="7791261">In this respect it has chosen to differ to state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.332" offset="7808711">Under North Carolina Law, if petitioner wished to reach the rents of the property by virtue of his security interest he would have to go to court and request that a receiver be appointed for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.077" offset="7855731">Such a remedy is provided in North Carolina Law as a part of a foreclosure action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.597" offset="7881749">As I say we recognize that in this case that precise step was not open to him, but we do not believe that by that fact he could vindicate his claim by doing nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.199" offset="7932217">That is essentially what he is arguing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.999" offset="7939323">He is saying since I could not go to State Court I ought to have the rents as a matter of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.887" offset="7966908">We believe that if he wished to reach the rents that he was obliged to take some action in the bankruptcy court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.823" offset="8002644">As far as what the North Carolina law is before I leave that, I don't think there is any dispute and I don't think there is any need for this Court to resolve conflicting views of what the law is in North Carolina because the petitioner has said that the Parker case which we cite in our brief is the best case on what the North Carolina law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.014" offset="8087385">We agree with that and we think that Parker case states the law quite succinctly and I would think that if the Court refers to that case, it will have all the North Carolina law needs to decide this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.610" offset="8149765">That the my opponent did not quote the whole holding of that case and I will only point out to the Court that the Parker case says “ordinarily a mortgagee or a creditor secured by a deed of trust has no right to collect the rents or other income from property even after default in the payment of secured indebtedness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.279" offset="8256449">This right arises only after the mortgagee or trusty has taken possession of the property conveyed by consent or pursuant to an order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.281" offset="8304515">But where as in the instant case says the court a receiver appointed by the court in a foreclosure action has taken possession of the property and collected the rents, then the rents should be applied as payment on the secured indebtedness.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.141" offset="8359894">And we have no problem with that holding at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.473" offset="8377240">What --</text>

            <text syncTime="2089.105" offset="8459786">In this case no Mr. Justice Steven it does not and the reason it does not is because that request was made during the arrangement proceedings of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.224" offset="8500224">In the first place I would not agree that it was a receiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.699" offset="8510151">It was not a receiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.650" offset="8514017">It was an agent that was appointed but even assuming that it was a receiver, Rule 201 of the Bankruptcy Rules provides that when a trustee is appointed in a liquidating bankruptcy the receivership is terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.465" offset="8569187">So even if there was a receiver appointed during the Chapter XI phase of that case that phase was ended and that receivership was terminated by the appointment actually by the qualification of the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.021" offset="8623417">Not only that, but the trustee and this is why this is a matter of substance and not simply form, the trustee received completely separate and distinct set of marching orders from that had been applied to this agent or receiver or whatever he is called because the agent or receiver was told to pay, to apply the rents in a certain specified priority; taxes, fire insurance so on and so forth with the second mortgagee on the bottom of the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.251" offset="8744417">The trustee on the other hand was told not to pay any expenses, but to simply accumulate the rents produced by the property until further order of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.808" offset="8786631">So by reason first of all of Rule 201 of the Bankruptcy Rules and secondly by the fact that the trustee was given a totally different set of instructions from that received by the receiver in this case we say that action was simply insufficient to govern the rents from the time of bankruptcy until the time that the mortgagee took possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.025" offset="8891434">That's the time period we are looking at this case, it opens with the adjudication of the bankruptcy, it closes when the.</text>

            <text syncTime="2313.082" offset="9355682">Rule 701 provides for adversary proceedings “to determine the validity, priority or extent of a lien or other interest in property.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.322" offset="9396642">Petitioner could have filed an adversary proceeding claiming that his mortgage extended to an interest in the rents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.647" offset="9421928">Under Rule 765 of the Bankruptcy Rules which adopts Rule 65 of the Federal Rules, the Court could have ordered the trustee not to commit the funds pending an adjudication although in fact this is what the Bankruptcy Court had told the trustee anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.450" offset="9489220">And then if petitioner had prevailed in this adversary proceeding the Bankruptcy Court could have entered an order of sequestration or attachment, telling the trustee to pay the rents over to the mortgagee or as a second course of action the petitioner could have gone in under Rule 601 (C) of the Bankruptcy Rules and ask for relief from the stay of state court proceedings which Rule 601 imposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.877" offset="9602905">The Rule 601 says you will not enforce any action against the property in a state court, but there is a provision, Section C of that Rule, that says on application of any party or any creditor the state Bankruptcy Court may lift the stay and permit the creditor to go to state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.258" offset="9680436">So he could have done either one of those two things.</text>

            <text syncTime="2523.299" offset="10196616">I think there are two reasons that we are asking that the Court require the petitioner to take some action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.681" offset="10226082">In the first place it is not the scheme of the Bankruptcy Act, it is not the intend of Congress to give the creditor any enhancement of the remedies he otherwise would have merely by virtue of the fact that his debtor is in Bankruptcy Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.574" offset="10297657">He could not reach these rents in the absence of a specific action namely appointment of a receiver in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.974" offset="10327228">He should not be able to do so in Federal court absent at comparable action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.956" offset="10343215">The second reason and one that I think is most important here is that the petitioner's acts in this case or lack of acts have really disrupted the orderly administration of this bankruptcy because the first time that petitioner ever came in and said I have a right to these rents was after the property had been sold, after his proof of claim had been submitted, in fact in his proof of claim he specifically disclaimed any interest in these rents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.995" offset="10451362">What he said was I have no interest other than “that in the note and deed of trust.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.389" offset="10484903">Neither of those documents said anything about security interest in rents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.977" offset="10499323">So he presented this to the trustee and said here is my proof of claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.001" offset="10511339">The trustee looked at it and said fine and acted on that basis and then some six months afterwards he comes back in and says, well I also have a proof, I also have a claim on the primary source of income from this estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.515" offset="10581452">That is simply confounding the trustee and will continue to confound the trustee in future cases if that is the result that is allowed here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2643.285" offset="10676537">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.279" offset="10688449">Speaking of trustee as my colleague just stated it is important for the trustee in the Bankruptcy Court and creditor's committee and others interested in a bankruptcy to know as soon as possible what the liens or security interests are on assets in a particular bankruptcy case and this need to know we suggest is amply satisfied by reliance on local law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.275" offset="10788446">The local law is the source that we contend should be applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.682" offset="10814151">Reliance on local law gives the debtor creditor relationship emphasis or it gives them the knowledge that they need in the transactions and dealing with real estate and mortgages on them so that when there is a bankruptcy case everybody knows what their liens and what their status their rights are with respect to certain assets in the bankrupt estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.939" offset="10919163">Everybody in this particular case relied upon that fact that is that the local law was governing and the fact of the matter is that under local law, the petitioner had has no lien on the rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.679" offset="10978095">The petitioner had a second mortgage on the real-estate not a lien on the rents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.659" offset="11021981">Bankruptcy intervening should not expand any of the rights of a second mortgagee and grant to him any lien that he did not have and that would be inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.245" offset="11080391">We suggest that the bankruptcy law, the bankruptcy court should follow the jurisdiction of the situs of the property and I do not believe that we really have any dispute about the law of North Carolina, Greg versus Williamson or the Parker case as we have cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.281" offset="11164505">In North Carolina just to simply be redundant if I will if you permit me a mortgagee has to file an action in state court to foreclose his mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.329" offset="11220720">As a part of the foreclosure he can obtain as an ancillary remedy the appointment ordering receiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.742" offset="11266382">The law is that he must obtain possession, that is he must acquire a deed before he is entitled to the rents under the law of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.294" offset="11316537">The analogous part in bankruptcy, if you want to talk about due process a mortgagee has remedies available, procedures available to it in the existing Bankruptcy Act that is Part VII of the Bankruptcy Act, Rule 701 in the subsections and sections thereafter allows a trustee or creditor to institute an adversary proceeding which is called a complaint, the service like our adversary proceeding before the court in North Carolina to foreclose a mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.653" offset="11477974">This procedure and the adversary proceedings allows you to “recover property or money, to determine the validity, priority or extend of the lien or other interest in property, to sell property free of a lien or other interest, to objective or evoke discharge, to obtain an injunction, to obtain relief from a stay that is the injunction under Rule 401 or 406 or to determine the dischargability of a debt.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.984" offset="11591346">That adversary proceedings section Rule 701 under Part VII is the whole mechanical or procedural set up in the Bankruptcy Act in the bankruptcy courts whereby a mortgagee goes in the court, seeks an order from the bankruptcy court to allow him to foreclose on his mortgage under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.297" offset="11688521">We believe that adversary proceeding section of the Bankruptcy Act is a critical part of this case, that is the method or the mechanics procedure whatever you want to call it whereby other secured creditors went into this bankruptcy court and filed an action to recover and did recover their --</text>

            <text syncTime="3413.247" offset="13756374">The abandonment would have occurred during the straight bankruptcy or liquidation part of the bankruptcy proceedings but even during the arrangement what I wanted to emphasize is the adversary proceedings section is available to all creditors and in fact that does stop a lot arrangements because one of the creditors that are secured, that is secured, does not go along and he files an adversary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.753" offset="13874343">We suggest that the petitioner took no comparable or analogous action in the bankruptcy court under Rule 701 that is comparable to the state law of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.101" offset="13935783">We think that the local law is the law that should be followed in the bankruptcy courts of where the situs of the property is.</text>

            <text syncTime="3507.982" offset="14135254">Now preamble to that, petition to the opponent Simon Joseph Golden, as an agent say that there was only one employee left and that there need to be somebody there to disburse the funds, to collect and disburse funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="3531.584" offset="14229713">Two more minutes, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.442" offset="14237132">First of all, I would like to address myself to Mr. Justice Stevens' questions that is I appreciate the fact that he brought to the Court's attention that this affidavit which takes up a substantial part for perhaps two-thirds on the government's brief in this case and their argument regarding equity in the property was filed on November the 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.670" offset="14326053">It was prepared and signed by the trustee on November the 11 and the decision of the district court judge was on November the 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.943" offset="14359176">I had frankly do not think that was even considered by the District Court Judge and it is a hindsight look at what happened after the petitioner got the property and we argue and contend it should not be considered in any decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.257" offset="14412361">Secondly, it is clear from the record in this case that there was no equity in this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.857" offset="14434826">If that is consideration in the Court, it's clear that there was no equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.982" offset="14447261">At the first sale even according to the government's figures, the deficiency on the petitioner's debt was substantially more than at the second sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.797" offset="14490520">Now the trustee would argue that the fact that there was a bankruptcy order involved with that allowing the petitioner to bid in his second deed of trust, chilled a competitive bidding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.314" offset="14528658">In fact, the sale brought more money at the second sale than it did at the first sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.590" offset="14545690">There was clearly no equity in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.699" offset="14554154">I ask that the Court to look at the first meeting of creditors in the appendix where the trustee who is argued to this Court today stated that there was no -- in his opinion there was no equity and a property and that it was clear that there was no equity in the property as in December.</text>
