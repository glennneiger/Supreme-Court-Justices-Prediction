            <text syncTime="69.194" offset="380113">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.527" offset="397458">This case presents as a matter of first impression the issue of whether Title IX of the Education Amendments 1972 maybe enforced in a federal civil action the particular case involves in the application to medical school which allegedly was denied on the basis of sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.102" offset="479796">Title IX provides impertinent part no person in the United States shall on the basis of sex be excluded from any education program receiving federal financial assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.489" offset="529324">At Bedrock, this case asked the question in words of this Court from Allen versus the State Board of Elections whether that sweeping promise of Congress is to be merely an empty promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.116" offset="587839">The current operating plan of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare's office for civil rights contemplates a predicted backlog of 3570 civil rights complaints including 889 which includes allegations of sex discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.501" offset="661400">Title IX applies to approximately 97,000 institutions, a number of participants according to HEW is approximately 55 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.696" offset="706121">As of September 30, 1976, HEW had asked 20,318 school districts and colleges to file compliance statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.621" offset="753873">By the following March, 1977, only 6742 had done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.021" offset="783444">The enforcement task is enormous, much more enormous than that faced by the Attorney General with respect to election laws and considered by this Court in the Allen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.330" offset="832658">In fact, HEW has declared itself it has no hope of making a complete enforcement job for this spread of concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.825" offset="882709">Now HEW in its brief to me, made the most significant point of any other briefs including our own and that is that Congress clearly contemplated that voluntary compliance would be the primary means for enforcements not only of Title IX but of its predecessor legislation Title VI subsequent legislation dealing with handicap and age discrimination.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="218.515" offset="977481">If HEW sees a violation here do you have any hypothesis to suggest why HEW has not proceeded to enforce the statute as you construe the statute?</text>

            <text syncTime="233.771" offset="1038503">Yes, I -- two things, I -- obviously, there was some confusion between the District 5 office in Chicago and the National Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.313" offset="1084583">The National Office in the opinion which is attached to the petition for certiorari has long maintained the position and particularly with respect to Title IX since September of 1974 that there is a private right of action to enforce Title IX whereas the District office went into the Federal District Court and denied the existence of the private right of action and said they were proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.194" offset="1192103">And indeed there is in the appendix a copy of my correspondence with the United States attorney in Chicago that indicated the regional director plan to conduct this particular investigation during the first half of January 1976.</text>

            <label>Mr. John M. Cannon</label>
            <text syncTime="296.979" offset="1291264">Quite frankly Your Honor, the Carnegie Foundation characterized it as the atomic bomb and I think it's perhaps too lethal in the sense that we referred in our reply brief to -- going through the fund-cutoff procedures with HEW as playing Russian roulette with an institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.907" offset="1367019">Too many of our wonderful institutions of higher learning and other federally assisted organizations are dependent for anything like their current mode of operation on federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.897" offset="1418951">Putting the federal funds at risk is one thing that can be avoided by judicial action and HEW pointed that out in the --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="335.696" offset="1446118">Well, Congress -- you're making a very good argument that the Congress should have affirmatively, clearly and unequivocally provided for a private action as an alternative but is that an argument that we should weigh?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_cannon" startTime="357.210" stopTime="482.906">
            <label>Mr. John M. Cannon</label>
            <text syncTime="357.210" offset="1532217">Well, in considering why they may not have done that, I would point out that legislating in that particular area gets very touchy particularly with the background being Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.430" offset="1585089">And consider the fact that this Court probably would not have tolerated and Congress was quite well aware that it would not tolerate a reverse of that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.974" offset="1627303">And historically, there has not been an expressed authorization for federal jurisdiction to remedy what is at Bedrock constitutional violations by federal authorities and in this case as well as Title VI, it's the utilization of federal funds to support discriminatory activity which may well be and in many cases clearly was recognized as constitutional violations so that the absence of a provision is not really new.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.966" offset="1783202">In fact, the greatest powers of this Court tracing back in the private right of action to some recent cases with Bivens and Bell versus Hood but more deeply through Marbury and all the way back to the King's bench that where there is a legal right provided unless there is a legal remedy, that it's not much of a right and that of course is our basic question.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.572" offset="1889677">Is this an empty promise or will it be enforced and for the present, it simply must be enforced by the courts or it's not going to be enforced at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.588" offset="1917680">HEW, the one to do the enforcing has told us so and the facts are quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.869" offset="1966895">Moreover, even if HEW could conceivably somehow get around to this enormous number of cases, the regulations that they have promulgated and by the time Title IX came along and followed with the other legislation, these regulations were in existence and known to counties.</text>

            <text syncTime="526.014" offset="2207431">It is the immediacy of the judicial action as HEW pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.293" offset="2236583">Many institutions like all of us would like to go on our own way and not consider something, be accused of a violation of civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.629" offset="2265840">It's not a pleasant thing to contemplate.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.029" offset="2279528">But to take it seriously and provide meaningful internal procedures, immediate outside enforcement by an independent agency be it a Court or HEW is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.357" offset="2332818">But at least for this time, unless the courts can step in and provide immediate supervision, there cannot be enforcement of the sweeping language of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.804" offset="2390601">And when the Court considers the fundamental rights that are covered by that promise, I would suggest to the Court that neither the judiciary nor the executive or the Congress itself has anymore important business than enforcing of social justice among our own citizens.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="589.147" offset="2459982">Now, you've spoken of these numbers, that 55 million figure of course is pretty staggering but 3500 isn't all that staggering.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.136" offset="2503868">That's roughly a hundred cases per districts, federal district although they would not be evenly spread of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.419" offset="2545037">Did I say a hundred, I meant to say 300, about 300 cases per district.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.811" offset="2578578">That's just a little bit over the case load for one district judge on average case load figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.959" offset="2611179">So it isn't quite staggering as the 55 million potential, is it?</text>

            <text syncTime="631.266" offset="2628420">Absolutely and it's really, as HEW pointed out in their brief, the availability of the judicial remedy that is going to lead to meaningful internal compliance procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.120" offset="2679829">And whether one views the procedure as primarily aimed at providing outside judgement on the internal affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.000" offset="2747329">And any judicial review being de novo or under a standard of clearly wrong or some other such standard, the importance is its immediacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.524" offset="2781497">A district judge just like an agency is going to be influenced by the quality of the internal investigation, the internal record that's made on considering the matters at issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="689.893" offset="2862895">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.391" offset="2876897">The Government's position in this matter is essentially that presented by my Brother just a few moments ago that we have a statute that requires the construction of this Court to determine whether it was -- whether it affords a private remedy against a private party that is a recipient of federal funds in the education area.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.975" offset="2983267">We argue that three years before the statute was enacted, namely in 1969 in Allen versus the State Board of Election, this Court was confronted with the necessity of construing a similar statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.098" offset="3055783">That statute provided no person shall be denied the right to vote for failure to comply with a newly covered enactment that the statute consisted of.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.102" offset="3123806">That of course required the preclearance of changes in election laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.420" offset="3149093">And there was an elaborate scheme of enforcement which ultimately required the Attorney General to bring an action in -- with the restricted venue to the District of Columbia to see whether the election change required preclearance to see that it didn't offend the objectives of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.603" offset="3253791">Now in a case with as complicated, an administrative procedure for enforcement even requiring the bringing of the action by the attorney general in a particular venue, this Court nevertheless looking at the language, no person shall be denied the right to vote for failure to comply found an intent on the part of the Congress not only to create a private right in an individual but also to afford him a remedy in the federal courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="885.982" offset="3647300">And if Title IX was found to create a private cause of action, 13434 would afford jurisdiction for federal court to entertain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.499" offset="3697351">And that's the crux of our argument that Section 9 does create a private cause of action against a private recipient of federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.139" offset="3747924">And if it does jurisdiction lies and the Court should've heard the matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="959.213" offset="3940185">As a matter of fact, the legislative history indicates that Title IX was originally contemplated as an amendment to the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.837" offset="3986683">But later was enacted as part of the Education Amendments of 1972 but its clear language that no person shall on the basis of sex be denied participation in or be -- or deny the benefits of or be discriminated against in any federally financed education program clearly is the kind of language the Congress has used when it has intended to confer a private right of action to remedy a deprivation of civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.805" offset="4154598">Senator Birch Bayh who was the sponsor of Title IX in the Senate, clearly stated that the purpose of Title IX was to eradicate the years of discrimination against particularly women but it wasn't limited to women against persons on the basis of sex.</text>

            <text syncTime="1215.040" offset="4963558">But Congress apparently has relied upon this language formula to create a private cause of action when it intends to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.236" offset="5008280">Now on the other hand, the Congress has used other kinds of language formulae when it has intended to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.378" offset="5048926">For example, the Congress should have said -- could have said that no educational institution shall -- or any educational institution that discriminates on the basis of sex will not receive federal funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.676" offset="5122069">And in such an instance, I would be hard put to argue that someone who felt discriminated against could find from that a private right created in him and a federal remedy to vindicate that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.095" offset="5187793">But here, the language consistently runs through the series of civil rights actions which are intended to remedy against discrimination on the basis of race, on the basis of sex, on the basis of age, on the basis of physical handicaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.561" offset="5265638">This language no person shall be discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.386" offset="5284968">And when it intended to give a restricted right of action, it so expressed itself as it did in Title II and in Title VII, when it intended to have no private cause of action despite the use of that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.974" offset="5359261">It has expressly stated that the administrative remedy will be exclusive as it did in Title III of the Older American Amendments of 1975 but when it did neither, it appears that the Congress intended then for the recipient of this right to be afforded a federal remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1376.292" offset="5608573">And the Congress did use this linguistic formula even though he was unable to get there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.301" offset="5656534">If the Congress had intended not to grant a private remedy then it would not have concluded nearly with rebuffing Senator Keating it would seem to me but it would've expressed the contrary or would've utilized contrary language as we can see it did in this other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.901" offset="5754964">This Court of course address the -- this whole matter of determining when a -- when there should be an extension of a civil remedy to a person injured by another's breach of a right granted in the case of Cort versus Ash in 1975 and suggested for questions that must be answered and I would like to consider those for a few minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.491" offset="5889337">The first one of course is whether the plaintiff is one of the class for whose special benefit the statute was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.360" offset="5924864">I think its irrefutable here that Mrs. Cannon is one of the class for whose special benefit the statute was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.834" offset="5970735">I think we can conclude without argument that she was a person who was to have received a federal right and that she did indeed receive it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.360" offset="6024861">I argued as I we do on our brief on page 46 in the following pages that the use of the language has been consistent in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.598" offset="6069791">The second question of course is whether there is any indication of legislative intent to create a private remedy or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.729" offset="6106258">Now of course if there was convincing evidence of intent, we wouldn't even apply the Cort versus Ash formula if there was unmistakable evidence that there was no intent that would conclude our discussion and if there was unmistakable evidence, there was intent, it would as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.005" offset="6191417">Here, we have to conclude that the evidence is ambivalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.454" offset="6213151">Nevertheless, we suggest that such evidence does exist, does favor the finding that the legislature intended to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.574" offset="6253693">I suggested before the consistency of the language and I direct the Court's attention also to the fact that there were lower court cases granting a private remedy in Title VI after which Title IX was adopted at the time the Congress adopted Title IX.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.942" offset="6355153">Now, whether the Congress was acutely and actually aware of those decisions, I can't argue but I certainly can suggest that they were there for the Congress' direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.172" offset="6416071">But even if we concede that the second point that of legislative intent is ambivalent, we proceed to the third point, is it consistent with the underlying purpose to imply a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.599" offset="6469778">I suggest that the answer here is a compelling yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.486" offset="6489318">My Brother has indicated the problem of the -- of numbers that would make it difficult for persons whose rights were offended to get a private remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.635" offset="6533935">I would also add that the cutoff isn't a remedy for Mrs. Cannon and if the Government should cutoff the funds, she and many persons like here would still be without a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.464" offset="6585240">Also in the case of a single grant, single federal grant with nothing in the way of sustaining funds contemplated, there would be no need for a cutoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.752" offset="6626408">And yet she would be without any administrative remedy at all because there isn't anything the administrative agency could do for her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.892" offset="6658905">And finally, whether this is a right traditionally relegated to state law, I suggest that this is uniquely federal because federal funds are involved and the Federal Government has a right to be free from discrimination or to see that its funds are not employed to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.187" offset="6732152">I would conclude by saying that private litigation is an indispensable compliment of the Government action if the goals of Title IX, freedom from discrimination on the basis of sex are to be achieved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1709.403" offset="6941027">In this case for example, there were some 2,000 applicants whose academic credential were superior to the plaintiff in this case so that I suppose if they had chosen to bring individual suits, there could have been 2000 additional suits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1754.987" offset="7123362">The first one is Title VII, the employment case was an area under which the Congress has not ventured before and the basis for its jurisdiction there was the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.637" offset="7177906">And it was extending some previously understood concepts of the Commerce Clause and therefore I thought it should closely restrict their private remedy as it explored this new area of extending federal power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.372" offset="7248854">Here under Title IX, there is absolutely no question about the power of the Congress to control the spending of federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.055" offset="7287620">And so it need not have felt as queasy about proceeding -- about forwarding a private remedy there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1972.287" offset="7992508">The -- it's been applied in the arguments of petitioner and the Solicitor General that Title VI and Title IX are to be interpreted together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.866" offset="8030856">We may recall that Title VI was a subject to some consideration by the Court in the Bakke case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.830" offset="8054680">It is our position that Section 1 of each of these Titles states a policy and that Section 2 creates a very elaborate enforcement procedure and that that enforcement procedure is exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.544" offset="8105566">We think that examining the terms of the statute on their face reveals this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.017" offset="8119463">We think the setting of Title VI in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 where other Titles did contain specific provision for private remedy confirms the intent which appears from the face of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.168" offset="8164080">But most important we think the legislative debates which gave flesh to what appears on the face of the statute confirm the assertions that we have made in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.062" offset="8203577">Now, throughout this litigation, we have constantly referred to the legislative debates, what was said, what exchanges we have on the floor of the Senate and the House and up until last Thursday, we have had no response to this from the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.802" offset="8262614">Last Thursday a brief was filed, a reply brief which sets out some excerpts from the legislative debates which purport to make a point that the first section of Title VI and by implication Title IX is independent of the enforcement procedure under Section 2 of each of these Titles and that therefore the implication is that a part of that right of action could be implied even though there was no expressed provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.530" offset="8357491">Since I could not anticipate these references nor will I have a further opportunity to respond, I would like to start my argument with the reference to these arguments by -- in the petitioner's reply brief and show that they completely is -- or misstated when I say that advisably, it certainly do not support the position asserted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2131.851" offset="8630732">And Senator Humphrey is quoted as responding, "Yes".</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.697" offset="8642121">Now the implication of this is that they have the right to go to Court under Section 1, Title VI and Title IX.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.995" offset="8663333">Well, not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.561" offset="8669602">This was the culmination of a long statement by Senator Talmadge opposing the Civil Rights Act in its entirety in Title VI in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.467" offset="8701262">And the point he was making that there was a preexisting right under 1983 for a right of action against the state action where discrimination was alleged whether there was or was not federal funding and his point was that the -- this Act which gave the power to the executive to cut off federal funding was totally unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.058" offset="8787571">It was very oppressive and had the seeds for destruction of local government “that I quote where he said just about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.991" offset="8815365">When enhanced to the extent there was a legitimate governmental interest in this matter, it was already covered under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.881" offset="8842846">And it was in this context that he made the point, the people have the authority to go to court and the Senator admits they have that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.235" offset="8868342">He was speaking of the then existing state of the law not with the bill which was being considered and Senator Humphrey responded, "Yes, they do".</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.475" offset="8901256">And then Senator Talmadge which sort of sums up the point he was trying to make said, "Why does not the Senator relying on the Court's authority instead of giving arbitrary capricious wholesale punitive power to some federal bureaucrat to starve entire cities, towns, states and regions at one fell swoop".</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.669" offset="8970010">He simply didn't like Title VI at all and he was simply urging on the Senate that they not adopt it in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.271" offset="9000417">Senator Humphrey responded and I'm reading now from the Congressional Record 110, page 5246 which is not included on the reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.987" offset="9031346">Senator Humphrey replied, but we develop here what I call the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.256" offset="9052348">I wish to make it clear that Section 602, second section is a limitation on the enforcement of the law set out in Section 601 of Title VI to those agencies affected by Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.852" offset="9094771">Now that exchange disturbed Senator Case because he thought that that statement could be implied as limiting the preexisting rights under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.581" offset="9133746">So Senator Case got into the Act and he said to Senator Humphrey, I'm disturbed about that limitation language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.359" offset="9160808">I don't want this statute to take away preexisting rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.197" offset="9176168">And that's when the exchange culminated in the two quotations you find in the bottom of page 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.699" offset="9202186">Now, you'll see that there are dots indicating omissions from those quotations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.343" offset="9216711">Now, the dots are very significant, to the heart of this case but they have been omitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.577" offset="9233638">I'd like to fill the dots in if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.089" offset="9243773">Senator Case says and I'm quoting from what's in the brief, “For myself, I would not be satisfied if this language in Section 602 is intended to limit existing rights of individuals under the constitution or to limit the rights expressed in Section 601 in any substantial sense…” alright, here is what the dots say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.963" offset="9331231">Federal departments or agencies with authority to disperse loans, grants or to make contracts in order to eliminate discrimination in programs in which those contracts, loans or grants are involved must proceed in the fashion stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.208" offset="9384208">With that I agree and then he goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.513" offset="9393403">“That is the intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.087" offset="9399672">However, it is not intended to limit the rights of individuals if they have any way of enforcing their rights apart from the provisions of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.373" offset="9436871">Apart from the provisions of the bill by way of suit or any other procedure, the provision of the bill is not intended to cut down any rights that exist”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.735" offset="9470307">That was the thrust of the discussion which is set out here on page 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.780" offset="9486503">And then Senator Humphrey responded as it was set out here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.438" offset="9501132">"I thoroughly agree with the Senator insofar as the individual is concerned…”</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.024" offset="9519417">Then you see dots again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.535" offset="9525478">Now, here's what the dots say, “As a citizen of the United States, he has his full constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.131" offset="9551914">He has his full -- he has his right to go to court and institute suit and whatever may be provided in the law and in the constitution".</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.884" offset="9582947">They were talking about existing law not what the bill would do and the implication of the reply brief that somehow this was intended to enlarge these rights or the change of existing law is completely foreclosed by the discussion I have alluded to.</text>

            <text syncTime="2407.692" offset="9734144">His problem was that the bill did not provide a private right of action for the individual and here is what he says under Sections -- under Section 603, that's the judicial review section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.351" offset="9776776">A state or political subdivision of a state or an agency of either which has denied funds because of discrimination -- because discrimination is taking place is given the right of action in Court but there is no correlative right in the citizen.</text>

            <text syncTime="3207.297" offset="12932577">I think what they're saying is that if this Court says you can go to Court then we don't proceed and that's the bypass that Justice White was talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.124" offset="12967894">It's inevitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.950" offset="12971133">We got another dilemma.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.023" offset="12975417">Let's suppose they do proceed two ways, administratively and judicially.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.042" offset="12995584">It comes up in court under one standard of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.347" offset="13004779">It comes up through the administrative agency and judicial review under the APA standard review which is entirely different so you can -- the conception of it at least, the same court can decide the same question under different standards and come out different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.239" offset="13060368">The dilemma is simply unavoidable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.618" offset="13069876">It seems to me if the Court please that there is no way you can give credit to the elaborate scheme under Section 2 of each of the statutes if you allow an independent private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.933" offset="13111150">Judicial review is another matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.464" offset="13121181">So I submit that this clearly sets forth the answer to the third Cort v. Ash test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.530" offset="13149497">Now the Government makes one other point in its reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.545" offset="13161514">It -- I think it was lecturing me but I'm not quite sure about my failure to perceive the difference between primary jurisdiction and exhaustion of remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.209" offset="13196204">And they are -- they go to great detail to explain that in circumstances like this where they are in court on our Title VI case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.549" offset="13225566">They may under the appropriate circumstance ask the Court to defer action while they complete the administrative process and they say that's the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.290" offset="13260570">That's what they're talking about in the -- it seem particularly upset by my statement that I was confused about their course of conduct in various cases that we cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.453" offset="13297142">The unfortunate part of the Government's position is that they in fact in the Terry versus Methodist Hospital of Gary case which we refer to in our brief, they themselves filed the motion to dismiss for failure to -- for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because of lack of exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.077" offset="13359731">The very point we're trying to make they themselves made but now they denied that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.842" offset="13374777">Well, they withdrew that motion subsequently but they withdrew it not because they felt the exhaustion doctrine was improper but because they wanted as they explained in the later document, they wanted to facilitate settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.402" offset="13416991">So they themselves had adopted the exhaustion argument if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.991" offset="13431306">So we're not doing anything noble here that seems to me it's inevitable that you do that if you're to make any sense out of the statute, otherwise you will have a shamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.134" offset="13467878">Well under -- I think this is the essence of my case because what I'm really talking about is what Congress intended and not what Mr. Cannon wants or what I want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.510" offset="13509360">It's ultimately what the Congress said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.900" offset="13522944">A few minor things, I -- they weren't touched upon but I've -- they are in the briefs and that is the reason of managements to the age discrimination act which now provides for a specific right of action with exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.878" offset="13578846">And we made the point in our brief that this manifested an attempt that when Congress means they have a right of action under these kinds of statutes, it knows how to say so clearly.</text>
