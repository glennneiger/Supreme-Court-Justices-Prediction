            <text syncTime="80.695" offset="427217">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.897" offset="443935">William Orr has been required to pay alimony to his former wife under Alabama statutes, which require payment of alimony by husbands only.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.599" offset="490747">And so the question before you today is whether or not these statutes violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of our United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.714" offset="543201">This Court's precedent establishes that laws classifying on the basis of sex are unconstitutional when rooted in the role-typing, one should routinely imposed on women and men.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.325" offset="597744">Two; when that notion that women are men's subordinates and three, over broad gross ranking of men as dominant and independent, women as weak, inferior and dependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.298" offset="657617">As appellee puts it, the law derives from a view of the married woman as a non-entity, a view maintained for centuries but now recognized as archaic, outmoded, and wholly inconsistent with the equal status and dignity of all persons under our law.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.498" offset="738388">Alabama's scheme rooted as it is in historic role-typing cannot be justified as remedial.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.490" offset="766391">Any attempt to address the classification in a compensatory cloak is inevitably deceivable.</text>

            <text syncTime="199.080" offset="900765">However under the Alabama statute, Your Honor, the situation is on a case-by-case method.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.216" offset="933261">Read in context with Alabama's alimony statute is common law origin, the Alabama law was hardly designed with economic preference for women in mind as was Kahn.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.784" offset="975579">On the contrary as the appellee's brief pointed out, the common law subordinated the wife to the husband.</text>

            <text syncTime="989.010" offset="4060432">Getting back to the question that was asked I was though, when read in context with this common law, Alabama law was hardly designated with economic preference for women.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.518" offset="4102437">On the contrary, as the appellee's brief points out, this common law subordinated women to husbands; declared wives disable and stripped over capacity to sustain herself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.160" offset="4145068">In essence, appellee's argument that the very legal regime discriminates against a woman can be salvaged if that regime throws the woman a bone after placing her in the cage and this argument could not withstand actual reflection and reason analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.146" offset="4209016">You asked me about Kahn; support for one-way alimony statutes, there is a scheme now maintained by rapidly dwindling number of states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.665" offset="4247050">Now, this Court's decision in Kahn v. Shevin can be distinguished, subsequent decisions Wiesenfeld and Goldfarb, make it apparent that Kahn will not bear the weight that the appellee would place upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.354" offset="4301803">As we know Kahn upheld a property tax exemption worth $15 annually, granted to voters but not to where it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.194" offset="4333150">A key factor in Kahn was the other impracticability of awarding the $15 dispensation on a case-by-case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.808" offset="4367632">In the show of contrast an alimony in Alabama has never awarded categorically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.714" offset="4387276">The individual case, one's ability to pay, the length of the marriage, the other person's need, all these and other factors, determine how much should be paid and for how longer period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.113" offset="4436804">But given that fact that Alabama has chosen to make alimony awards on a case-by-case basis, there is no necessity whatsoever for classification by sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.536" offset="4486541">Tax classification, because of the impracticability of individualized adjudications is an area in which states have large leeway, but there is no warrant for such leeway in an area such as the one at bar where adjudication must be made again on a case-by-case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.888" offset="4551952">Thus the administrative convenience, the prime consideration in Kahn is not tenable argument to our case before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.950" offset="4588210">Sparing the public purse is not a consideration here as it was in Kahn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.247" offset="4605346">And in addition, the $15 favoring Kahn was no slide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.591" offset="4622796">It was so slided, it could not be expected to affect the behavior of men and women.</text>

            <text syncTime="1208.006" offset="4936370">Men in both cases, as in the instant case, gender type casting frozen in legislation was the target, which was successfully attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.638" offset="4978897">In Califano v. Webster, this Court carefully distinguished historic knee-jerk, gender-based categorization no modern law passed in direct response to a wage in job placement, bias against women.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.683" offset="5035112">The Webster per curiam makes it clear that the Court will uphold a gender classification, alleged to be it compensatory only if the law in fact was enacted to check adverse discrimination women encounter and not out of prejudice about women's weakness, inferiority, and dependency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.686" offset="5111181">Further such genuine compensation clarifications must match that remedial end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.020" offset="5140438">Therefore the differential at bar surely does not fit the Webster, it rests on the traditional way of thinking about females.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.820" offset="5171681">It plainly was not enacted to remedy or to reduce hostility to women in the labor market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.557" offset="5202610">In summation, the gender classification at issue is a means to allocate maintenance, responsibility post-divorce is patently unfair and does not relate substantially to the state objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.946" offset="5260184">Functional sex-neutral classification is the fair means readily available to request rights and obligations between spouses, because one way alimony is a historical hangover that discriminates against men and stigmatizes women, the decision below cannot survive reason review and consequently we respectfully request that the Alabama alimony statute beheld unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2499.744" offset="10103390">I think that's the effect of it, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.313" offset="10133692">Let me give an example of what I considered to be a fairly typical alimony case which I think illustrates the justice of the Alabama law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.542" offset="10174548">If you assume that back in 1958, two persons 20 years of age of equal ability and intellect and competence were married, the wife at that point could well have surveyed the job market and made a decision to enter it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.834" offset="10259707">You will understand we are talking about 1958 and this would be before the Equal Pay Act and before Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.484" offset="10290322">She would see a job market where she would make less wages than her male counterpart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.801" offset="10311638">She would have less opportunity for advancement and perhaps even less opportunity to get employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.236" offset="10337343">So this hypothetical person back in 1958 would have decided quite reasonably to become a homemaker and the husband at that point perhaps went to work for a bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.987" offset="10384363">20 years later they both 40 years old, they are getting a divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.474" offset="10406306">The husband at this point is inline to become President of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.948" offset="10424174">The wife, if she goes to work for a bank probably has to go to work as a secretary or a teller.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.329" offset="10457715">The difference in the financial rewards offered by the positions of bank President versus bank secretary are obvious, but the differences do not exist because the man is more competent than the woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.340" offset="10513721">The difference exists because of the discriminations against the woman that steered her into her role as homemaker and cost her to forgo the education and the training and the experience that would have today qualified her for the better job in the better paying position in the more responsible position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.166" offset="10589059">Under these circumstances, we say under Alabama law it's entirely proper to compensate her to make up for the opportunity that she lost because of the discrimination she faced back at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.706" offset="10643184">Now the appellant has made the point that there are some men who are dependent on their wives and they need alimony in the event of a divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.094" offset="10680801">That's true and to illustrate that factual situation, let me reverse my example and suppose that this woman back in 1958 had in spite of the discrimination she saw in the job market, gone ahead and gone to work for the bank and the husband became a homemaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.144" offset="10753003">If they were divorced today it would be the husband who had the greater financial need than the wife, but under Alabama law he would not be entitled to alimony, but the big difference here is that he would find himself in financial need by choice rather than force.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.997" offset="10824370">When he surveyed the job market back in 1958, he did not find it unreceptive to him as it was unreceptive to his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.120" offset="10860837">If he stayed out of the labor force it was not because of any discriminations against him and he would not have any claims under a statute which is designed to compensate for past discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.739" offset="10915380">I think this very point was noted in one of the dissents in Kahn versus Shevin where it was said while doubtless some widowers are in financial need, no one suggests that such need results from sex discrimination as in the case of widows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.526" offset="10982463">I think that the same thing could be said of divorcee as was the set of widows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.416" offset="11006077">Many states do have laws which provide for alimony to man and there is nothing wrong with such laws if that type of law is worth the legislature that state determines represents the will of its people but this is not to say that the legislation must be designed in that fashioned to be constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.093" offset="11088729">This is a decision for the state legislatures to make and Alabama has determined that its compensatory alimony law thus represent the will of its people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.100" offset="11132824">So but for the archaic notions regarding women the opportunities would not have been denied them, an alimony wouldn't be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.272" offset="11169499">Since 1971, this Court has repeatedly acknowledged the fact that woman have been denied equal opportunities in the business world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.757" offset="11203459">In the majority opinion in Kahn versus Shevin it was said there can be no dispute that the financial difficulties confronting the lone woman in Florida or any other state exceed those facing men.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.663" offset="11259047">In every sex discrimination case of this Court since 1971, it has been held that if the challenge statute granted an economic preference to woman, it is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.022" offset="11312441">Dissenting in Kahn versus Shevin, Justices Brennan and Marshall argued that Florida tax exemption statute was over inclusive because need was not considered under the terms of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.401" offset="11370015">Under that statute, a wealthy woman who had not suffered from discrimination would have the same tax exemption that a poor woman would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.252" offset="11409408">But I am taking the position that the Alabama alimony law is not subject to that attack because alimony in Alabama is not mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.115" offset="11444830">It's up to the trial judge to make a determination as to whether or not it should be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.567" offset="11466668">Need is certainly a consideration to the used value judge in exercising his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.667" offset="11499060">In Califano versus Webster, this Court held that statutes economically preferring women constitutional unless one of two circumstances existed, unless the law has actually the effect of penalizing woman such as in the Wiesenfeld case or the law was not intended is compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.371" offset="11597908">We have tried to demonstrate today that Alabama's law doesn't penalize woman because it doesn't produce dependency, it doesn't steer them into a role as a homemaker and make them dependent on their husbands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.429" offset="11650152">As I have said I thank dependency is already established by the time of divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.379" offset="11673872">The roles to be played by the parties to a marriage are ordinarily selected at the beginning of the marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.639" offset="11698949">I don't think it's reasonable to suppose that marriages are begun in anticipation of divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.660" offset="11727057">So the prospect of alimony should not be a significant factor in the selection of roles by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.862" offset="11759867">In any event alimony speculative is to where it will be awarded or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.105" offset="11776794">Mr. Capell mentioned that he thought perhaps in 25% of the cases there was no alimony award made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.394" offset="11805947">I have no statistics to back me up.</text>
