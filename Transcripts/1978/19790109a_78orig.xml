            <text syncTime="71.049" offset="387532">This case comes to this Court upon the State of California's motion for leave to file a complaint against the State of Arizona and against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.032" offset="423476">By our motion, we seek to invoke this Court's original and exclusive jurisdiction to finally determine title to sovereign lands along an 11.3 mile reach of the Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.447" offset="473109">The lands in this -- an issue in this action are sovereign lands and were at the time of California's admission to the union within the bed of the Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.145" offset="511979">Along the river as the Court knows there have been many accretive and avulsive changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.967" offset="531205">These river movements' generated serious confusion and controversy until 1966 when by an interstate boundary compact ratified by Congress in that year, the political boundary between the two states was set and permanently fixed forever more.</text>

            <text syncTime="131.874" offset="630888">Mr. Justice Blackmun some of the lands are within California entirely, some of the lands like a stride of the interstate border the 8.6 mile southern reach of the river, it has the political border running approximately through the center, but just approximately it does vary, but the political boundary will not change as a result of this litigation, it will remain the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.647" offset="722004">The problem we have here again is who owns, how much of the last riverbed does California own, how much of the last riverbed does Arizona own.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.307" offset="760560">The United States is a party because United States is a principle upland owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.668" offset="778010">It owns the lands adjacent to the river and as the Court knows the boundary line between the two states is the middle of the main channel, in order to fix the main channel we must also know the bank lines.</text>

            <text syncTime="211.596" offset="949791">As Your Honor may recall the test is one of navigability of the water course and the question now is where was that water course on the date of California's admission in 1850 and where has it moved by non-accretive changes thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.270" offset="1016456">So California, in 1972 because of the concern over the problem of location of its sovereign lands began a study at the request of the State Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.850" offset="1062745">Four years were spent on that study and a set of maps was prepared.</text>

            <text syncTime="820.019" offset="3383463">That's the only purpose for the term exclusive was to surmount the problem created, for example, or discuss, for example, in trials Charles Dowd Box Company versus Courtney, whereby State Court's have concurrent jurisdiction unless it is specifically excluded, that is a sole meaning for the term exclusive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1617.345" offset="6572701">It's simply the provision of the District Court sec 1251 (a) (1), which seems plainly to confine a controversy between two States to this Court alone by using the word exclusive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1674.053" offset="6799548">It might be argued that because the United States is sought to be made a defendant, one looks not at 1252 (a)(1), but rather at 1252 (b)(2), which provides that when the United States and a State of parties the jurisdiction of this Court as many can cut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.431" offset="6889096">It seems to us was however that the presence or absence of the United States does not change the basic fact, which is that this is a controversy between two states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.996" offset="6931310">And indeed again in the Nevada case this Court adverted to the fact that the State parties there were not adverse and accordingly there wasn't exclusive jurisdiction in this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2709.293" offset="10940583">Yes Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.082" offset="10955734">I would like to initially discuss a question and answer post by the Solicitor General which is essence of this action and that is must this case be heard only before this Court and Arizona's positions is not it must not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.259" offset="11028459">I think the simplest answer to this case is to recognize that 1346(f) can be read as a grant of concurrent jurisdiction by Congress to the District Courts regardless of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.858" offset="11102856">This has been done, this sort of approach has been taken prior to 1948 when the Judicial Court stated that cases that begin in which a state was a party had be brought before the United States Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.914" offset="11167013">That post quite a few problems in cases where the United States brought an action against the State and the only jurisdiction was this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.495" offset="11205360">There were many at places for example, in the Safety Appliance Act in U.S. versus California this Court stated that, that particular legislation was actually a grant of concurrent jurisdiction in actions by United States against a State, so that the District Court could in fact hear that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.794" offset="11286549">The same can be done right here in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.299" offset="11296580">Any case that is brought any case with the United States has title to property that is brought by any person, the District Court should have jurisdiction to hear the case regardless who the parties are, that would be a grant of concurrent jurisdiction and would also permit this Court to allow those types of cases to go elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.993" offset="11399293">The actual essence of this case is whether the language in 1251(a)(1) means exactly what it says, it says that jurisdiction must be exclusive in all controversies between two or more states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.245" offset="11464391">This Court's original jurisdiction has been variously interpreted since 1789 of the date of the First Judiciary Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.694" offset="11502111">Recently this Court has implied if not stated indicted that there is an element of discretion in the interpretation of 1251(a)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.840" offset="11558745">The most noteworthy is the recent decision in 1976 of Arizona against New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.307" offset="11588629">In that case this Court stated that it should interrupt 1251(a)(1) in the same manner that the Court would interrupt Article 3 Section (2) Clause (2) of the Constitution, which is the original jurisdiction, grant of power in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.504" offset="11669400">Now if this is correct that means that there is some discretion in 1251(a)(1) and if that's true, then the only, the only question before the Court right now.</text>

            <text syncTime="2928.447" offset="11817148">That was one aspect of the case, the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Stevens indicated that, however I think the Court's primarily concern was that Arizona was actually the issues presented by Arizona were actually being tried in a separate lawsuit in New Mexico by sort of a project and other private citizens, although Arizona was not involved in that case, the issues themselves were being adjudicated in New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.182" offset="11936057">So it was somewhat different in that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2969.854" offset="11982764">The nature of this case it's a quite title action.</text>

            <text syncTime="3741.426" offset="15069080">Well, if you take the words literally controversies between the two states that would definitely be a controversy between two states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.723" offset="15102307">Although that the Constitution doesn't really say that either, the Constitution states that the judicial power shall extent to controversies between two states.</text>

            <text syncTime="3768.813" offset="15178585">It's a factual case, there are not critical sovereign issues and that itself could be an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.945" offset="15203140">What exactly we're talking, when we're talking about sovereign lands, here California says they are sovereign lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.950" offset="15223202">Well, there is an argument that the 1966 compact had an affect on that and it may not be plus the United States is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.622" offset="15257893">And now we think under 1346 F that is a grant of concurring jurisdiction at the very least and if it is then every case, not only this one, but every case where there is a controversy between two states and the United States is defendant can go to the District Court and that will happen quite often in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.207" offset="15340231">And finally I would like to make one more point on this continuing jurisdiction, point that California wants this Court to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="3817.843" offset="15374712">There is no controversy right now on the remaining aspect of this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.465" offset="15401253">The only controversy there is right now is a Davis Lake study.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.385" offset="15420897">This Court has repeatedly held that unless there is a bona fide controversy, a case, a wrong, some right that's its susceptible with judicial determination then this Court will not take jurisdiction of it because there is, it's not justiciable under the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3858.759" offset="15538448">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.582" offset="15549733">Arizona speaks of the possibility that 1346 F makes 1251 A1 a grant of concurrent rather than exclusive jurisdiction and talks about the pre 1948 judicial code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3876.246" offset="15608351">We submit that the Congress's amendment of the code in 1948 makes the plain language very clear and then it's the plain language that has to control here and that's the plain language of 1251.</text>
            <text syncTime="3891.266" offset="15668433">As professor James Moore, the special consultant advisors of the 1948 code stated in his previous commentary on the judicial code, “A large of number of changes many of considerable importance, have been laid here -- have been made the code should be construed with this in mind and where plain language works to change in formal law this change should be given effect” that's at page 83.</text>
            <text syncTime="3916.297" offset="15768534">In fact what occurred in 1948 was, there was a change in the prior law, prior to 1948 the statute provided for exclusive jurisdiction where any case was a party this Court in US versus California in 297 U.S constitute that as permitting a grant of concurrent jurisdiction to lower courts, but Congress changed all that in 1948 and our submission is that that change in addition to reasons I gave during my opening preclude the construction which Arizona advances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.621" offset="15897893">As for whether this is an important case we submit that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3952.055" offset="15911581">These are indeed sovereign lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.023" offset="15927463">We didn't think there was any dispute about that their lands which inured the California by virtue of its sovereignty and Arizona by virtue of its.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.084" offset="15963721">There is no dispute about the importance of those lands that's been clear since Pollard Lessee v. Hagan, whether we want to be here or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.570" offset="16001651">We understand that the Court has a tremendous appellate workload and we've read the list of cases which were cited in a concurring opinion recently this term but we regret to say that under our construction we have no choice, that's what Congress has said and there is simply no alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.584" offset="16077720">The issues are important for other states as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.912" offset="16090990">The choice of law question which Mr. Justice White raised in a very intriguing one, under Nebraska vs. Iowa 406 U.S, it would appear that as to lands located within each state, the law of each state would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.056" offset="16143548">The question as to the law of the boundary between Federal and State land is particularly intriguing because as the Court knows these lands.</text>
