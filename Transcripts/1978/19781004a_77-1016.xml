            <text syncTime="65.263" offset="364440">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.891" offset="382934">The facts of this case involved the estate of Walt Disney.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.375" offset="400906">Under Mr. Disney’s will, he provided that 45% of the residue of his estate was to pass to the Disney Foundation where it was to be held for certain charitable and educational purposes primarily for the support of California Institute of the Art, a school which he helped to found.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.936" offset="487111">During 1967 and 1968, the executors of his estate sold stock of Walt Disney Productions at a substantial gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.102" offset="539773">In computing its tax for those years in which the gain was incurred, the state excluded from tax 45% of the gain, being the gain, which was permanently set aside for and would ultimately pass to the charity, and paid tax therefore on only 55% of its gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.785" offset="630471">Such 55% passed basically to taxable taxpayers, a trust for the family of Walt Disney.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.520" offset="673416">The IRS has taken the position that if the estate wanted to exclude 45% of the gain which was passing to charity, that in computing it’s tax on the 55% of the gain passing to taxable beneficiaries, it had to compute such gain -- it could not use I should say, it could not use in computing the tax on such gain the alternative tax rate which during those years placed a 25% limit on the amount of tax on capital gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.592" offset="817716">What the Internal Revenue Service said was that if you wanted to use the 25% tax rate, that tax rate must be applied against 100% of the gain, including the 45% of the gain that passed to charity.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.256" offset="888351">While the facts in the case are easy to understand, unfortunately, the law is not, and this is due to some very complex style of legislative drafting and also to the interrelationship of several different code sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.471" offset="961285">I believe that the taxpayer has accurately interpreted these code sections and put together the puzzle of these code sections in a way that carries out the intent of Congress and makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.372" offset="1024815">And I would say that the correctness of our interpretation must be judged against the two basic intents of Congress which are quite evident from this particular fact pattern.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.715" offset="1246229">It was dealing with the carrying back of a loss carrying back to a prior year during which the taxpayer calculated his tax using the alternative tax rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.245" offset="1356361">And I just wondered whether your failure to cite is indicative of the fact that maybe it’s against you?</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald E. Gother</label>
            <text syncTime="320.461" offset="1385200">I don’t believe so Your Honor at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.182" offset="1396067">I think also that our interpretation of the code is a literal one in that we are literally interpreting our code section correctly and that the Government is not.</text>

          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="334.312" stopTime="343.255">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="334.312" offset="1440580">What we get down to then and your approach is, it is whether the estate is a conduit, nothing more?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ronald_e_gother" startTime="343.255" stopTime="685.476">
            <label>Mr. Ronald E. Gother</label>
            <text syncTime="343.255" offset="1476420">In part there, in part and whether that conduit system is applicable to the 1201 (b) (2) alternative tax rate calculation, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.225" offset="1532322">Foster Lumber is no different than the Weil case in essence that you had an excess of an ordinary deduction which you couldn’t use against your alternative tax rate and that was a regular ordinary loss carry forward deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.182" offset="1604106">I’m saying that our charitable set aside deduction is an entirely different animal.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.036" offset="1623542">That it is not an ordinary deduction that an individual taxpayer individual or corporate such as in Foster Lumber had, but it is a different type of deduction and it is more of a manifestation of this conduit theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.101" offset="1703790">Also in Foster Lumber the issue was the definition of taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.971" offset="1723225">Well, if there’s anything that is relatively clear in the Internal Revenue Code is the definition of taxable income and I don’t believe that that is in issue here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.272" offset="1772440">We say there are two basic intents of Congress here that are evident.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.852" offset="1790830">One is that there is to be no tax imposed on that part of any capital gain which an estate realizes or any income, which an estate realizes, be it ordinary or on capital gain, which passes ultimately to a charity.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.341" offset="1848717">642 (c) of Internal Revenue Code says that any gain, any income, any item of income gain or ordinary income which is permanently set aside for charity is entitled to a 100% deduction, even though it’s not paid out.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.428" offset="1913083">So that we have a 100% deduction, whether we pay it or don’t pay it out in the particular year.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.476" offset="1937324">It’s referred to as the set aside deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.263" offset="1948400">It's perfectly clear from that that intent of Congress was to exempt from tax that part of income realized by a fiduciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.203" offset="1988211">The second intent of Congress, which is perfectly evident, is that capital gains were to be taxed in those years at a maximum of 25%.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.934" offset="2027081">Now you’ve got these two intents and I believe they are perfectly reconcilable in our case and in due -- and our interpretation carries both to those out.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.104" offset="2071803">The Government's does -- the Government’s interpretation does violence to one if not both of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.389" offset="2096880">The basic issue which separates our self and the Government is best explained in the question of whether the capital gains tax base for computing the alternative tax rate under Section 1201 (b) 2 includes the gain going to the charity.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.749" offset="2170337">This is by far the biggest area of disagreement between ourselves and the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.863" offset="2190817">Section 1201 (b) is set forth on pages 8 (a) and 9 (a) of the appendix of the Government brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.958" offset="2219238">Before getting into the specific language of those sections, I think it’s essential to take -- stand back just a bit and take a look at what is the over all concept of the taxation of estates and trusts.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.789" offset="2278484">We have a peculiar system of taxation here because we have interposed a fiduciary, a third party here.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.932" offset="2307114">We don’t have a taxpayer and his tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.585" offset="2317667">We have a fiduciary and the system, the basic system for taxation of estates or trusts is first you determine what part of the income that the fiduciary realizes is either required to be distributed or will be distributed or is distributed to a taxable beneficiary and that’s one set of income and you put that of to a side.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.556" offset="2441592">The next is that you look to see if there is any income permanently set aside for charity, under 642 if it is, you set that aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.816" offset="2474611">You're then left with a third group, a third body of income that is taxed to the fiduciary and then the question is what tax rate applies to that tax income.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.175" offset="2520064">Now you go to Section 1201.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.727" offset="2530304">1201 (b) says that if you have some capital gains in that year, you compute your tax in a two-step approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.835" offset="2566666">You divide this taxable income that I have over here into its component parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.025" offset="2587460">The first part being ordinary income, the second part being capital gain, and you do that by taking the taxable income that you had here and deduct out the part that is capital gain and on the remaining part you compute your tax at your ordinary income rate, that’s your ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.104" offset="2671783">The part that is capital gain, you then tax at a maximum of 25%.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.389" offset="2696965">Now our position is that if you look at 1201 and apply it literally to what is the taxable income of the estate, our interpretation is as literal as any interpretation can be of that code section that the capital gains referred to in that section, the long-term capital gain is the long-term capital gain that’s in this part taxable to the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.255" offset="2796440">It’s not in the part that’s going out to the taxable beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.591" offset="2809710">It’s not the gain that’s in the part over here for charity and the best way I think I can --</text>

            <text syncTime="749.985" offset="3103326">So that in the fiduciary context that is literally being applied to this other part of income that’s over here, not to these.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.366" offset="3132792">And I think another way of emphasizing then is look at 1201 (b) 1 which now talks about the computation of the partial tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="1042.676" offset="4274030">Now 643 (a) 3 has a very complex section, but the position they take is that that section provides that capital gains that are in the pot going to charity are included or added to distributable net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.667" offset="4338082">That is absolutely wrong, absolutely wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.230" offset="4352293">If you read through 643, 643 starts with the concept of taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.800" offset="4382595">You have some taxable income now and you want to determine how much of that taxable income is going to be taxed to a taxable beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.556" offset="4417599">So, taxable income already has a distributions deduction off, already has a charitable deduction off and so you’ve got to get -- you’ve got to kind of gross this back up to see how much is going to be taxed to the beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.776" offset="4478516">And in the process of grossing up, one of the things that they gross up, or one of the things they do is that 643 (a) 3 says you exclude all capital gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.472" offset="4545285">So you -- they were in taxable income but now you got to take them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.651" offset="4565974">When you take them out, if you take out a 100% of capital gain, you already -- you would take out also those capital gains which are going to charity which would mean -- but they are already out of taxable income so you will be taking them out twice if you did that so the statute has a double negative in there and they said no, no, don’t take out all the capital gains, leave in their the capital gains that are going to stay in the trust and are going to be taxable to the trust and the gains that are permanently set aside for charity, those having already been deducted above.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.498" offset="4705364">So you cannot contend that distributable net income includes any capital gains passing to charity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.054" offset="4739636">It’s a basic error in the Ninth Circuit’s opinion, a basic error in the Government’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.857" offset="4762833">As example of that -- the Ninth Circuit then goes on to say another example of why the conduit theory doesn’t apply to this part of gain going -- setting aside for charity over here is that Section 663 (a) 2 says that in -- 662 (a) 2, says that when you are going to allocate distributable net income in a particular circumstance among taxable beneficiaries, you take distributable net income and then it says (and add to it) the amount of the deduction that you have taken for charity under 642 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.454" offset="4945168">Well obviously distributable net income therefore doesn’t include anything going to charity for the limited purpose of 662 they add -- have that added back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.430" offset="4993128">So basic error that 643 does not provide that distributable net income includes an amount going to charity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.978" offset="5027297">The limited purpose of this add back in 662 of the 642 charitable deduction has nothing to do with estates as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.178" offset="5080064">The very solemn could apply to the estates has something to do with taxable income of trusts and has to do with this concept of a tier beneficiaries that they wanted to make sure, Congress want to make sure that the income tax -- that the taxable beneficiary for whom income was required to be distributed would pay the tax on the maximum taxable income not reduced by anything that was permanently set aside for charity and it just sets up an order of priorities as we see it of this policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2005.811" offset="8126568">Indeed it is gross income of the estate, all of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.328" offset="8144645">There is a case not cited in the party's briefs in which the tax court considered the effect of California law and that case is Estate of Kahn, 8 Tax Court 784.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.220" offset="8204204">The tax court followed the general rule which had been followed in many other earlier cases that title to property does not define the gross taxable assets in the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.731" offset="8270346">The estate for sub-chapter (j) purposes, sub-chapter (j) being those sections dealing with the income taxation of estates is defined in Section 641 to include all income arising from assets within the custody, management and control of the executor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.425" offset="8357073">These assets, the shares of stock in Walt Disney Productions were clearly assets of the estate and when those assets where sold, they generated gross income for the estate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2095.795" offset="8486536">So, I think that the question properly framed is whether the payments here in question constitute a deduction which is allowable under 1201 (b) in the calculation of the alternative tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="2145.161" offset="8684022">Sub-chapter (j) I think makes it clear that in estate like a trust is a taxable entity which is taxable as if it were an individual according to Section 641 with the various modifications in that general scheme is set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.314" offset="8748596">One of the modifications which is critical here is the different kind of charitable deduction permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.750" offset="8778376">An individual for example can take a charitable deduction by giving property to a charity, an estate may not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.603" offset="8805752">An estate may only claim a charitable deduction if it can establish that the amount paid to charity was out of its gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.371" offset="8840861">There is no dispute here that the capital gains which were set aside for the charity were out of the estate's gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.411" offset="8873044">I have not thought there was such a dispute anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.161" offset="8887986">The 45% of the residue of the estate which was earmarked for qualified charities meant that 45 % of the capital gains generated by the estate, its capital gains qualified for the charitable deduction set aside in arriving at the estates taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.979" offset="8979310">And I think that’s where we must begin as Judge Sneed in the Ninth Circuit by pointing out that in the normal computation of an estate's taxable income, it’s capital gains are first computed, including all of the sale of these shares of stock, the 1202 deduction, the deduction of 50% of the capital gains is then computed on the full amount of those gains which would include the 45% as tax payer's first position had indicated and then the balance left in taxable income after an appropriate adjustment for the fact that there has been a 1202 deduction already for part of those capital gains, is then permitted as a deduction under Section 642 (c) as long as it meets the conditions of that section, that is they must be permanently set aside for charity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.597" offset="9229772">The set aside deduction is really a rather special deduction because it involves allowing an estate to take a deduction for an amount not actually paid out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.090" offset="9271777">There is obviously a room for abuse for sheltering income which will be going to the private beneficiaries of the trust and for that reason they’ve set aside deduction like the rest of the charitable deduction in 642 (c) as restricted to gross income items.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.730" offset="9358294">Now, if I may proceed from that basic point which I think is the statutory scheme that the estate must report and take into account all of the gross income which it generates by sale of estate assets?</text>

            <text syncTime="2978.889" offset="12018918">In that case, because of the discretion, the conditions in 642 (c) would not be met, the amount going to charity would not be guaranteed and the estate would be fully taxable on all that income, there would be no refund for the amount -- excuse me, ultimately determined to go to charity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.885" offset="12098957">The charity indeed would take the amount which it will take here as a residuary legatee reduced by whatever expenses, including income tax as the estate encounters during the course of administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.336" offset="12156740">I think that in every case even the extreme case you have suggested of an estate left outright to charity, the estate must file an income tax return, report its gross income and demonstrate that the income earned does qualify for the charitable set aside deduction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3081.622" offset="12429876">Now the -- if I may return for one moment to the so-called confusion as to the development of the charitable deduction, I think that the preoccupation of the Second Circuit and of counsel for the tax payer on Section 643 and the computation of DNI is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.645" offset="12553906">I think for purposes of this argument, we would be willing to concede that tax payer's version of the computation of distributable net income and its attack on the example which we set out in our brief is correct, but we do submit that that is just utterly irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.629" offset="12633840">You come to the question of distributable net income only after you have arrived at taxable income and in the course of that, the taxable income of the estate has started out with gross income which includes all of the capital gains and then has been diminished by that part of a charitable deduction which or that part of a set aside for charity which comes out of gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.083" offset="12743659">And it’s only at that point after you’ve arrive at taxable income that the DNI or distributable net income adjustments become relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.926" offset="12783052">We suggest that the only point of looking at the distributable net income scheme is to demonstrate as Judge Sneed did that the only conduit theory, the only distribution theory of sub-chapter (j) has to do with private beneficiaries who share in the tax load to the extent there is a current distribution of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.411" offset="12889004">To the extent the income is retained that remains taxable to the estate regardless of how it is ultimately distributed and the charitable set aside deduction of 642 (c) is simply one of the deductions in arriving a taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.219" offset="12960266">When you go to look at the alternative tax in 1201 (b), we suggest that there’s no more reason for pulling out the charitable deduction than there would be for pulling out the executors commissions which maybe deductions in looking at the way, the computation of net capital gains is to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.769" offset="13054412">We suggest the Court was quite correct in its assumptions and both opinions in Foster Lumber that net capital gains means net capital gains for purposes of the alternative tax.</text>
