            <text syncTime="14.956" offset="163192">At issue in the present case are the sentencing provisions of the New Jersey murder statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.823" offset="186702">It is our position that that statute penalizes the defendant's right to jury trial in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments as applied to the states to the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.975" offset="231320">It is also our position that that statute violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by creating a discriminatory classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.878" offset="270921">In effect, there are two penalties for the crime of first degree or felony murder in New Jersey depending solely upon whether the defendant has exercise his right to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.116" offset="315852">If the defendant is willing to enter a non vult plea to an indictment for murder then I should stop for the moment and indicate that in New Jersey, we do not allow guilty pleas to the crime of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.742" offset="366320">A defendant must enter a plea of either non vult or nolo contendere both of which are basically the equivalent of a guilty plea.</text>

            <text syncTime="82.210" offset="432253">In fact, that the common practices for all pleas to be entered as non vult pleas.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.819" offset="458689">If that defendant enters a non vult plea in a murder case, he maybe sentence either to life imprisonment or to a term of not more than 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.194" offset="500172">This is true even though the defendant in setting fort a factual basis for his plea may admit that he is committed a felony murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.189" offset="536116">The judge is not to make any determination as to the degree of the crime rather the judge has complete discretion to impose any sentence which to him appears appropriate, however, if that same defendant goes to trial on the same facts and is convicted of first degree murder then he must receive the mandatory life sentence and this case of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.627" offset="641860">Mr. Corbitt did go to trial in a felony murder case and he was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.874" offset="662862">Therefore, he had to receive the mandatory life sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="207.340" offset="932760">However, the judge indicated that he was powerless to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="252.541" offset="1113527">Well, I think there's a clear distinction to be made between this case and in Bordenkircher.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.180" offset="1132126">Bordenkircher was dealing with the practice of plea bargaining and this Court held that a defendant who engages in plea bargaining and turns down a plea bargain is not penalize for asserting his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.945" offset="1191163">In New Jersey, a defendant who refuses to enter a non vult plea in a murder case but instead goes to trial is penalize for asserting his rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="301.868" offset="1310804">Well, in Bordenkircher, I think the answer to that is simply the prosecutor could've proceeded on habitual offender indictment at the very beginning so the defendant was eligible for a sentence of life imprisonment on the day that he was first indited as it were he start paid no penalty because he ultimately was sentence to life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.492" offset="1405367">Mr. Corbitt of course, could've receive a much lesser sentence had he plead non vult and because he was denied these sentencing alternatives when he was convicted to trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="924.420" offset="3801004">It works in robbery cases, in kidnapping cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.241" offset="3816364">It works for any other crime that one could mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.279" offset="3828485">There is no reason to believe that this sort of unique sentencing scheme therefore is necessary in anyway to conduct plea bargaining rather it is unnecessary as this Court said in United States versus Jackson, “It is unnecessary and therefore excessive.”</text>
            <text syncTime="950.184" offset="3904136">As I've indicated previously, the statute is not analogous to the process of plea bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.643" offset="3929945">First of all, as I've said before, it's not a voluntary process and secondly it does not contain the mutuality of advantage which is commonly found in plea bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.735" offset="3970278">The defendant's aim in a plea bargaining is always to reduce his maximum possible exposure on a crime and there's of course any number of ways that this can be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.463" offset="4013223">But a defendant who pleads non vult in New Jersey does not limit his maximum possible exposure for he's still eligible for the life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.638" offset="4049899">The only thing that defendant achieves by pleading non vult is that he insulates himself from the possibility of the mandatory life sentence which comes upon a jury conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.181" offset="4104129">Therefore, we would submit that this murder statute is nothing more than a unilateral penalty imposed upon those persons who have exercised their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.503" offset="4149373">I recognize that a defendant in a criminal proceeding is often times called upon to make difficult choices but the threshold question has always been thus compelling an election between two alternatives impair to any appreciable extent the underlying right involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.758" offset="4230353">And I think I've demonstrated that this New Jersey murder statute does in fact deter defendants from exercising their constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.464" offset="4265253">In a number of cases, this Court has had the opportunity to consider the concept of vindictiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.501" offset="4297331">It is been held that a defendant may not be vindictively penalize for exercising a right and we submit that this is exactly what the New Jersey murder statute does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.307" offset="4344560">It requires that the defendant who insists upon his rights must receive the maximum sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.988" offset="4367339">This is no different than a judge that would announce that it's his policy to impose the maximum sentence on any defendant, who dares come before him in a jury trial and he is convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.407" offset="4416972">Thus, as I've indicated in the final analysis, this statute unnecessarily deters the right to jury trial while penalizing those defendants who insist upon the rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.913" offset="4463052">If I may move on to my equal protection argument, as I've indicated before, there are two scales of punishment for first degree murder in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.633" offset="4501922">This classification is not based in anyway on the personal or penal status of the offender but rather solely upon whether he has exercised his right to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.143" offset="4551973">It does not matter whether the defendant is a young man or an old man or whether he has no prior conviction so as a habitual offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.363" offset="4584782">Rather the first decision that the sentencing judge must make in this sort of case is whether the defendant has exercise his right to a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.609" offset="4625847">If the defendant has been convicted upon a non vult plea, then the judge of course has complete discretion to impose almost any sentence between probation and life imprisonment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1187.925" offset="4855097">I would think that there would still be a defect in that and that even if a defendant waive the jury that the -- he would still be eligible for a wide range of sentences upon a non vult plea while he would still have to receive the maximum penalty upon a conviction whether it'd be a judge conviction or a jury conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.400" offset="4953004">I have no objection to the concept of extending leniency towards those persons who admit their guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.541" offset="4981530">But this provides no justification whatsoever for imposing the maximum sentence on a defendant simply because he has exercised his rights to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.479" offset="5021236">It maybe that in certain cases, a judge as a matter of his own discretion will feel that a defendant who has admitted his guilt is more emendable to rehabilitation, but it does not logically follow that the defendant who has insisted upon his constitutional rights must be so incorrigible that only the maximum sentence would be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.066" offset="5123636">In this case, we are simply asking that the defendant having insisted upon his right to a jury trial be eligible for the same range of penalties that he would've been admitted his guilt through a non vult plea.</text>

            <text syncTime="1644.916" offset="6683042">The issue presented by this case is whether the New Jersey statutory sentencing scheme for murder impermissible infringes upon a defendant's Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.556" offset="6725569">A subsidiary question is whether the statutory scheme at issue deprives an accused of equal protection of he laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.507" offset="6757439">It is our position that New Jersey's homicide statute deny in anyway burden those wishing to exercise their Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to defend against murder charges before a jury nor do our statutes deprive those individuals of equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.451" offset="6821177">At the outset, we recognize and emphasize that if the sole objective and result of state legislation is to unnecessarily discourage the assertion of constitutional rights then the statutory scheme is patently unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.681" offset="6890141">However, this case involves nothing more than a statutory codification of plea bargaining in homicide cases and nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.683" offset="6934131">Even assuming any form of an inducement this Court has held that there is no chilling effect on the exercise of constitutional rights when three criteria have been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.141" offset="6987943">One, the statutory scheme serves a necessary and legitimate state interest and/or interest to a defendant which is present here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2744.980" offset="11083316">What this might help -- what I do want to emphasize, and perhaps, I haven't up to this point is the fact that there is no right upon the part of the defendant to have his non vult plea accepted by the judge at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2756.728" offset="11130232">The judge does it, a discretionary act with the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.359" offset="11140786">If he looks at the facts of this case as you've indicated for actual basis must be laid in New Jersey otherwise a plea cannot be accepted which is different from the Alfred type situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.793" offset="11178506">In New Jersey, the factual predicate must be laid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.415" offset="11189060">When the judge sees those facts, he might determine not to accept the plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.208" offset="11204211">Base upon, let us say the prosecutor recommends 25 years and the judge will think to himself that that just is a little too easy visibly the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.566" offset="11257605">Also significant is the fact that in New Jersey under our present statutory scheme, the benefits of it are unavailable, are unobtainable by other means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.022" offset="11295431">Elimination of the mandatory life sentence would nullify the legislative determination that they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.388" offset="11316955">That is the appropriate penalty for first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.614" offset="11333778">Abolition of the non vult plea would have a detrimental effect on defendants who wish to acknowledge their guilt and to properly avail themselves of less harsh treatment by immediately commencing the rehabilitation process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.969" offset="11383202">Thus, in our view, the New Jersey statutory scheme does not place an excessive burden or in fact any burden upon a defendants right to plead not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.383" offset="11420923">Moreover, the scheme is justifying necessary and legitimate state needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.861" offset="11438791">We recognize that no man should receive an additional penalty because he defends against the charge but it does not follow that one who acknowledges his guilt should not be given consideration on that account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.035" offset="11491558">I will now briefly turn to the equal protection argument raised in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.059" offset="11515591">It is our view that the equal protection argument does -- the issue as to equal protection does not exist in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.293" offset="11544534">If there is an unconstitutional compulsion placed upon a defendant's Fifth and/or Sixth Amendment rights, this case would of course be dispose off on Jackson grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.315" offset="11592600">If there is no constitutional impediment then it follows that the equal protection argument would equally be meritless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.041" offset="11623528">We submit that the category in New Jersey at the time where the decision whether to proceed to trial or to plead non vult, the category is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.415" offset="11657070">You have one category that is indited murderous and they all have the identical choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.924" offset="11679117">And so, therefore, there is no equal protection argument at that point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.859" offset="11698761">If the appellant argues that the classes do not come into existence subsequent to conviction, which I believe appellant does argue, that also must fall because at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.252" offset="11744423">We have two classes, we do not have one but two classes and they are those people who have been convicted of murder and those people who have been convicted of first degree murder for which the legislature determine a life imprisonment penalty and so that under either alternative or theory, the equal protection argument would be non-existing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.851" offset="11822791">Lastly, even assuming a cognizable class for purposes of the equal protection argument, in our view the argument must fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.539" offset="11865527">We have it in New Jersey a legitimate and indeed compelling state interest in fostering the statutory scheme which we have mentioned here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.853" offset="11902830">These are to repeat, amelioration of the rigors of life imprisonment, recognition of the rehabilitative prospects by one going to admit his guilt, the ability to avoid trial, facilitation of plea negotiations, the conservation of scarce judicial and prosecutorial resources, and prompt the position of a punishment of offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.242" offset="11992377">Suffice it to say, the benefits included by defendants in the state demonstrate that the equal protection argument is meritless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.577" offset="12021635">Thank you for your attention to our argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="2988.800" offset="12058624">Your Honor, I'd like to make just one quick point that being that a defendant in New Jersey of course cannot plead to the offense of first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.622" offset="12093837">Pleads are not accepted to either first degree or second degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.813" offset="12110660">Now, the state before the New Jersey Supreme Court made the same argument that basically there was a difference between any conviction for first degree murder and the conviction for murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.414" offset="12152978">And in New Jersey Supreme Court held then I'm reading from page 33 of the appendix that we do not accept their position as a fully satisfied rebases for meeting the defendant's argument which it seems to us can and should be dealt with more directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.439" offset="12217135">I think therefore that the opinion of the New Jersey Supreme Court does not revolve on this matter of statutory construction but it was decided upon the constitutional principles upon the assumption that the person who pleads non vult for murder and admits a felony murder is in fact in the same position as the person who is convicted of a felony murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.644" offset="12313997">Thank you very much.</text>
