            <label>Mr. Calvin W. Breit</label>
            <text syncTime="70.635" offset="385964">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.040" offset="399548">This matter comes on out of the Fourth Circuit arising out of a decision which was then in conflict with the Ninth and now with the Second and Fifth Circuits as well concerning the rights of a longshoreman who was injured aboard the defendant's vessel as a result of the combined negligence of the longshoreman himself, the stevedore, and the shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.839" offset="538728">The major issue before the Court is whether or not the longshoreman has a right to recover in full his damages under the longest established common law principal of joint and several liability from the various tortfeasors who caused his harm or whether that right has been abrogated by statute under the Longshoreman and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.135" offset="671953">The history of the right in both maritime and land-based law is extensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.344" offset="696717">This Court has ruled in Halcyon versus Haenn.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.029" offset="715525">It is ruled in Pope and Talbot versus Hawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.630" offset="729840">It is more recently ruled in Cooper versus Fritz Kopke.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.980" offset="759306">In ACL versus Uri (ph), numerous other cases that the injured party has an indivisible right of recovery in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.679" offset="818134">The question now posed is whether Congress intended to abrogate that rule when it amended the Longshoreman and Harbor Workers Compensation Act in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.692" offset="874141">Prior to 1972, it was clear that Halcyon and versus Haenn, Pope and Talbot versus Hawn, was the law on that particular issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.464" offset="917191">Congress made no act which would suggest that it intended to change that law.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.165" offset="951986">There is apparent but not actual discrepancy between two sentences in 905 (d) of the Act which has been taken to suggest that the Congress was intending proportionate fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.203" offset="1028159">Nothing could have been further from Congress' mind at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.594" offset="1049788">Respondent in page 11 of his brief concedes that the purpose of the second sentence of 905 (b) was intended to preserve the doctrine established by this Court in Reed versus Yaka namely that a shipowner could not by hiring his own longshoreman and thus become the stevedore avoid the harm that he does of that stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.819" offset="1182699">It was in the context of Reed versus Yaka that the second sentence was passed in the 1972 Amendment and the purpose of it was solely to retain the doctrine as espoused by this Court in Reed versus Yaka.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.039" offset="1255528">On page 43 and 44 of respondent's brief, it is suggested that 933 of this same Act was passed so that the longshoreman could not effect a double recovery and received double compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.978" offset="1323238">Well, it's inconceivable that he could have received double compensation unless in the first instance, he is compensated in full by the shipowner tortfeasor who has caused his harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.314" offset="1388648">An appellee in the Second Circuit, Anderson versus Iceland on the first both have stated that the purpose of that sentence in 905 (b) was to preserve the doctrine of Reed versus Yaka.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.299" offset="1452596">But more important than that Congress itself was not silent on the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.036" offset="1471509">Congress specifically stated that the longshoreman's right of action in negligence against the shipowner shall survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.208" offset="1520201">Now, that right of action against the shipowner is the right to recover 100% of his damages from the shipowner or any other person who independently or concurrently created the harm that he has suffered.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.057" offset="1595643">The congressional record is replete of literally dozens of cases that it intended to overrule that were in existence at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.202" offset="1640155">This Court in an active role which it is permitted to do in matters of maritime under the doctrine of Seas Shipping versus Sieracki provided for the longshoreman a cause of action which created in effect an absolute right of recovery for any unseaworthy condition regardless of fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.278" offset="1752482">Interestingly enough, the seaworthy condition, the unseaworthy condition was almost always cause by the negligence of the stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.789" offset="1794487">The Court had held in Halcyon versus Haenn that there was no cause of action over against the stevedore for contribution in tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.893" offset="1830954">And this Court then went on to extend the Seas doctrine under a contract theory when in Ryan it held that there is not contribution but indemnity.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.515" offset="1893439">The Congress spent a great deal of time on those issues and in doing so in its reports, it clearly established when it was intending to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.821" offset="1970657">It set forth specifically the names of the cases that it intended to overrule particularly under the section of elimination of unseaworthiness remedy it cites Sea Shipping versus Sieracki as one of the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.399" offset="2037008">It intended to overrule.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.283" offset="2044531">No longer does the longshoreman have a cause of action merely because he was injured and merely because there was a defective condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.626" offset="2081834">He now is reduced to the common law negligence action instead of an action under unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.975" offset="2111300">The court went on, rather Congress went on further to suggest further and then reciting Ryan Stevedoring versus Pan-Atlantic.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.759" offset="2154454">The third party action, the tripartite cause of litigation which had burdened the courts and had expended large sums of money by the stevedore and his carrier ownership on alike is better put to use paying compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.495" offset="2225403">And so Ryan was specifically overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.463" offset="2241181">(Inaudible) Italia Society versus Oregon Stevedoring, all cases which had established the cause of action for unseaworthiness was specifically overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.720" offset="2298232">And finally, under the same suggestion, elimination of unseaworthy remedy -- unseaworthiness remedy we finally come to the sentence which is the crux of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.024" offset="2351417">The vessel will not be chargeable with the negligence of the stevedore or employees of the stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.046" offset="2383600">Respondent and the Fourth Circuit, I suggest erroneously have interpreted that statement to mean that a percentage of negligence requires only a percentage of payment when in fact what was intended here by the vessel not being chargeable with the negligence of the stevedore was to do away with Seas Shipping which said that in effect, the shipowner is vicariously responsible for the acts of the stevedore and thus becomes liable when the stevedore commits an acts on negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.868" offset="2546813">Today, under the amendments, the Act of negligence must be committed by the shipowner himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.233" offset="2580355">But that does not mean that they cannot be more than one proximate cause of an injury and nowhere was it intended by Congress that the shipowner would become liable in tort if it were the sole and exclusive tortfeasor.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.168" offset="2656005">To suggest that is to defeat the purpose of the Act and as Congress has said to cause to the shipowner to remain responsible to his obligations in tort to the injured longshoreman.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="656.129" offset="2727894">So, Mr. Breit supposing this case had originate had risen interstate common law tort situation and the trial court have mistakenly submitted interrogatories regarding comparative fault to the jury and they found 20% in one party, 7% on the other, it goes the highest court as the highest court of the state says the trial court was wrong we don't have comparative fault, we just have traditional, ordinary negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.269" offset="2832488">Could it uphold a verdict against the 20% liable party for the entire amount?</text>

            <label>Mr. Calvin W. Breit</label>
            <text syncTime="688.881" offset="2858924">If we are talking about comparative fault of others besides the injured person, clearly, under every case that has ever been decided, it must give that injured person 100% of the recovery with the exception of those states which have incorporated into a statute under the doctrine of comparative negligence, under the common law doctrine of ordinary negligence both land and maritime, the injured person always was entitled to the whole because his harm is indivisible even though two or three or four may have cause to contribute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.236" offset="3004270">The broken leg is the broken leg and if three people concurrently aided in breaking it, he still has one harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.434" offset="3037080">And so, my answer to you sir is that every case has always held that the injured party is entitled to the full recovery at common law.</text>

            <text syncTime="751.457" offset="3109177">That law had paid it anyway?</text>

            <text syncTime="754.629" offset="3121925">Mr. Justice Marshall, I have argued in my brief that the ultimate economic loss is going to be shared between the stevedore and the shipowner somehow or other in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.732" offset="3166333">But the sole purpose that we're here is because they are both in concert suggesting that the injured person suffered the economic loss and he is the least able to bear that loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.618" offset="3217847">You are correct sir, regardless of this Court's ruling provided it gives the injured longshoreman his full recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.493" offset="3257344">Sooner or later in the course of dealing between the stevedore and the shipowner, the cost will be passed on to the shipowner and the ultimate consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.867" offset="3298826">No question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.396" offset="3304991">The issue then is, do we take it away from the injured party so that their respective losses are less.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.211" offset="3332263">Common law doesn't permit that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1500.959" offset="6107199">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.315" offset="6128619">The question before the Court for determination, it seems to me is one of fairness inequity and as well or not a shipowner which has been found by jury to the only 20% at fault for an accident shall be required to pay full damages to the plaintiff while the stevedore employer found to be 70% at fault recovers the full amount of its compensation lien and thus shares none of the financial burden of the loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.547" offset="6269576">Now, I think it's important to understand or consider what the Congress was trying to do in adopting the 1972 amendments to the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.503" offset="6333419">It's clear that they acted in order to correct the number of inequities which I developed over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.908" offset="6371035">Primarily of course, it was to provide a liberal system of compensation for longshoreman, the injured parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.593" offset="6409697">But secondarily, it was certainly to more equally distribute the financial burden occasioned by an accident among the three parties involved, the longshoreman himself, the shipowner and the stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.053" offset="6471555">And I think here, it's important to recognize what had happened under litigation which had developed under the Longshoreman's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.183" offset="6516067">And Mr. Breit has referred to the Sieracki case and the Ryan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.869" offset="6534875">And it had developed as you know that longshoreman were given the warranty of seaworthiness and could recover against the vessel owner not only for negligence but for unseaworthiness which in effect almost made the shipowner an insurer for the safety of the longshoreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.553" offset="6617631">In order to correct this inequity or in an attempt to the Ryan doctrine allowed the shipowner to claim back over against the stevedoring company for indemnity and the stevedore ended up in that type of three-party litigation by not only paying compensation but by paying full damages assessed by jury or the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.811" offset="6726614">This was recognized by everyone as being quite inequitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.597" offset="6749811">If you adopt the position of the plaintiff petitioner in this case, we are going right back to the same old inequity except it now falls on the shipowner instead of on the stevedoring company and I don't believe as Judge Haynsworth stated in his opinion that it was ever the intent of the Congress while taking away on the one hand the right of the shipowner to recover any indemnity from the stevedoring company to then settle the shipowner with full liability for an accident when it may well have been only slightly at fault and the stevedoring company greatly at fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.410" offset="6948968">This was not the intent of the Congress as shown by the legislative history and could not have been we contend in light of the historical background of the 19 -- of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act as existed prior to 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.499" offset="7033396">Now, there was also one other intention of the Congress I believe in the 1972 Amendments and that was to provide a liberal compensation scheme whereby the longshoreman could look to the Act to compensation for full satisfaction for his injuries and would not have to file a third party action against anyone except on unusual circumstances in order to recover compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.415" offset="7172995">The result as suggested by the petitioner would do away with this intention of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.190" offset="7216149">Now, the decision of the Fourth Circuit, the en banc decision serves to further the proxies of the amendments by balancing the equities among the three parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.864" offset="7262856">As this decision has indicated, the shipowner will pay its proportionate fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.678" offset="7294098">In this case, the jury found there were 20% at fault for the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.735" offset="7314265">The longshoreman recovers not only his statutory benefits under the Act which this case serves to show a quite liberal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.225" offset="7352299">He's already received in excess of $50,000.00 in compensation payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.910" offset="7371003">But in addition, he will recover the 20% liability damages which the jury has said are attributable to the shipowner.</text>

            <text syncTime="3076.785" offset="12410546">Because if you read them literally, it would indicate that if the longshoreman is employed by independent contractor to provide stevedoring services and if there is any negligence on the part of the of the vessel owner then he recovers a 100% whereas if you read the second and third sentences that way, you find that if he's employed by the shipowner to run the stevedoring services in any fault of the stevedoring -- people providing stevedoring services cause the accident he recovers nothing and I don't think that anyone could contend that the Congress intended to do that and the only way to reconcile the two sentences is to read them to mean to the extent the injury was caused by the fault of the vessel or the fault of the stevedoring people employed to render stevedoring services and if you read it that way, it is entirely consistent and also consistent with the language of the Act in the legislative history which indicates that they shall not be responsible for acts or omission of the stevedore.</text>

            <label>Mr. Calvin W. Breit</label>
            <text syncTime="3286.966" offset="13251271">One very brief comment, I realize it is beyond the normal time for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.275" offset="13272482">In Cooper versus Stevedoring in 1974, this Court held that Halcyon versus Haenn was still good law under the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.215" offset="13308217">Those facts were identical in all respects with the case here, a stevedore who is immune from suit of by the injured party and sues the shipowner and recovers in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.419" offset="13369031">There is no contribution in tort from the immune employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.578" offset="13389720">The statute intended to keep that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.492" offset="13401318">When the statute said that the employer shall not be liable to the vessel for such damages, directly or indirectly and in any agreements, the warrants of the contrary shall be void.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.352" offset="13456802">It was specifically intended by Congress regardless of the equities as argued here that the stevedore not play a part in the tort action or not suffer contribution by waiving what would normally be the lien that it should recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.056" offset="13531617">And in exchange for that, the stevedores have paid two, three, and sometimes four times as much in weekly compensation as they did before the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.977" offset="13575293">They give what was a relatively small payment and tripartite litigation and got in exchange higher payments but absolutely no litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.891" offset="13634957">That was the purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.005" offset="13643421">And if we follow the Fourth Circuit, we must then implead the stevedore in this case and in every case to find out what is the percentage of their fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.426" offset="13685112">This was an ex parte determination of 70% in which they played no part or hearing and clearly if they were there, advocating their position, as they must do under the Fourth Circuit in every other case from hereon in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.150" offset="13739969">They become a party to the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.088" offset="13747702">It's exactly what Congress was intending to avoid.</text>

            <text syncTime="3414.509" offset="13761390">What do have to say about whether this case might be back here could conceivably be back here after the District Court acts?</text>

            <label>Mr. Calvin W. Breit</label>
            <text syncTime="3421.534" offset="13789497">If the Court rules that the longshoreman is entitled to his common-law remedy of 100% recovery from the shipowner which we have espouse and which the other circuits have held then no one will ever be back here because he will be required to repay his lien to the stevedore and receive a credit against future compensation which may be payable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.227" offset="13896286">We don't know now what the lien is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.257" offset="13904436">We may never know what the lien is until this man dies because it's an ongoing lien and each year it's subject to change under a formula device by Congress geared to inflation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.445" offset="13961174">So that each year, his formula changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.083" offset="13975698">We suggest that there would be no further litigation except if this Court says that the Fourth Circuit is correct and we have to go now under the District Court and fight over the distribution and then every case thereafter will have to be fought with the stevedore involved to determine whether they are 70, 60, 50 or 30% at fault and Congress did not intend it.</text>
