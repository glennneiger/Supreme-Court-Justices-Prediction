            <label>Ms. Eileen F. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="50.376" offset="304880">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.459" offset="309164">This habeas corpus proceeding presents two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.232" offset="324315">The first issue is waiver and the second is the constitutionality of the New York State evidentiary presumption, which provides with certain exceptions, that presence in an automobile of any of the weapons enumerated in the statute is presumptive evidence of its possession by all persons occupying the automobile at the time that the weapon is found.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.965" offset="419192">The threshold question here is whether respondents have preserved the question of the statute’s constitutionality or habeas corpus review, considering that respondents failed to object at trail to a jury instruction, which only partially explained the statute and again failed to object either at trail or on their state appeals to the constitutionality of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.917" offset="539042">A consideration of both the facts of this case and the applicable law compelled to finding that respondents have indeed failed to preserve any substitutive constitutional claim for collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.019" offset="595466">The facts in this case are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.276" offset="608528">The respondents and a 16 year-old girl, who was later adjudicated as a youthful offender, and was therein after referred to as Jane Doe, were riding in a car on the New York State Thruway in upstate Ulster County, when they were stopped for speeding through work zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.152" offset="692015">The driver, respondent Lemmons, produced a license and a registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.116" offset="715839">A radio check was made and it was determined that he was wanted on a Michigan fugitive warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.287" offset="744469">He was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.178" offset="752097">One of the policemen, one trooper Askew returned to the vehicle, looked in through the right front passenger window and detected protruding from a ladies handbag, Jane Doe’s handbag, on the floor of the front seat of the car, a .45 automatic pistol.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="183.483" stopTime="185.945">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="183.483" offset="837256">Is it clear that it was Jane Doe's handbag?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eileen_f_shapiro" startTime="185.945" stopTime="301.676">
            <label>Ms. Eileen F. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="185.945" offset="847182">Yes Your Honor, it is clear, there is no dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.674" offset="862020">He reached in, removed that gun, which turned out to be fully loaded, I believe with modified hollow point bullets and found underneath that gun a second gun, a .38 Smith &amp; Wesson revolver, also fully loaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.758" offset="942373">The officer placed all three of the remaining occupants of the car under arrest and then attempted to enter the trunk of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.971" offset="995244">The trunk key was not recovered on any of the respondents, it was not in the car and so when the car was returned to the barracks, the trunk was pried open and the police found therein a pound-and-a-half of heroin and a .45 caliber spitfire machine gun, also loaded with 27 rounds of ammunition.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.949" offset="1095137">All four of the passengers were indicted on three counts of felonious weapons possession and one count of narcotics possession, a charge which in New York at that time bore a potential life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.397" offset="1164936">They -- as the record clearly shows, all the parties, the respondents and Jane Doe noted a cooperative defense although they were individually represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.671" offset="1218017">In particular, respondents directed their aspect of the defense toward rebutting the articles in the trunk of the car, the heroin count and the machine gun count and Doe’s counsel Mr. Goldberg, who parenthetically is representing respondents in this proceeding, directed his attention toward the handguns in the car.</text>

            <text syncTime="307.736" offset="1334314">As a co-defendant and it was not until sentencing that the trial judge set aside her conviction, adjudicated her a youthful offender.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="316.656" offset="1369945">So there were four co-defendants in this case?</text>

            <label>Ms. Eileen F. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="318.163" offset="1376005">Absolutely, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.309" offset="1392619">At the course of the people’s case, the respondents and Jane Doe made a routine pro forma motion to dismiss, which in New York is rarely granted as jeopardy may often attach, should the motion be erroneously granted and then on appeal it cannot be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.298" offset="1492616">The respondents’ motion in particular was directed toward the fact that as the handguns were in Jane Doe’s handbag, they were on her person under the meaning of the statutory presumption at issue and thus they could not be held responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.211" offset="1584253">The trial court agreeing with the District’s attorney found that the location of the guns, since they were not actually in Jane Doe’s pocket or whatever, was presented in fact of the jury and thus he denied their motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.597" offset="1645798">In fact, respondents Hardrick and Allen even appear to concede in that motion, which is reproduced on page 17 of the Appendix, then in fact, the judge may have been right that it is a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.114" offset="1711835">At the close of the entire case all counsels adjoined in moving to dismiss the machine gun and heroin charges against Jane Doe.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.212" offset="1752168">In other words, Jane Doe’s lawyer made the motion and counsel for the three respondents piped up and said, yes Your Honor, we think you ought to grant Jane Doe’s motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.994" offset="1803368">At summation, Doe’s lawyer placed great emphasis on the large caliber of the handguns, the weight of the guns, which amount to approximately 6 pounds, the size of the guns and in particular the position of the guns in the handbag, they were positioned crosswise so as to keep the handbag open.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.493" offset="1889364">To support his position that the respondents tossed the guns in the bag at the time that the car -- either at the time the car was flagged down by the police or in the interval when the driver was being arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.053" offset="1947564">Respondents Allen and Hardrick on the other hand placed great emphasis on the absent trunk key and the fact that the car had been borrowed that very morning from respondent Lemmon’s brother in Rochester, New York, approximately 250 miles away from the site of the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.957" offset="2023215">And then in unmistakable language in their submission, these respondents Allen and Hardrick virtually conceded their guilt on the handgun charges.</text>

            <text syncTime="517.544" offset="2173576">This is what Mr. Toraka, counsel for Allen and Hardrick said to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.466" offset="2201266">If you are living under their times and conditions and you travel from a big city, Detroit, to a bigger city, New York City, it is not unusual for people to carry guns, small-arms to protect themselves, is it?</text>
            <text syncTime="539.240" offset="2260302">There are places in New York City policemen fear to go, which you have got to understand you are sitting here as jurors, these are people live flesh and blood the same as you, different motives, different objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.393" offset="2312965">And he went on to say that small arms were in the pocket-book, it is true, the question is who do they belong to?</text>
            <text syncTime="561.163" offset="2348074">If you think that Hardrick and Allen had exercised dominion control over the weapons in the purse and follow the law as the judge gives it to you on the presumption of what was in the purse as to all 4 or 3 or 2 or 1 and I think that this cannot be mistaken as anything other than a concession on those charges.</text>

            <text syncTime="1226.243" offset="5008384">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.281" offset="5048508">Respondents -- I have just discussed the New York Court of Appeals’ opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.273" offset="5072436">I would like to say that at no stage in the federal or state proceedings, did the respondents give a reason for their failure to object.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.495" offset="5117367">In fact, it is not until their brief to this Court that they suggest for the first time that the reason might be inadvertence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.255" offset="5156342">However, I would like to say that far being inadvertence, the record below lies in inadvertence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.103" offset="5187793">The record shows that the respondents knew the presumption would be charged, expected it to be charged, that they had a specific strategy and the specific strategy they had was to deflect pressure away from Jane Doe on the handgun charges, so that Jane Doe, a 16-year-old with no prior record and everything to gain and virtually nothing to lose would not testify against them and that is indeed what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.342" offset="5328750">The respondents give their entire defense away from putting pressure on Jane Doe, away from pointing an accusatory finger at Jane Doe and in fact the part of Allen and Hardrick’s charge that I quoted to to the Court indicates that they were virtually conceding those counts rather than have Jane Doe testify on the serious life sentence charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.491" offset="5457377">And I say this also because it seems unlikely that counsel, who had so successfully defended these respondents on the drug charge; this was actually by any standard a very successful defense, would have been unlikely, particularly since they knew about everything that was going to happen at the jury charge period, would be unlikely to overlook such an important feature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.011" offset="5579421">And there is also possibly another explanation for this waiver, which may come to mind and that is that these respondents were in a sense willing to accept a compromise verdict to allow the jury to convict them on the lesser charges in the hopes of getting an acquittal on their life sentence charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.658" offset="5657997">And of course, respondents have a burden for coming forward with a good cause, mere inadvertence does not satisfy the Wainwright v. Sykes standard, but if either of the theories that I have proposed to the Court is supported by the record and I believe they are, these respondents have failed to even meet the Fay v. Noia standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.921" offset="5783071">If notwithstanding the respondents’ waiver, the court nevertheless considers the constitutionality of the presumption, the state submits the statute as constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.918" offset="5839078">The statute is a carefully drafted statute, which embodies legislative recognition that illegal handguns and automobiles are closely linked with the commission of violent crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.446" offset="5889128">The presumption provides that presence in a private automobile an illegal weapon is presumptive evidence of its possession by all the occupants of the car unless one of the exceptions applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.642" offset="5937925">There are three exceptions; there is the on the person exception, which this case involves, there is an exception where possession will not be imputed to a taxi cab driver, if a gun is found in the car and the third exception is if one of the occupants of the car not present under duress has a valid license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.717" offset="6026219">There are also approximately 15 exemptions, which are contained in another statute 265.20 of the penal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.348" offset="6056730">And persons -- these exemptions are the persons, who voluntarily surrender handguns for example, or manufacturers, shippers, other legitimate firearms’ holders or owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.352" offset="6116812">The elements of the car and the felonious weapons possession, which respondents state quite accurately in their petition for the habeas corpus in paragraphs five and six, is a knowing and voluntary possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.486" offset="6173341">The requisite metal state must be proved by evidence independent of the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.310" offset="6204583">Moreover, New York has a very liberal definition of constructive possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.851" offset="6230810">The weapons must be within the immediate control and reach of the accused and where it is available for his unlawful use if he so desires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.204" offset="6264142">So thus once the requisite mental state of knowing involuntary possession is established through other evidence, the presumption simply permits, a jury can infer an individual and close proximity to weapon, has that weapon within his immediate reach and control, thus it merely of course the evidence, its natural prohibitive force in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.653" offset="6369991">In this case -- in such a case rather, the relationship between the proved fact and the presumed fact is so close that it must satisfy any test this Court deems appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.701" offset="6418160">And I referred to the beyond the reasonable doubt test, which is really not that different from the (Inaudible) test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.801" offset="6454627">Finally, the statute focuses on narrowly defined conduct, presence in a private automobile, as the case has showed the presumption is applied in a principle way by the New York courts, on a case-by-case basis taking every variable into consideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="2630.988" offset="10627323">We submit as the Second Circuit found that the New York Court of Appeals did not expressly address the constitutional issue because that it decided it in so many previous cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2658.655" offset="10737977">So, in other words, the New York Court of Appeals in essence said, we have decided 15 times already that this statute is constitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2669.783" offset="10782490">All we are going to do is note that this presumption has a pressing need that it was enacted because of certain problems dealing with criminal justice and now we are going to go on and address the problem that troubled the appellate division dissenters.</text>
