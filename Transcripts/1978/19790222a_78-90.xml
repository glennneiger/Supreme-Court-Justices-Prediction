            <text syncTime="24.005" offset="200370">The question involved is whether the Louisiana constitutional provision for trial by a jury of six persons in certain criminal cases with five required to deliver a verdict meets our offense, the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.512" offset="278424">In the Louisiana Constitution of 1974 which is now in service, we have three categories for our criminal juries.</text>

            <text syncTime="102.446" offset="514152">Specifically they were alleged to have shown obscene movies in a coin-operated machine in downtown New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.837" offset="551769">There were two charges, two convictions and Burch was convicted and sentenced to two seven month terms of imprisonment which were suspended.</text>

            <text syncTime="153.307" offset="717594">There if the court will recall, this Court determined that for the first time that a defendant was entitled to a jury in a serious criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.520" offset="750508">In Duncan's case, the maximum sentence could've been imposed under the statute was two years.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.580" offset="822711">And I'm saying it by analogy as in Duncan, the case of Duncan there the State of Louisiana argued that since Duncan in fact received the sentence which was not in legal terminology of serious sentence, he should not be permitted to argue his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.031" offset="876523">Nonetheless the court did reach the merits on that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="226.661" offset="1011001">However there's no question but that Burch who was convicted by a five to one vote is properly here whether or not Russel should be considered by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.710" offset="1059276">Our argument is essentially that the combination of the non-unanimity and the reduced panel -- offense, the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, this Court has said in Williams versus Florida that six out of six is constitutional, to that -- 1970 and in Ballew versus Georgia you said the five out five, offense, the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.634" offset="1186962">Now here we have a case where you have five out of six and the court must decide whether that model offense, the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.038" offset="1224579">I think it goes without saying in many of the arguments that we might use would apply to the Ballew decision, five out of five and many of the arguments that the state might make might apply with equal vigor to the Williams versus Florida decision regarding six out of six.</text>

            <text syncTime="1364.497" offset="5562368">Well, our position Your Honor is anchored right on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.782" offset="5579504">We have a six member jury and five of them brought back a verdict and that the defense in this case made no attempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.321" offset="5621718">I'd like to jump to an argument that was made during my predecessor's argument where it has appeared that the only - that the two horns of the dilemma were social studies on one side, judicial hunch on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.754" offset="5675426">It's the State of Louisiana's position that there's a third position and it's the only valuable position that is actual court studies taken -- which take place not grabbing fifteen cases here or some but with all the computers and everything available today it would be not impossible and not all that difficult to actually put into the computer every majority verdict to case in Louisiana compared to a light number of cases and other unanimous jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.095" offset="5788797">This has never been done although this Court suggested in Johnson versus Louisiana that until such evidence was presented it was not going to set aside the judicial -- the will of the Louisiana legislature in its presumption that a majority verdict was perfectly constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.403" offset="5869986">Now, let -- I'd like to point out to Mr. Justice Blackmun, I think he'll be particularly interested in this and I was particularly interested in it because of his reliance on empirical data in Ballew.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.292" offset="5925575">And I point out my brief that the data is sort of divided not completely but in general that on the same actual life studies of these majority verdicts or smaller jury's judicial proceedings favor the actual or in place studies generally favor these smaller juries and these majority verdicts where the mock juries and deductive modelling ones generally tend to disfavor them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.556" offset="6042603">I'd like to point out that coming right out right now are articles by Professor Bernard Grofman, Associate Professor of Social Scientist at the University of California, Irvine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.395" offset="6094012">He has brought one out in 19 -- at the end of last year the case for statistic for majority verdict, he's bringing more now right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.204" offset="6129225">By the way I -- just put in parenthesis, he's being funded in this by the National Science Foundation, its Social Sciences and Law Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.253" offset="6173424">He's been funded in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.819" offset="6179694">He's brought out the case statistical verdicts -- I mean, from majority for majority verdicts, the statistical case of majority verdicts and two other articles which he has sent to this Court barely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.386" offset="6225983">But anyway, the State of Louisiana does not want the court to rely on this but just nearly points out that even the -- that this statistical data professes are sharply divided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.927" offset="6288154">They'll -- Professor Stewart Niegel will tell you by all kind of formulas that this long and Xs and parenthesis that the chances of convicting an innocent person increase as you get five out of six whereas Professor Bernard Grofman will tell you by these other formulas, equally lined and complicated that his position that he urges in these articles and it's surprising anyway because it's counter-intuitive is that a six member majority verdict jury is more likely to protect the innocent than a 12 member unanimous verdict jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.910" offset="6428066">Now, I'm not telling this Court this because I urge them to rely on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.432" offset="6446143">I'm just telling them this to show them that the disarray that exist among this theoretical thinkers on the subject and our position is, if the National Science Foundation can fund a statistical research program like this, why can't they fund a naturally in place study of what actually happens in Louisiana under the majority verdict system that'll go on for maybe three or four years and collect actual hard figures.</text>
