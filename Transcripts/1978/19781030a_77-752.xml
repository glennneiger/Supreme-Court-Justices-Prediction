            <text syncTime="100.634" offset="505919">This case presents a question whether application of the National Labor Relations Act to Roman Catholic operated secondary schools were both secular and religious subjects are taught violates the Establishment Clause or the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.732" offset="602258">Respondents suggest the additional question, whether the National Labor Relations Act applies to private religious schools at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.278" offset="640502">Our reply brief incorrectly and inadvertently stated on page 1 or footnote 1 of page 2 that the employers did not present this issue before the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.020" offset="707480">We were partly in error, respondent, the Catholic Bishop of Chicago did not present this argument, but the respondent Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend, Inc. has statement in its brief that properly presented this issue to the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.448" offset="789191">And we apologize and raise the record to show that that issue is still before the court.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="187.204" offset="852198">So if we decided in your favor on the constitutional issue it might be appropriate to remand that to the Court of Appeals for decision in the first instance.</text>

            <label>Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="198.289" offset="896502">We believe that that issue is not a substantial issue and as we have endeavored to show in our reply brief, the Congress in amending the Act in 1974 to eliminate the exemption in Section 2 (2) for nonprofit hospitals, expressly approved the Board's policy of asserting jurisdiction over private, nonprofit organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.102" offset="1007783">And we believe the consistent legislative history shows no congressional intention to exempt nonprofit or religiously affiliated employers from the scope of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.676" offset="1070059">In this respect, the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the Act, and I quote, “clear on its face could not be understood to preclude jurisdiction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="257.701" offset="1134216">The facts maybe briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.164" offset="1144038">Respondent, the Catholic Bishop of Chicago, a corporation sole, operates two secondary schools for boys, Quigley North and Quigley South, which we refer to as the Quigleys.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.285" offset="1208508">These schools offer a secular curriculum in all respects, indistinguishable from the high school curriculum afforded by the public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.568" offset="1253648">But in addition, it also offers special religious training, along with its secular curriculum.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.935" offset="1291160">The admission requirements to the Quigleys are different from those of the public schools however.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.269" offset="1324492">The Quigleys initially admitted catholic boys who were recommended by their pastors as having expressed their desire to pursue their priesthood.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.954" offset="1375169">Subsequently, other catholic boys, also recommended by their pastors were allowed to matriculate, if their pastor believed that they had a potential for their priesthood, even though it had not been recognized or expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.665" offset="1462000">The full-time teachers at the Quigleys have contracts with the respondent, and the operating budgets of the Quigleys come within the monetary jurisdictional standards that the Board has established.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.350" offset="1520724">A million dollars in revenue in a given year and more than $65,000.00 worth of goods in a given year brought directly from out of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.949" offset="1563146">The Quigleys operate primarily, as the Board found, as college preparatory schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.434" offset="1605151">They are fully accredited by the state and by the North Central Accrediting Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.576" offset="1637648">They send however, a majority of their students to secular colleges.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.179" offset="1668054">As a matter of fact, their 1974 graduation class, only 16% went on to diocesan seminary college, Niles College.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.220" offset="1720299">The other respondent, the Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend, Inc. operates five high schools in 14 counties in North East Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.830" offset="1774738">These schools, like the Quigleys offer full program of college preparatory high schools subjects, and also include religious subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.102" offset="1827819">They differ from the Quigleys in this respect, the South Bend-Fort Wayne schools admit catholic boys who have not express the desire to pursue the priesthood or have the potential for their priesthood, and they also admit some non-Catholic students.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.721" offset="1922278">The South Bend-Forth Wayne schools also satisfy the Board's self-imposed monetary jurisdictional standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.730" offset="1966268">The faculties of these schools are interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.443" offset="1981106">The Quigleys employ a total of 76 full-time faculty persons of whom 46 are lay teachers, and so a clear majority of the Quigleys' faculty is a lay faculty.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.646" offset="2049964">The Fort Wayne-South Bend Diocese in 1974 employed a total faculty of 207 teacher, 182 of which were lay teachers, and of course only 25 affiliated with religious orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.364" offset="2124779">In September and October 1975, pursuant to separate representation petitions filed by the Quigley Education Association and the Community Alliance for Teachers of Catholic High School that has a felicitous acronym CATCH, elections were conducted in two units, both Quigleys combine four-unit, and the Fort Wayne-South Bend schools, five schools as a unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.693" offset="2246196">The unit was composed of all lay faculty and the unions won and were duly certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.167" offset="2276080">The employers refuse to bargain and the regional director issued complaints charging violations of 8 (a) (1) and (5).</text>
            <text syncTime="553.446" offset="2317145">And the employers admitted their refusal to bargain, because first that their schools were completely religious instead of religiously-affiliated which is a dichotomy that the Board has establish to determine whether it will exercise its jurisdiction over private religious schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="622.628" offset="2593834">For a number of years, the Board refrained from exercising jurisdiction at all over private schools, not just religious schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="2836.841" offset="11450702">When these schools come and compete for lay teachers, they're competing with the public school, and that's why I answered Mr. Justice Stevens questions concerning minimum wage.</text>
