            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll hear first this morning, Numbers 77-753 and the consolidated case, International Brotherhood of Teamsters against Daniel.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.929" offset="167058">Mr. Carmell, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sherman_carmell" startTime="20.496" stopTime="403.045">
            <label>Mr. Sherman Carmell</label>
            <text syncTime="20.496" offset="185344">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.278" offset="200495">In 1950, the respondent, John Daniel began employment under the jurisdiction of Teamsters Local 705.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.941" offset="235186">Five years later, Local 705 negotiated a contract which provided for the first time for a pension fund which is the Local 705 pension fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.252" offset="280430">In addition to being structured in accordance with Section 302 (c) (5) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, the basic features of the Local 705 pension fund were and are that it is a defined benefit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.346" offset="348766">It is non-contributory.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.135" offset="359946">It is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.947" offset="371127">Between December of 1960 and July of 1961, the fund record show no employment, covered employment for Mr. Daniel.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.999" offset="415326">In 1973, Mr. Daniel applied for a pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.751" offset="434343">After two hearings before the Boards of Trustees at which he appeared, the trustees denied his application for a pension based upon the break in service between December of '60 and July of 1961 as not meeting the fund's eligibility rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.707" offset="506232">As a result, Mr. Daniel filed and then amended a six-count complaint in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.030" offset="535489">Two of the counts, the first two which are before this Court were posited upon the Securities Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.842" offset="562761">Two counts were based upon Section 302 of the LMRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.395" offset="580942">One count alleged the breach duty of fair representation under Section 9 (a) of the NLRA and one count was a pendent jurisdiction claim for state common-law fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.889" offset="630888">The Local 705 petitioners moved to dismiss all of the counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.561" offset="649592">The District Court denied the motion to dismiss all of the counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.884" offset="666937">The case proceeded up on the counts I and II, the Securities Acts counts which are before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.840" offset="694732">In this posture, your -- may it please the Court, the case does not involve the merits of the Local 705 pension funds service rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.766" offset="734438">And although though the respondent in a discussion of ERISA at page 97 of his brief before this Court states, “To allow ERISA to preempt the antifraud provisions of the Federal Securities Laws would be to deny Daniel any relief whatsoever.”</text>
            <text syncTime="179.604" offset="821791">The respondent told the District Court at appendix 152 (a), “That even if the Security counts should be challenged or reversed on appeal, I feel that the other counts would be viable.”</text>
            <text syncTime="194.425" offset="881037">The result of reversal in this case then would be that proceedings would continue in the District Court under the two Section 302 counts, the duty -- the breech of the duty of fair representation and state law common fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.168" offset="940074">Please the Court, I wish to direct my arguments to the differences which may be found between the Securities Acts and the Labor statutes in the area of labor relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.727" offset="994304">The labor statutes as I refer to them are the National Labor Relations Act, the LMRA, the Welfare Pension Plan Disclosure Act and ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.674" offset="1042056">And when using the term labor relations, may it please the Court, I am not speaking only of union management or collectively bargain plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.080" offset="1079672">I am talking of the full spectrum of employer-employee relations that is, those pension plans which involved the relationship between an employer and an employee of which one is a collectively bargained pension plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.827" offset="1150725">The one consensus which I believe can be found from the mass of briefs among the Courts, the parties and the amici is that the legislative history and the provisions of the Securities Acts do not mention pension plans as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.936" offset="1211120">On the other hand and this is the point of our argument, the labor statutes beginning in 1935 and consistently through ERISA have discussed, considered, made discreet, cohesive and sometimes very detailed judgments as to the types of disclosure, as to the rights of actions of participants if any and as to the duties and obligations of plan trustees to the beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.708" offset="1362213">A review of the National Labor Relations Act, the Wagner Act was undertaken by the National Labor Relations Board in its seminal decision in Inland Steel which at 77 NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.016" offset="1415398">The Board after reviewing both senator -- the 1935 statute and the 1947 Amendments to that statute which would have changed the term other conditions of employment to a more narrow term working conditions stated that it was compelled to the conclusion and we find that matters affecting tenure of employment like the respondents, Inland Steels, retirement rule are within the statutory scope of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.582" offset="1553742">And the National Labor Relations Board found that the debates in 1947 over those proposed Amendments were “compelling evidence” that retirement plans were within the 1935 Acts intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.337" offset="1612675">The significance of this, may it please the Court, should not be lost because 1935 is the same chronological era that the 1933 and 1934 Security Acts were being put into law.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.403" offset="1676936">So in 1935, whereas the Security Acts said nothing, Congress was speaking distinctly to the issue under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="403.045" offset="1715597">Of course Mr. Carmell, not every retirement plan is a product of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.377" offset="1736913">We had one before us last term in Allied Structural Steel which was not at all a product of collective bargaining and therefore wouldn't have involved any of the rights and liabilities under the National Labor Relations Act or the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, isn't that correct?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sherman_carmell" startTime="427.746" stopTime="455.106">
            <label>Mr. Sherman Carmell</label>
            <text syncTime="427.746" offset="1814340">It is correct to that -- to the extent Your Honor that they all were not necessarily bargained for.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.840" offset="1838686">But with due respect, it is not correct to the extent that all pension plans were subjects for a collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.281" offset="1876511">That is 8 (5) of the old Act in 1935 Act, an 885 of the present Act, only refers to those -- only encompasses mandatory subjects for bargaining.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="455.106" stopTime="472.038">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="455.106" offset="1923845">If there -- but sometimes it's not even a collective bargaining agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.490" offset="1937324">I mean, if it's a non-unionized plan such as, I guess Allied Structural Steel was, the plaintiffs would not have any of this other four -- wouldn't have three out of these other four causes of action, would they, couldn't have had?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sherman_carmell" startTime="472.038" stopTime="797.394">
            <label>Mr. Sherman Carmell</label>
            <text syncTime="472.038" offset="1991555">They would not have had cause of action under Section 302.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.368" offset="2004825">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.586" offset="2009736">There was no cause of action under the WPPDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.023" offset="2023424">There was no private cause of action under the NLRA or the LMRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.595" offset="2041710">That is correct Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.162" offset="2047979">But as I would hope to explain, that was Congress' deliberate choice and is most fully canvassed in this Court's decision in Malone as to the specific choices that Congress made but I would like to address once more your specific point.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.815" offset="2106598">I am not saying that the NLRA covered only collectively bargained plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.315" offset="2132616">I am saying that Congress considered retirement plans and the Inland Steel Plan had been in existence for a long period of time before that as being a subject for collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.653" offset="2177964">So whereas the Court of Appeals said that the reason why Congress and the Securities Acts did not consider pension plans or I mention them was that they were rather innocuous in number, the same Congress relatively was considering them to be sufficient importance to be considered within mandatory subjects of bargaining as opposed to permissive subjects of bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.820" offset="2278693">1947 as Your Honor's already pointed out, saw Congress enact Section 302 (c) (5) and I think the significance of Section 302 Your Honors is that Congress made a deliberate choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.013" offset="2339401">It shows only to regulate collectively bargained pension plan as Mr. Justice Stewart stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.866" offset="2362807">Although it had before it considerations of other issues and it shows then to only regulate the structure of the plan and certain of the extent of the purposes which the funds could be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.550" offset="2425605">A very, very limited regulation by Congress but a very deliberate regulation as this Court discussed in Arroyo versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.296" offset="2460505">But, the Welfare and Pension Plan Disclosure Act, the proceedings from 1954 on which were fully canvassed in this Court's decision in Malone are really the most significant, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.964" offset="2511182">Because Malone stated that Congress entered “a nearly unregulated pension field.”</text>
            <text syncTime="609.703" offset="2542216">And Congress heard from numerous witnesses beginning in 1955 including the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commissioner Godwin agreed with Senator Allott in 1955 that “The Securities and Exchange Commission would comment to this particular field only by accident, so to speak, by virtue of the fact that for example in some of these plans stock is offered.”</text>
            <text syncTime="637.120" offset="2651826">After Congress heard all of the witnesses including the Commission, it issued a Senate Report which is quoted and I won't go through it all the pages 29 and 30 of our brief stating they just didn't think there was any federal regulation of these plans but shows not to regulate its substantively but as this Court noted just to allow filings.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.055" offset="2747643">By 1972 Your Honors, we all know, as this discussion in Manhart indicates, Congress had completely changed its mind and had completely made a complete turnaround as far as the priorities and that therefore under ERISA detailed the timing nature and disclosure that was to be made to plan participants and for the first time under Section 502 (a) granted a limited right of suit by a plan participant and granted a conjunctive right to sue with the Secretary of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.094" offset="2915767">1958, Welfare and Pension Plan Disclosures Acts failure to include a private right of action was not an accident Your Honor because as our brief has shown, it rejected proposals by Professor Metlzer and Cox that would have established the analogous right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.452" offset="3001135">ERISA's design was careful, complex, discrete and fraught with a great number of problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.507" offset="3041364">But in the end, the Court of Appeals was not satisfied with Congress's action in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.251" offset="3068426">It felt the plan participants deserve more.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.826" offset="3082637">It made value judgments, judgments which the Congress is entrusted to make and which the Congress specifically did not make.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.803" offset="3138539">With -- under those circumstances, these case I believe and the courts below stands for the proposition that a court can expand through the province of the Securities Acts to enact that type of legislation which for almost 37 years that Congress deliberately refused to enact to give protection to plan participants that Congress would not give and to posit causes of action with Cong -- which Congress disclaimed.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="797.394" offset="3292975">Well, it wouldn't -- you would -- wouldn't you agree that Judge Tone's concurring opinion is evidence of anything but a value of judgment that he instinctively -- his sense of values or his sense of -- his instinctive sense would have led him the other way but he thought he was driven to this conclusion by the language of the statute, isn't that about what he said?</text>

            <text syncTime="819.779" offset="3382523">I don't believe it was -- by the breadth of the statute and by the fact that this Court has not spoken particularly to the issue I believe was another factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.720" offset="3426304">I don't know why Judge Tone's opinion did not end with our dissent because I believe it was written up to that point so it sounded that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.069" offset="3463607">So, I cannot define that Your Honor but I don't believe that full consideration was given to the labor statutes, the line, the cohesive line from the labor statutes on one side and the absence of anything definitive on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.969" offset="3543228">As I said Your Honor the reverse -- please the Court, the reversal of this case does not end the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.543" offset="3565589">It will leave Mr. Daniel and his class of plaintiffs with four causes of action under the federal labor statutes and under state common law fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="904.188" offset="3720129">For the purposes of this case, Mr. Justice Stevens, we are accepting the fact that he had a break in service which was involuntary and by a layoff and will -- except for the premise that it was -- should have only run four months.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.735" offset="3778330">I don't believe that the question of the application of the break in service rule is relevant to the Securities Acts counts because if it's an arbitrary structural violation, under Section 302 (c) (5) there is a remedy or at least there appear -- the District Court has said that there is a remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="948.308" offset="3896613">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.931" offset="3915107">As Mr. Carmell has indicated, there is no dispute that in the extensive legislative history that preceded the enactment of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934 and in the statutes themselves as initially enacted, there was no mention whatever of pension plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.522" offset="4005491">Certainly the reason for not mentioning pension plans could not have been as the court below suggested that there was such a rare bird that Congress simply ignored them or overlooked them.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.600" offset="4057736">At the time of the enactment of the Securities Laws, 3.5 to 4 million United American employees employed by hundreds of large industrial corporations were covered by pension plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.497" offset="4121370">Moreover, that Congress was legislating with respect to pensions in the Revenue Acts of 1926, 28, 32 and 34 in the Railroad Retirement Act of 1934 and as Mr. Carmell has indicated they played a role in the legislative history of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.723" offset="4214262">It is not our point that this was a subject for special legislative concern on the collective bargaining area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.357" offset="4248848">It is rather our point that whenever Congress turn to the subject of pensions, it was functioning in the employer-employee area of which collective bargaining, it's, of course, just one aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.091" offset="4315721">We believe the reason why one finds no mention whatever of pensions in the Securities Laws is that as this Court said in Forman, the Congress's focus in enacting those laws was to deal with the capital markets of the enterprise system and to regulate the sale of securities to raise capital for profit making purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.503" offset="4421360">When we speak of pensions on retirement from employment, we are not dealing with a capital market, we are dealing with the labor market nor are we talking about the raising of capital for profit making purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.559" offset="4489592">Certainly pensions are not included within the types of arrangements that again to quote according Forman in our commercial world fall within the ordinary concept to the security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.175" offset="4552077">This short straightforward analysis which occupied but eight pages of our opening brief is we believe the answer here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.919" offset="4599097">But transaction under which someone goes to work for an employer and as thereby covered by a noncontributory pension plan as an incident of his employment is like the transaction in Forman simply not a purchase of securities within the contemplation of the Federal Securities Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.320" offset="4696691">There is one type of pension plan which is unarguably covered by the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.972" offset="4735248">This is a type of voluntary contributory plan where employee contributions are used to purchase the employer stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.372" offset="4780910">Put it in another way, to add capital to the employer's coffers for profit making purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.586" offset="4805674">But this is not covered because it is a pension plan but rather because it is an employee stock purchase plan and the fact that it has pension or retirement features does not alter that basic fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.233" offset="4876309">The SEC has consistently treated such plans as subject to the Securities Acts, has advised Congress to that effect and no one seriously quarrels with that proposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="2282.915" offset="9234996">In considering whether this is a security, Mr. Daniel for more than 22 years worked for employers who in return for his labor made contributions to his union's pension fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.304" offset="9292570">I think a very vivid description of why this is a security is contained in the union's own literature that it distributed to its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.068" offset="9335620">If I may quote two sentences from Page 70 (a) 14 of the appendix in one of the brochures that the union distributed it contains this description of the pension fund and of the members' contribution -- of the contributions that are made on behalf of the members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.768" offset="9410435">It says, “The contributions, earned income by being invested consequently the money originally contributed grows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.271" offset="9452440">Without this income growth the fund could not accumulate enough money to pay the $250.00 monthly pensions provided by the plan.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.392" offset="9500923">That in a nutshell is what an investment contract is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.521" offset="9521507">Outside of the employment context, it is clear that a participation in a fund of this sort which invest its assets and returns more money at a later date as a security and through a series of six decisions of this Court beginning with the Joiner case in 1943 and continuing most recently through the Forman decision in 1975, this Court has construed the term investment contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.725" offset="9630281">And those decisions demonstrate that so long as there is present the type of relationship found in this case, a relationship in which the investor participates in a common venture with the expectation of profits to be derived from the managerial efforts of others, there is a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.227" offset="9708231">All the requisite features are present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.753" offset="9718366">The employee makes an investment by giving value in the form of his labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.510" offset="9737383">The purpose of the fund is to provide employees with more return than the amounts contributed profits.</text>

            <text syncTime="3236.265" offset="13048456">And the definitions that this Court has developed for -- ever since the Joiner case and has been developed by this Court and the lower courts for over 40 years clearly encompass this kind of an interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3273.413" offset="13197040">In the Forman case, it was used against the plaintiff but it really didn't change the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.754" offset="13214386">And in particular the reliance on Forman is really as a basis for claiming that somehow the United Benefit case is no longer the law wherein United Benefit, the court clearly held that the security element could be separated from the insurance element.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.825" offset="13282722">And they also in effect say that Forman has overruled the long line of cases as to whether an instrument in order to be a security has to be something that's traded in the markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.644" offset="13325981">That is definitely not the law and to say that a decision like Forman with the Court -- which the Court did not view as being any change has somehow eliminated all that to us it seems totally unreasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="4351.804" offset="17510588">He characterized the employees entering into employment at something about which the pension is incidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="4363.789" offset="17558549">In many cases the pension is the primary motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4367.982" offset="17575267">There are many examples of a person who will stay in a job that he doesn't like or not change jobs because he is expecting a pension in the present job.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.716" offset="17614242">He may even forgo a job with higher pay because when you count up the benefits of the pension, it amounts to more money.</text>
            <text syncTime="4385.139" offset="17643917">There are employees who will stay in a job when they're sick, when they're hurt because they want to hang on the last few years to get a pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="4392.172" offset="17672025">Certainly in those cases the pension is the primary consideration and even for the new employee seeking a career and deciding to make a choice between fields, you can easily discern the value of the pension to him in evaluating comparative salaries and he can easily compute that the value of the pension will have a certain dollar benefit which may be the decision-making factor in choosing between interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="4442.046" offset="17871600">And this economic interest is an interest in the pool or fund professionally managed investments, stocks, funds, mortgages and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="4450.193" offset="17904097">It is in this nature akin to a mutual fund or a variable annuity and I might add an answer to some of the comments made by the petitioner, counsel for petitioners this morning that a variable annuity fund is also a fund, an interest in the variable annuity is a security and is a type of security which provides for the annuitant the payment in the future of an annuity as you will, a retirement benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4477.681" offset="18014124">The economic interest here as in 7441 or United Benefit Life was acquired in a periodic investment program by the giving of services involving the pooling and professional management of other people's money to provide for a benefit, profits if you will at retirement in the form of an annuity.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sidney Dickstein</label>
            <text syncTime="5068.135" offset="20375907">Mr. Barack, at the end of his argument said that we have conceded that an interest in a voluntary contributory pension fund is a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="5079.122" offset="20419897">I feel like the man who gave up the tip of his finger and found that his whole arm had been swallowed up.</text>
            <text syncTime="5084.491" offset="20441318">We've said it again and again and again, we said in our reply brief all that we do say and this is consistent with what the SEC has said, is that where you have a plan where employer stock is purchased with employee money, that is a security, but nothing else is.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.194" offset="20512162">And Mr. Stillman and I think with candor in honor to your question Mr. Justice Rehnquist as to whether or not the security, the inaction of the Securities and Exchange Commission can in anyway be attributed to their position with regard to no sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="5120.695" offset="20586141">Stated with candor that as a matter of fact, the SEC has taken no enforcement action whatever even with respect to voluntary contributory plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="5134.721" offset="20642252">And we believe that 35 years of quiescence from an agency which is hardly known for its passivity speaks volumes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5150.333" offset="20704737">There was another question asked of Mr. Barack and that was how much of this increase in pension benefits from $75.00 to $550.00 represent increase in employer contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5163.761" offset="20758444">Mr. Barack actually did have the figures and he stated it although in an inadvertent way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5169.994" offset="20783313">The initial employer contributions to the 705 fund were $2.00 a week as Mr. Barack says it's now $30.00 a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="5179.410" offset="20821034">During the period of time in which the pension benefit, the defined benefit has gone from $75.00 to $550.00, an increase of about seven-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="5191.199" offset="20868159">The amount of contribution has gone up 15 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="5197.345" offset="20892714">I think this is really relevant because it does tend to deal with even the isolated factors in this type of arrangement which Mr. Barack shows that under the Howey definition of a security demonstrate that this is a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="5217.877" offset="20974843">About Howey, I think the first thing to say is that the formulation in that case was designed to ascertain Congress' intent with respect to the use of the word security.</text>
            <text syncTime="5231.388" offset="21028968">Here we think there are much better indicia of congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5236.232" offset="21048299">But even if there were not and even if one looks at the Howey formulation, we think it's simply intends to reinforce the proposition that when you're talking about pensions, you are outside of the realm of the Securities Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="5255.805" offset="21126562">They say investment of money, the first Howey criteria or element and I say, well, we have it here because when the employer puts $2.00 in the pension fund that's the same as if he handed the $2.00 to the employee and the employee hand it to the pension fund administrator and said put this away for my retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5276.456" offset="21209213">Well, this Court of course in Alabama Power when it considered the questions of pensions recognized that it is by no means as simple as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5285.835" offset="21246725">There are all kinds of reasons why employers have pension plans and why employers make contributions to pension plans including the humanitarian as well as a good labor policy reason that when an employee is too old to work he would have some money in his pocket as he leaves the plant door.</text>
            <text syncTime="5307.760" offset="21334392">A dollar in the pension fund in a noncontributory pension plan is not fungible with a dollar purchase of a mutual fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="5317.800" offset="21374621">And as a matter of fact ERISA make sharp distinctions between contributory, between employer dollars and employee dollars, when the employee makes a contribution to a pension plan it by terms of ERISA is non-forfeitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5335.246" offset="21444315">When the employer makes a contribution of course it is forfeitable unless and until vesting is achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5345.800" offset="21486529">They talked about the interest income.</text>
            <text syncTime="5349.989" offset="21503352">Whose income really is this?</text>
            <text syncTime="5352.494" offset="21513383">In the simple model of a single employer pension plan it's quite clear that the interest income which is earned on the money that that employer places on the fund has to do with the level of funding and how much more the employer has to put in, in order to pay the defined benefit provided by that plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5375.233" offset="21604289">I will not go into each of these factors in isolation but when one views them in Howey terms, one has to conclude that they're all somewhat skewed and I think I'm being charitable when I say somewhat.</text>
            <text syncTime="5392.206" offset="21672208">Because the point is these elements cannot be viewed in isolation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5397.125" offset="21691852">Along of the other factors pertaining to noncontributory pension plans, the plaintiff and the SEC dismisses their relevancies, break in service, minimum periods of employment, whoever heard of a security where you get paid off if you're disabled and you don't get paid off if you quit your job.</text>
            <text syncTime="5422.658" offset="21794043">We are talking about an aspect of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5427.140" offset="21811911">I quite agree with Mr. Stillman --</text>

            <text syncTime="5428.317" offset="21816613">Mr. Dickstein, (Voice Overlap) -- if you look at the -- this thing in a broad sense as you're suggesting now, you supposed that before vesting occurs an employee would have standing to bring a lawsuit to challenge the administration of the fund by the trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="5441.973" offset="21871261">Your figure suggests that contributions went out 15 fold when benefits only went up seven or eight fold.</text>

            <text syncTime="5497.761" offset="22094451">Well, a forfeitability doesn't mean it's not a security does it because then you can have an agreement of sale for cost of land and if you got a bunch of orange groves on it, it can -- could conceivably come within the Howey-Joiner rationale and still the contract might be forfeitable.</text>

            <text syncTime="5531.500" offset="22229347">But you put it all together and you examined the totality of the transaction, it's clear that's its not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5537.621" offset="22253902">Mr. Stillman spoke about the six cases that this -- in which this Court has dealt with the question of security and from Joiner in '43, the Forman in '75, it all comes down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5551.609" offset="22309804">The test is what character the instrument is giving in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5557.245" offset="22332374">It was setting Joiner that way, we're setting Forman that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5560.815" offset="22346585">We think the common understanding here, the common understanding in 33, 34 and today is that it is not a security.</text>
