            <text syncTime="57.695" offset="334137">This case arises as a result of a special mayoral election held in the City of Chicago on June 7th, 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.161" offset="367992">The plaintiffs -- appellees alleged that Sections 10-2 and 10-3 of Chapter 46, Illinois Revised Statutes unconstitutionally deprived them of their equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.282" offset="424521">In this case, they were required under the 5% minimum signature requirement to obtain approximately 36,000 signatures while statewide candidates independent new political party candidates running for state office need only 25,000 signatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.852" offset="490768">The trial court below issued a permanent injunction against requiring more than 25,000 signatures for all future elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.858" offset="526817">The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.921" offset="547088">Notwithstanding the objection of the appellant during the course of the proceedings, the U.S. Labor Party entered into a private agreement with the Chicago Board of Elections Commissioners to further lower the signature requirements from 25,000 to 20,000 and to extend the filing period from 64 days before the election to 50 days before the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.294" offset="632560">The Court of Appeals declined to resolve this letter issue on the grounds of mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.976" offset="659310">Appellant submits that it is crucial that this case presents a serious threat to the viability of three established doctrines of this Court, stare decisis, summary affirmance and mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.231" offset="712286">With respect to summary -- I am sorry, with respect to stare decisis, appellant submits that the issues involved in this appeal, namely the discrepancy between 25,000 signatures required for independents and new political party candidates running statewide and the 5% signature requirement for all other offices in the state was presented in the jurisdictional statement in Jackson v. Ogilvie, it was presented to this Court and we have at issue the same statute which was challenged in Jackson v. Ogilvie.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.997" offset="823359">It was presented to this Court and we have at issue the same statute which was challenged in Jackson v. Ogilvie.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.785" offset="854497">We have the same defendant which was sued in Jackson v. Ogilvie.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.773" offset="870484">We have the same office being sought which is Mayor and in the essence, we argue that the same statute is again being relitigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.543" offset="901517">We argue in our briefs that the principle stare decisis and the interest of uniformity and predictability should have guided the lower courts into affirming the constitutionality of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.109" offset="943835">We also suggest that the law of the case although not on all fours necessarily with this case should be expanded to include a situation where an identical statute is being challenged and in effect we maintain the same script as being presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.713" offset="1010186">The actors are different but the roles are the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="300.979" offset="1307251">But as Justice White stated in Hicks versus Miranda, “votes to affirm summarily and to dismiss for one of a substantial federal question, it hardly needs comments or votes on the merits of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2046.472" offset="8289259">In other words, no candidate according to the record in this case, no candidate whether a third party or an independent has ever qualified for office in Cook County by meeting the 5% requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.536" offset="8337533">Furthermore, only one candidate in the history of the law since 1931 prior to the decision below, only one candidate has ever qualified for office in Chicago by meeting this requirement.</text>
