            <text syncTime="85.715" offset="446255">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, The respondent in this matter was entited by a New Jersey state grand jury in two counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.183" offset="484080">First count; for misuse of his public offices for the benefit of a private developer.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.372" offset="508844">The second count; for obtaining approximately $31,000 from that developer through Conduit Corp to which he was not entitled as a public official.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.879" offset="574882">After a jury trial, the respondent was convicted on count two and acquitted on count one.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.772" offset="602467">Matter was appealed to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey, which reversed the conviction on one ground, and that was that in the course of the trial, the trial court had ruled in such a way as to deprive the respondent of his Fifth Amendment privilege thereby causing him not to testify, thereby depriving the perjury of evidence that would – it would otherwise have received.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.648" offset="733915">State appealed to the New Jersey Supreme Court which denied the state’s appeal and denied a petition for certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.566" offset="773622">The two issues which had been raised before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.315" offset="792639">One is whether the Fifth Amendment privilege was properly asserted by the respondent in the trial and the second was whether the Harris case, rationale of the Harris case was properly applied to the facts of this case by the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.803" offset="874559">The issues in this case arise out of a series of in-camera discussions, which took place among counsel on the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.721" offset="922206">During the course of those in-camera discussions, a number of the issues were discussed, including the scope of cross-examination of the respondent in the event that the respondent would testify and whether the state would be permitted to use any of the respondent’s pretrial statements, which were obtained under various circumstances over an extended period of time for the purpose of cross-examination of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.863" offset="1058774">At the conclusion of the in-camera discussions, respondent’s attorney announced that in reliance on what he believed to be the court’s ruling, his client was not going to testify.</text>

            <text syncTime="281.476" offset="1229302">During the course of the in-camera proceedings, the trial court on at least 14 separate occasions that I have counted in going through the record, said that he would not rule generally on whether the state could use or under what circumstances the state could use prior statements for the purpose of cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.543" offset="1317595">The court indicated that he was bound by New Jersey Law which requires the rule on a question by question basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.658" offset="1349987">And because of the fact that no specific ruling was permitted on a proffer of proof by the state for cross-examination purposes, we do not know specifically what circumstances would have been raised in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.749" offset="1802324">Our position is that as a matter of federal law, in order to receive the benefit of the Fifth Amendment protection, the respondent is required to assert the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.161" offset="1844015">Our position is that in this case, he did not assert the Fifth Amendment, because he did not take the stand under the procedure that it had been established by the trail court for his protection, permit the issue to be framed in such a way that it could be resolved on a constitutional basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="474.640" offset="2001899">I think it would be a more difficult federal question because of the fact that the state court’s ruling would have been based on state court procedure, but on the other hand in this case, there was no discussion of state court procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.980" offset="2063339">This case was decided by the Appellate Division squarely on constitutional grounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="497.690" offset="2094164">Now you say, just be sure I have it clear, that in the bench conference when this subject was discussed, the judge made it clear that he would not make anticipatory rulings but would require them to submit the question at a bench conference, when and if he took the stand.</text>

            <text syncTime="523.832" offset="2198653">As a matter of fact, the trial court when the respondent’s attorney announced that his client was not going to take the stand expressed surprise at that conclusion, and indicated that the respondent had made a tactical judgment, not in reliance on his rulings with respect to the use of prior statements, but a tactical judgment not to testify and was simply using this as an excuse to surround his tactical judgment with some constitutional implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.267" offset="2324459">In the course of the in-camera discussions, the issue that was faced and resolved squarely by the court was the scope of permissible cross-examination of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.825" offset="2374719">That is the defendant argued that the scope of cross-examination should be narrowed to the scope of direct examination intended to use only a very narrow area on cross-examination and asked the court to restrict the prosecution in his cross-examination only to those factual issues raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.050" offset="2463535">The prosecution objected very strongly to that and took the position that the scope of cross-examination should be as broad as all of the evidence which it had put it in its case in chief, none of which by the way have been alleged by the respondent to have resulted from tainted statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.978" offset="2543261">There is no element in this case concerning the way in which the prosecution had acquired all of the evidence which it had put it in its case in chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.112" offset="2587773">The trial court ruled then that the prosecution would be permitted to broaden its cross-examination to the scope of its evidence which it had been put it in its case in chief, its testimonial and documentary evidence and that in the event that further cross-examination were requested by the state in which any of the respondent’s prior statements would be used, the government -- the prosecution then would have to approach the bench and raise the question at that time with the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.647" offset="2721938">It was after the ruling on the scope of cross-examination that the respondent indicated that he was not going to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.035" offset="2759555">And at that point, the court expressed surprises I indicated before and indicated that in effect the respondent had made a tactical judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="696.124" offset="2887868">What is the rule in New Jersey?</text>

            <text syncTime="701.625" offset="2909915">The trial court’s decision on the scope of cross-examination was based on New Jersey case law, which makes it clear that when a defendant takes the stand, he takes the stand as any other witness and subjects.</text>

            <text syncTime="1093.327" offset="4476635">Respondent provided information on basically three occasions, twice in the state grand jury and once in a statement under oath outside of the grand jury several months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.792" offset="4546539">During the first appearance in the grand jury, the purpose for his testimony was simply to identify certain records which we are not covered by the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.388" offset="4584887">There had been a hearing by the trial court prior to his first appearance and he was ordered to produce certain records before the grand jury and to simply identify what those record were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.412" offset="4640998">He appeared shortly after that time in the state grand jury, under the protection of the state’s public official immunity law, which is a self-executing was at that time, a self-executing use plus derivative use immunity statue which covered public officials’ testifying about conduct in their public offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.514" offset="4741413">Several months later, as the result of a series of discussions between counsel representing the respondent at that time and the prosecution, a statement was taken from the respondent under oath outside of the grand jury for the purpose of defining the testimony that was required for a case in which it was contemplated that the respondent would ultimately be a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.964" offset="4851231">It was a related case, it was an indictment that was about to be returned concerning the individuals who operated the development company and the Conduit Corporation through which the respondent had received the approximately $ 31,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.855" offset="4918836">Ultimately that indictment was returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.763" offset="4938376">It is interesting and I think instructive to look at the change of position, which the respondent has taken between the beginning of the trial and this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.903" offset="4990934">His original argument prior to going the trial was that the indictment should be dismissed because he in effect had made a deal with the state in return for his cooperation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.680" offset="5042134">He believed that the state had entered into a contract which should have barred the state from retuning an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.566" offset="5073586">Although it is clear from the record that his cooperation, his testimony in the grand jury was the result of a desire to strike a bargain with the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.672" offset="5114023">The trial court at that time found that no such contract had been entered into and held that the indictment should not be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.413" offset="5149027">But it is clear that in his case, we are not dealing with a defendant who has been brought into a grand jury asserting his Fifth Amendment privilege and refusing to testify, there is more of a willingness demonstrated on the part of this respondent to supply information, although he asked for and received immunity protection, but a willingness to disclose that information because that disclosure was to be in his best interests in disposing ultimately of the criminal charges that faced --</text>

            <text syncTime="1344.487" offset="5481305">There had been only very few cases decided on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.395" offset="5496978">Hockenberry has been relied on in each of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.161" offset="5512025">Hockenberry, the state contends, is wrong in one respect and certainly distinguishable in another significant respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.569" offset="5553612">I realize that the Hockenberry case has only limited presidential value here, but I think that the distinction between the facts of the Hockenberry case and this case are extremely important, and I want to take one moment to address that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.848" offset="5618813">In the Hockenberry case, the defendant had been subpoenant to a grand jury and had testified truthfully about having perjured himself previously and testified forcedly in another respect unrelated to the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.541" offset="5689553">He was entited for the perjury at his trial when he testified, the prosecution used his truthful testimony indicating that he had previously committed perjury for the purpose of impeaching his credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.066" offset="5763636">Clearly the purpose was not to demonstrate a conflict between his trial testimony and his grand jury testimony, the purpose was to permit the jury to infer from the truth of what he had said in the grand jury, having admitted committing perjury previously, to infer from the truth of what he said that he was an habitual liar, that is not the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.121" offset="5855901">No matter how you construe the decision made by the trial court in this case, it was clearly not so broad as to permit the jury to infer from the truth of what would have been offered from his prior statements, any facts, but simply to demonstrate that there was an inconsistency between what he had said previously under oath and what he was saying now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.698" offset="5954121">Most importantly though, I think that the Hockenberry case and the Appellate Division of this case misconstrued the import of the Harris case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.486" offset="5997275">It had to distinguish Harris versus New York in order to get around the implications of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.924" offset="6035101">The Harris case of course dealt with a Miranda situation; a statement obtained in violation of the Miranda rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.991" offset="6067388">In the Appellate Division and in Hockenberry, the court described a Miranda confession as a voluntary confession and said that since this was an immunity situation, the statement was taken involuntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.834" offset="6122663">I dispute that characterization of Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.027" offset="6135515">The Miranda case clearly deals with statements which are compelled that you are involuntarily obtained.</text>

            <text syncTime="2115.532" offset="8565530">The facts of this case are that the respondent did go before the grand jury after advising the prosecutor that he wished to have his Fifth Amendment rights protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.004" offset="8619342">It was only at that time after insisting on his Fifth Amendment protection and privilege that he was offered the grant of immunity under the New Jersey Public Employees Immunity Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.527" offset="8661452">So the willingness was compelled, it was not him coming forward in volunteering and saying, oh, by the way do I also have immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.520" offset="8697501">He refused to testify, sought and obtained immunity from the court and the language of the immunity grand is explicit as said out in our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2172.798" offset="8794572">He gave grand jury testimony and he also gave other statements to the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.266" offset="8816410">I submit that all of that testimony that he gave and all of those statements are obtained by the state as a direct result of his immunized grand jury testimony and therefore under Kastigar, clearly are precluded from use as are the grand jury statements.</text>
