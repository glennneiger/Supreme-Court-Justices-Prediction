            <text syncTime="56.688" offset="330167">The case at Bar results from an automobile accident, which occurred in the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.303" offset="356603">The driver of the automobile was an employee of the State of Nevada, whose presence in California resulted from his employment with the University of Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.144" offset="403937">Neither his status as an employee of the State of Nevada nor his status as being in the course of his employment were contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.916" offset="446986">There had never been an issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.283" offset="464541">When the accident was initially filed, the State of Nevada moved to quash service of process on the basis of immunity from suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.395" offset="496933">The trail court granted that motion; it was upheld by the California Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.348" offset="524727">The California Supreme Court in 1973 decision reported as Hall versus University of Nevada reversed the California Court of Appeals, remanded the matter to the trail court holding that sister States who engage in activities in the State of California have no immunity from suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.610" offset="609782">The State of Nevada requested certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.648" offset="622007">That request was denied and the matter was returned to the Superior Court for Alameda County, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.498" offset="649383">At the beginning of the trail, the State of Nevada requested an order limiting any damages which resulted to the statutory limitation contained in Nevada’s waiver sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.393" offset="708942">That limitation being $25,000 per individual or per claimant or in the context of this action $50,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.648" offset="750007">That motion was denied and the jury returned to verdict of $1,150,000 as against the State of Nevada as a named defendant in this negligence action.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.082" offset="799744">The State of Nevada appealed to the California Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.333" offset="820746">The California Court of Appeals sustained the trail court verdict and the jury verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.513" offset="845406">The California Supreme Court denied hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.222" offset="860244">Certiorari was requested and certiorari issued to the California Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.829" offset="882709">In a capsule, the position of the State of Nevada is that unconcerning states may not be sued in any court in this nation and that where consent is given, the terms, conditions and limitations contained in that consent must be adhered to and that any action tried must proceed according to the terms and limitations of the consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.356" offset="1008828">The holding of the California Court of Appeals is simply that sister States have no immunity from suit in the State of California.</text>

            <text syncTime="356.203" offset="1528142">That limitation is found in the Full Faith and Credit Clause and the decisions of this court, which have held that the Full Faith and Credit Clause apart from requiring Full Faith and Credit be given the judgments stood for the additional principle and I think perhaps more important principle of unifying the states of union.</text>

            <text syncTime="1317.910" offset="5375039">That's exactly right, the only reason that we have property in State of California, I think this is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.013" offset="5395414">Actually there are two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.984" offset="5399280">One is because, we are a small state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.374" offset="5404818">The State of Nevada has 600,000 people; most of our major businesses are headquartered in our neighboring State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.720" offset="5442226">Those businesses don't even maintain large bank accounts in Nevada and rather they desire to collect their sales tax as it comes in and when they have to pay it on a quarterly basis, they pay it on a bank draft out of State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.846" offset="5498755">So, because of the size of the State of Nevada, because of our dependence in the modern business world upon tax revenues coming in from accounts that our businesses wish to maintain in another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.943" offset="5559150">The other state has ability to execute against those accounts and we don't have the ability to rely upon our own courts to protect us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.620" offset="5593840">But I might point out to the court that if in fact the respondent's position is correct, it wouldn't make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.507" offset="5625396">Whether we had the right protect ourselves, because under the respondents' version of the case, we can be sued as any other person in the State of California and when we are sued, we are subject to unlimited liability and under their theory, we would be required to give Full Faith and Credit to the California judgment not withstanding the fact that it is unequivocally opposed to our state policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2643.004" offset="10675388">There is another question concerning the -- that the Court is raised -- I was going to start at my very beginning before I -- to try to talk about what is not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.001" offset="10723349">I don't feel that there is any real constitutional issue involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.216" offset="10760234">We don't have a legislative power of Congress to impose suability against states involved here, which has been a question before this Court and which has caused a great deal of law review articles and interests throughout the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.273" offset="10824495">And we don't have the question of the amenability of the Federal Government to suits by States that was raised as a specter by petitioner saying that California, if this case was upheld would then be suing the United States Government, because we do have a Supremacy cause of the United States constitution Article VI Section 1 and 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.902" offset="10930970">And I don't think that we are involved here and it's not involved in this case, the question of the judicial power of the Federal Courts vis-à-vis the Eleventh Amendment and the many cases that this Court has dealt with which surround that particular issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.555" offset="11005576">What we think is involved is basically a Full Faith and Credit question at most as raised by the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.845" offset="11050715">But I think under if you even assume that to be an issue, the place of the tort was State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.875" offset="11082898">The forum, the law of a forum was California, so we don't have the problem of selecting between the forum and the place of the tort, because they are one in the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.305" offset="11136606">We don't see any State of California, we feel as the constitutional power as I pointed out developed their own conflictive laws doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.312" offset="11180596">And that was cited in the Pearson case, which was relied on by counsel or petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.860" offset="11214764">I think what he did is he read the old opinion that was later then reversed and then judge Kauffmann wrote with the I think five other judges assenting with him, a new opinion, but I think petitioner misquoted the case saying that we could not base the obligation upon a foreign statute and then only take parts of it, because that was precisely the hearing and the holding on Pearson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.337" offset="11336704">They said the state under its constitutional power of choice of law had the right to reject the Massachusetts limitation of damages which was $15,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.913" offset="11395009">So, we think that refusal to apply the limitation on recovery is an exercise of that constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.764" offset="11430431">And as I have discussed before, I don't think there is any compelling state interest demonstrated by Nevada to require California to apply its laws, because one of the Turner versus Staggs case which certainly puts a serious question on the policy of the State of Nevada with regard to treatment of governmental tortfeasors and victims of governmental torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.805" offset="11546624">And also the Nevada constitutional Article IV Section 22 does waive the immunity; it authorizes the legislature to enact laws to allow them to be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.860" offset="11610781">So, I don't think that he can really argue the fact that this problem of sovereign immunity, because of the waiver in the constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3443.482" offset="13877269">We have the practice of suing -- the state owned the automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.831" offset="13906735">The driver was an employee of the University of Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.217" offset="13920214">So, on the side of caution and through years of being exposed to having sued the wrong defendant, we sued all of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.997" offset="13967339">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3470.130" offset="13983848">Just a few comments Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.710" offset="13990222">First of all, our indemnification clause was added by the 1977 Legislature, prior to that the only amount of indemnification that would have been received would be been under a special act of the legislature and even under our present indemnification it is limited to our liability limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.418" offset="14061066">I think the reason that the State of Nevada was sued is obvious; it was because of the deep pocket theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.882" offset="14082905">With respect to Paulus, we did not cite Paulus because we do not view this case as a conflicts case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.711" offset="14106206">We feel it becomes a conflicts case only if you first determine that we can be sued without our consent, because if you determine that we have to have consented the suit, then it must go off on our limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.555" offset="14161586">If we can be sued without our consent, at that time it becomes a balancing of governmental interest, but I would point to the court that even in that situation, we have provided for California's interest to be protected by allowing recovery up to a specified limitation and I might also add that there was insurance on the automobile that was being driven in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.988" offset="14247372">I think the judgment has already been satisfied to the extent of $110,000 or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.837" offset="14270673">Turner v. Staggs which was cited by respondent's stands for the proposition or overrule of the requirement in Nevada that one had to first file a claim with a Nevada Secretary of State within six months of the action in order to maintain a preceding against the State of Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.336" offset="14356668">It overruled NRS:41-039 which is one of 9 specific statutory sections dealing with our statutory limitations, it simply stands for the proposition that you cannot have a situation where private tortfeasors can sue without filing a claim and public tortfeasors are people who are torted by the public, by the government must first file a claim within six months after the accident happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.224" offset="14456247">Who knows what the answer would have been if the statute of limitations had been in the time for filing the claim, but Turner v. Staggs did not reach a question about limitation on liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.375" offset="14488848">And does not stand for the public policy that all tort victims should be treated the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.747" offset="14510373">As a matter of fact that has been reiterated in the state case of Calio versus State, which I do not have a citation for and I apologize, but Calio versus State is a 1977 case that came down prior to this decision and I thank the Court for your time.</text>
