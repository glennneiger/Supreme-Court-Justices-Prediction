            <text syncTime="20.661" offset="185971">This action was heard by a three-judge District Court which was empanelled to hear a challenge to the constitutionality of an Alabama statute which empowers and directs each city in town in Alabama to exercise its police power within a one-and-a half or three-mile zone around the city or the town.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.244" offset="272384">The adverse decision of the District Court against the plaintiffs was appealed to this Court under 28 USC Section 1253.</text>

            <text syncTime="187.451" offset="853138">Can't that just as readily be read to read "choosing to enforce regulations" as "being compelled to enforce regulations"?</text>

            <text syncTime="196.821" offset="890650">I believe that that statute has been interpreted in Alabama as defining a class of statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.646" offset="917922">Police ordinances and sanitary ordinances are two classes of ordinances.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.315" offset="936626">Other types might be financial regulations of the city, internal regulations of the city, for one reason or other, or zoning regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.363" offset="968808">Under Alabama law, zoning regulations are not police ordinances and so, in that way, this is a way of differentiating police and sanitation regulation, sanitary regulations from, say, zoning regulations or other types of ordinances that would not have an extraterritorial effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.721" offset="1122304">I believe that we cite both the City of Montgomery versus Roberson case and White versus City of Decatur.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.098" offset="1155741">City of Montgomery versus Roberson was a case that dealt with the power of the City of Montgomery to zone in its extraterritorial jurisdiction and the Alabama Supreme Court went into statutory construction in great lengths there to explain that these were just ways of describing certain classifications of ordinances and that zoning was not a police power within the normal meaning of the term as far as cities go because we had to pass a special law allowing cities to zone in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.290" offset="1288547">It was not considered to be in the normal grant of powers to cities by the State of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.650" offset="1321984">The case alleged both due process and equal protection grounds in the original complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.572" offset="1357615">We have briefed the question of due process and you will notice that we have cited only two cases, and that is United States versus Texas and United States versus Alabama, Judge Johnson's concurring opinion there.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.383" offset="1412890">The question of due process is so fundamental that it generally has not had to be raised in voting rights cases and, yet, if we think about it, the process that is due to all of these citizens is that if they are governed, they should be allowed to have some voice in the government over them.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.399" offset="1488959">The question is usually not presented to this Court in a due process context, but I believe that it should be in this case because even ignoring a comparison between the -- what the City of Tuscaloosa does to its citizens and what the City of Tuscaloosa does to the people in the police jurisdiction, the fundamental question under due process would be what should it do to the people in the police jurisdiction if it does not allow them to vote.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.681" offset="1702118">No, Your Honor, I do not believe that it would because, in that case, the city -- the state would have essentially abolished local government except through commissioners of some sort, agents that it appointed from the central government.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.646" offset="1753945">It has done that in the past with the Port of Mobile in the late 1800s.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.712" offset="1774216">I think that would be a fundamentally different situation here than one in which there is a local government which is elected and in which these people are not allowed to participate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1677.648" offset="6813968">Mr. Chief Justice and if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.474" offset="6829223">I first would like to more fully answer some of the questions that had been proposed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.007" offset="6863391">For instance, the -- Mr. Justice Powell asked the question "suppose this will confine two police powers in the extraterritorial aspect."</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.157" offset="6904038">Well, I say that it is so confined because, well, it's police insani -- ordinances of a police insanitary nature, maybe effective both within the city and within the police jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.145" offset="6955969">I know, really, other than the fact that the Court, the Municipal Court which is the same as the District Court in all respects, has jurisdiction out in this area, and that may be an aspect of police power but it -- other than that, I know of no other powers that are granted in the police jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.615" offset="7049801">As the Court, some of the members, have pointed out, there's no authority to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.909" offset="7062967">There's no authority to charge a business license outside or privilege license for the purpose of general revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.699" offset="7090134">Now, that's been clearly held by the Alabama Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.322" offset="7104658">Of course, within the city, you can't license for general revenue purposes and the business, the establishment, cannot contest on the ground that it's more than the cost of services might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.155" offset="7151992">But, outside the corporate limits, the Alabama Supreme Court has very carefully limited that to a charge commensurate with the cost of the services rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.658" offset="7193997">That's been going on since 1881 in the City of Van Holt versus Selma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.520" offset="7217403">The Supreme -- they were then making charges outside of the corporate limits and, there, the struck down an ordinance that made a charge more than the reasonable cause of promoting the health welfare and wellbeing of those persons in the police jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.209" offset="7280201">Later, when the so-called authorization to tax, it's been cited here many times, was adoptive of the state legislature in 1927, that's when it was adopted in another case which I don't have before me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.520" offset="7345403">It's in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.898" offset="7350941">Squarely ruled on it and the Court held that this added nothing to the authority of a municipality to license within the police jurisdiction.</text>
