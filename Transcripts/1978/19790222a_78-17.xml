            <label>Mr. Richard A. Allen</label>
            <text syncTime="43.842" offset="278758">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.866" offset="290879">The issue in this case is whether the Court of Appeals was correct in the holding that respondents and their predecessors in interest had lawfully abandoned the service of delivering natural gas in interstate commerce even though the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had never authorized the abandonment under Section 7(b) Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.301" offset="388577">Section 7(b) of the Act provides that natural gas company may abandon the service within the Commission’s jurisdiction “without permission and approval of the Commission first had and obtained after due hearing and a finding by the Commission that the available supply of natural gas is depleted to the extent the continuation of service is unwarranted or that the present or future public convenience or necessity permits abandonment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="100.491" offset="505292">To summarize the pertinent facts; in 1948 W. R. Quin acquired an oil and gas lease of attractive land in Texas known as the Butler B Tract.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.864" offset="554820">In 1953, his widow and successor in interest B. Quin entered into a gas sales contract with the United Gas Pipe Line company under which Mrs. Quin undertook to sell to United all merchantable natural gas produced from “all wells now or hereafter drilled during the term of the contract on a number tracks including Butler B.”</text>
            <text syncTime="139.898" offset="662967">In 1954, Mrs. Quin applied for and received from the Commission, a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the sales of gas as provided for in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.047" offset="711555">Subsequently, the lease was assigned several times.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.944" offset="731199">In one subsequent assignment amended the certificate -- amended the contract with the United to extent its term to 1981 and obtained a certificate from the Commission that authorized the service as proposed in the amended certificate -- in the amended contract and replacing the certificate that was originally issued to Mrs. Quin.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.888" offset="830882">Before 1966, one well on Butler B produced natural gas that was delivered to United under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.335" offset="864737">In 1966, the then assignee of the lease informed United that there was -- that the well was not producing any more gas and that no further gas would be available at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.443" offset="921161">No gas was produced from property for five years and during that time no one applied to the Commission for authority to abandon service under Section 7(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="215.663" offset="965987">In 1971, the assignee Haring assigned part of his interest in the Butler B Tract to the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.146" offset="1003917">They drilled a deeper well on Butler B, discovered more gas and entered into a contract to sell that gas to a DuPont plant in Texas that is in intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.802" offset="1050624">In 1973, United asserted a right to that gas under its 1953 contract as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.763" offset="1090435">And United -- respondents denied that the United had any right to the gas and United filed a complaint with the Commission, which commenced these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.875" offset="1130872">In the proceeding before Commission, respondent’s principle claim was that the original, the contracts with the United and the certificates from the Commission dedicated only the gas that was produced from the first well that was drilled on the property that is the well that was drilled before 1966, but not gas produced from the well that they had subsequently drilled.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.192" offset="1220106">Respondents also suggested to the Commission that even if the gas they were currently producing was dedicated to interstate commerce, the Commission should grant them abandonment authority nunc pro tunc or retroactively in 1966 when production from the first well had ceased.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.323" offset="1296697">The Commission held that the certificates issued to respondent’s predecessors dedicated all the gas produced from the Butler B Tract and thus imposed upon respondents an obligation under the Natural Gas Act to continue supplying that gas in the interstate commerce to United.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.746" offset="1374333">In view of the fact that the supply of gas under Butler B was concededly not depleted, the Commission also denied respondent's suggestion that the grant abandonment nunc pro tunc to 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.597" offset="1429713">The Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.748" offset="1438386">The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the facts of this case, established abandonment as a matter of law even though the Commission had never granted abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.326" offset="1484675">Particularly the Court of Appeals relied on the fact that production had ceased from during the period 1966 to 1971 that the parties during that period seem to believe that there was no more gas on the property and that the Commission probably would have granted an abandonment application if one had been filed in that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.203" offset="1580178">Those facts the court concluded made it necessary for respondents to comply with the requirements to Section 7(b) which forbids abandonment without obtaining approval from the Commission and until the Commission finds appropriate facts in an appropriate hearing and proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.969" offset="1663248">In the court’s view, the facts believed to be true in 1966 --</text>

            <text syncTime="394.426" offset="1681115">Mr. Allen, you mentioned a hearing and proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.371" offset="1688848">Is there a routinely a hearing into the abandonment applications filed?</text>

          <turn speaker="richard_a_allen" startTime="399.958" stopTime="426.032">
            <label>Mr. Richard A. Allen</label>
            <text syncTime="399.958" offset="1703163">There is not routinely a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.271" offset="1708492">The statute Mr. Stevens -- Justice Stevens provides for a due hearing, where there is an abandonment application and all of the interested parities were notified and the application itself demonstrates depletion of supply and the interested parties are concurring that there’s usually not a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.418" offset="1796995">But where there is some dispute there will be hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="426.032" offset="1807548">I got the impression from the briefs that normally there’s not a hearing.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="430.557" offset="1825625">Yeah.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Allen</label>
            <text syncTime="433.744" offset="1838373">But in any of that Commission -- in the Court of Appeals view, the facts that were believed to be true in 1966 made the Commission's participation in the abandonment process unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.265" offset="1888423">Our position is the Court of Appeals holding is contrary to the plain terms of Section 7(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="452.595" offset="1913710">In this case, the Commission never approved abandonment and never made any of the fact findings that abandonment would be warranted and indeed no one ever sought the Commission’s approval for abandonment at the time that those findings might have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.036" offset="1987480">The court’s holdings thus violates the plain language of Section 7(b) and it also violates the general principle of administrative law that a court is not empowered to make findings of fact or engage in functions that a statute entrusts exclusively to an administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.814" offset="2058637">The court’s holding that the facts of this case established abandonment also violates the specific objectives of Section 7(b) in at least three respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.126" offset="2095835">First, Section 7(b) serves to ensure that the Commission and all other interested parties will have an opportunity at relevant time to examine the facts bearing on abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.509" offset="2145364">The court’s holding would deprive them of that opportunity because the court found abandonment on the basis of facts that appeared to be true in 1966, but they were never examined by the Commission, by United or any other interested party in the kind of proceeding that Section 7(b) requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.700" offset="2222164">Second; Congress in Section 7(b) entrusted the Commission as the expert agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.452" offset="2245151">The task of making the determinations of facts pertaining to abandonment such as the alleged depletion of gas supplies.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.125" offset="2275871">The court’s holding on the other hand would authorize courts to make and to examine those facts and to determine those facts wholly independently of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.479" offset="2313279">For example, if it would authorize courts in this kind of case to determine whether the geological evidence known or available in 19 -- or discoverable in 1966 supported respondent’s predecessor's assertion that the gas supply was depleted.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.603" offset="2389765">Third, Section 7(b) provides necessary certainty in the entire regulatory system, by providing that only the Commission can grant lawful abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.814" offset="2434591">Producers, pipelines, purchasers, another interested parties have someway of knowing whether gas from acreage that was once dedicated to interstate commerce, remains dedicated to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.717" offset="2486209">Under the Court of Appeals holding, such persons would have no way of knowing whether that gas remains dedicated to interstate commerce, because some court in the future might find that some previous state of facts established a lawful abandonment, notwithstanding the absence of any Commission action.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.406" offset="2564995">Now the holding of the Court of Appeals that the fact established lawful abandonment appears to have been based in part on its view that if an application had been filed with the Commission in 1966, the Commission probably would have granted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.020" offset="2627480">And the respondents emphasized that notion in their brief to this Court by arguing primarily that because the Commission would have granted an abandonment application in 1966, the Commission erred as a matter of law in failing to grant abandonment nunc pro tunc in 1975, nunc pro tunc to 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.860" offset="2718804">There are two answers to that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.897" offset="2730924">First; it has no basis in fact. No one knows what the Commission would have done if an abandonment application had been filed in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.992" offset="2767391">No application was filed and therefore no one had any occasion or reason to examine the facts --</text>

            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="671.797" offset="2790588">And the Commission is different.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Allen</label>
            <text syncTime="674.241" offset="2800306">And the Commission is different, that’s absolutely correct, but in any event no one had any opportunity to examine the facts in the kind of proceeding that Section 7(b) contemplates.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.066" offset="2851610">Moreover we know now that the supply gas was in fact not depleted and it seems very strange to assume that the Commission would have made a finding that we now know to be false.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="697.960" offset="2895182">Mr. Allen I think your position is, if I'm not mistaken that even if they did demonstrate to put the Commissioners on the stand, that yes we would have granted it, you'd still say they didn’t have statutory authority.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_a_allen" startTime="706.605" stopTime="765.523">
            <label>Mr. Richard A. Allen</label>
            <text syncTime="706.605" offset="2929768">Absolutely that would be our second and principle argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.218" offset="2944293">The notion that the Commission would have granted, respondent’s contention that the Commission would have granted abandonment in 1966 is totally irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.679" offset="2990059">In fact it reflects a rather startling proposition of law that few regulatory agencies could operate under.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.096" offset="3023705">In effect, it would mean that anytime a statute requires agency authorization for an action, such as a certificate to operate an airline or license to sell alcoholic beverages, a person who was charged with failing to obtain that authorization would have a defense, a legal defense that if he had applied to the agency at some previous and proper time, the agency probably would have given him the authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.963" offset="3147212">In essence that’s what respondents’ position boils down to.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="765.523" offset="3165497">Do you think that might put a premium on having some lawyers go around pursing Mr. Justice Marshall’s suggestion and get affidavits from the former members of the Commission as some lawyers do going around the jurors --</text>

            <text syncTime="783.818" offset="3238640">It would put a tremendous premium on such activity Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.481" offset="3261315">Now respondent is trying to buttress this argument by arguing that Haring’s failure to apply for an abandonment application was “good faith.”</text>
            <text syncTime="798.430" offset="3297050">It's hard to see on this record what they mean by good faith because the fact of the matter is that the Secretary of the Commission during this period of non-production, twice wrote letters to the respondent’s predecessors and once to Haring saying that if no further sales are contemplated from this property, it's going to be necessary for you to file an abandonment application and further more it's going to be necessary for you to submit a statement of United with respect to it’s position on abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.453" offset="3429230">Haring nevertheless conceded in his testimony in this proceeding that he nevertheless made the determination that it wasn’t necessary and he didn’t do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.742" offset="3474369">In conclusion, I’d like to stress what this Court has recognized in a number of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.723" offset="3498297">Namely that Section 7(b) is of key important to the Commissions’ regulatory responsibilities under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.337" offset="3528704">Although the Commission makes every effort to do so to monitor service obligations under the Act, there is no way that it can keep track of the performance of every gas sales contract that it certificates under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.508" offset="3609370">In some cases deliveries under such contracts may fluctuate from day-to-day or even from year-to-year and in some cases production may cease and resume several time for any number of reasons, but unless somebody complains to the Commission, the Commission has absolute enforcement and assurance that the service obligations will be complied with is extremely difficult, if not impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.987" offset="3739355">Section 7(b) is critical to the Commission’s enforcement powers because as this Court recognized in Sunray Mid-Continent Oil Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.857" offset="3774777">It ensures that the Commission keeps legal control over service obligations even though the physical facts may be beyond its physical control.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.000" offset="3819395">Thus for example if it discovers that a producer is selling gas in intrastate commerce for sometime that it was dedicated to intrastate commerce, it may -- and the producer claims that well at some prior period there had been cessation of production and I thought my obligation had lapsed, the Commission can say if you thought that the supply of gas was depleted at some prior time, you should have come to us then to prove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.524" offset="3945514">But since you didn’t your service obligation and your legal service obligation remains, that’s essential to the Commission’s responsibilities under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.615" offset="3977801">In larger measure we submit the Court of Appeals decision would undermine that regulatory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.142" offset="4011969">With respect to the other points made by respondents in their brief, I’d like to rely on our brief on our reply brief and reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Knox Bemis</label>
            <text syncTime="1066.454" offset="4369220">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.371" offset="4384893">Mr. Justice Stevens you were asking of practical consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.223" offset="4404224">The only one that I can cite for you is the producer has to continue to file reports on the particular acreage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.114" offset="4435780">That in fact is apparently how the Commission knew to send the letters to the producer involved here asking to file for abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.103" offset="4475800">I intend to speak primarily of the reasons why Pipe Line and it’s customers need the safeguards of the Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act, and why these safeguards would be undercut by the holding of the Tenth Circuit on the position of the McCombs group here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.538" offset="4541524">I also intend to speak of practical problems and uncertainties that would arise either from the holding of the Court below or the position of the McCombs group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.822" offset="4586663">One of the statutory purposes or Section 7(b) as indicated in the due hearing language in that Section, is that interested parties be afforded the opportunity to be heard when a producer or any other natural gas company files for abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.026" offset="4663463">Indeed it is the Commission’s policy and practice to issues notices of the filing of such applications; such notices giving any interested party the chance to come in and state any objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.716" offset="4726262">That opportunity is afforded whether or not a formal hearing is actually held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.293" offset="4748518">Now of course in this case there was no such hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.956" offset="4759176">There was no such notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.738" offset="4766281">Indeed there was no informal notice even.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.620" offset="4781850">The producer never asked United either to agree to abandonment of the certificate or to release the producer from his contract obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.438" offset="4833155">Now, yet as asserted by the McCombs group and apparently assumed by the Court below, that abandonment would have been routinely granted if it had been sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.808" offset="4882578">That however is by no means clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.750" offset="4894386">First of all, it is by no means clear in the circumstance that United having a contract that it regarded as still being in effect with the producer, would have agreed, would have consented or would have agreed not to object, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.713" offset="4958229">Second, we have few other question of whether the reserves were in fact depleted in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.311" offset="4984665">Now a lot of the routine abandonment cases I believe involve a situation where you have no indication whatsoever of continuing production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.567" offset="5029595">We know that on the Butler B lease in 1966 despite the cessation of the natural gas production there was production from an oil well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.444" offset="5069197">In other words you have continuing hydrocarbon productions all the way through the period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.615" offset="5089782">Furthermore the record does not show the extent if any to quite show there were deeper test in areas adjoining or close by the Butler B lease when the producers asserts abandonment that would have been routine like granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.026" offset="5159476">So I think it is --</text>

            <label>Mr. Knox Bemis</label>
            <text syncTime="1308.245" offset="5336377">That is correct too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.524" offset="5349439">And indeed this is not an uncommon situation there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.318" offset="5372635">The fact that production seized at one time in the past is by no means and itself indicative of there being no future gas production or the supplies being exhausted within the meaning of Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.865" offset="5446823">So we really do not know what would have happened even though as the McCombs group points out there were a number of routine abandonment applications granted during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.576" offset="5505651">That incidentally is not so more recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.576" offset="5517667">In fact there is a recent decision of the Commission proceeding involving a Texaco where the Commission declined to grant abandonment on essentially the same facts as what have appeared here in the period 1966 through 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.145" offset="5615992">The right of the interstate pipeline and its customers have been cut-off by the decision of the Tenth Circuit and would be cut-off by the position adopted by the McCombs group here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.054" offset="5679626">In its brief the McCombs group argues that the hearing in this proceeding is not a good substitute for the hearing that should have been held on the abandonment application they should have filed in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.339" offset="5744724">That clearly cannot be maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.521" offset="5757471">The hearing in this case involved the question of retroactive abandonment of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.276" offset="5788505">It also has as its basis, as its starting point, the knowledge that the central fact that the producer would have been trying to establish then i.e. depletion of reserves is false.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.878" offset="5850885">In other words, it is very difficult to have a due hearing about whether the reserves have been depleted when you know that they have not been depleted and you are trying to speculate as to what the parties would have thought about depletion if the hearing had been held at some date in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.242" offset="5932387">So clearly the hearing in this proceeding cannot substitute for what was the party’s right under Section 7(b) at the earlier date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.737" offset="5982333">I would like to speak also to the practical problems and uncertainties so that would stem from the decision of the court below or the position of McCombs group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.168" offset="6027995">The abandonment order is a trust, a definitive reliable and public document, telling you whether the acreage is still dedicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.157" offset="6080031">There would be substitute for that, of the decision that court below, a determination by the parties I suppose whether at some point in the past people would reasonably have thought the reserves to have been depleted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.905" offset="6138964">Moreover, the court below speaks about the length of time, five years, between the last production and the new production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.146" offset="6171982">If that’s a factor how long does it have to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.506" offset="6185357">Similarly on the position of McCombs group you have to determine not only those factors, but also whether there is good faith involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.240" offset="6232377">The McCombs group also makes the point that the abandonment orders themselves may not be recordable and argue that that’s the reason for not requiring abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.177" offset="6284100">However, the problem there is not whether you can record the abandonment orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.908" offset="6303013">The real problem and the real goal is to put the producers on notice or to put subsequent lessees on notice that there is a gas purchase contract, an obligation in that respect, that was on record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.661" offset="6357974">United had filed in the land records the evidence of this contract and it indeed turn up in one of the title opinions that the producers got.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.507" offset="6401442">It's easy to find out if you are on notice to the contract whether the property has been certificated and whether an abandonment has been granted, you get from pipeline and no where else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.227" offset="6460270">Finally I would like to mention this, at one point in McCombs brief on page 19, there is a quotation in the testimony of United witness Mr. Oban that suggests that United thought and took the position that the certificate obligation terminated when the property ceased to produce 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.140" offset="6559953">That is not correct and that’s not the implication of his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.630" offset="6573850">It's not just the implication of his testimony, he says something very different in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.944" offset="6603107">The record will show that what he was talking about was United’s right as it constituted to remove a metering station because it was a gathering facility not because any certificate obligation terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.647" offset="6669981">United never took any action here that indicated that it felt that either the certificate obligation or the contract obligation had terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.409" offset="6713031">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1662.281" offset="6752528">There is a threshold issue in this case about what the Court of Appeals held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.160" offset="6771963">The Commission and United read the Court of Appeals opinion as engaging in prohibited judicial fact finding and as bypassing the Commission’s functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.005" offset="6811355">We on the other hand make no such reading of the Court of Appeal’s opinion and as I present my argument this morning I would point out the relevant aspects of the Court of Appeal’s opinion which we believe support our reading there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.159" offset="6867989">In opinion number 740, the Commission took two actions which formed the basis of the issues before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.809" offset="6894634">First, the Commission failed to grant McCombs' request to retroactively apply the Act as if Haring had applied for abandonment and had filed the proper papers in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.409" offset="6948968">Second, the court ordered McCombs to deliver gas to United on the grounds that the word service rendered as used in Section 7(b) are not to be accorded their plain meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.645" offset="6994004">On judicial review, McCombs argued to the Court of Appeals that both of these holdings constituted error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.304" offset="7024619">We believe that a proper reading of the Court of Appeals' opinion indicates that the court agreed with us on the first issue and therefore found it unnecessary to discuss the second.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.496" offset="7069341">The first issue depends on the application of equitable principle which has been worked out between the courts and the Commission and for nearly a period of 40 years and which involves -- and which does not involve the interpretation of any Federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.569" offset="7149693">This principle and the principle which was urged to the Court of Appeals was that when a party is in good faith and failing to file the proper papers with the Commission at the proper time the Commission should retroactively apply the Act as if the party had complied with the Act at the proper time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.886" offset="7234957">This principle is supported by four decisions of the Courts of Appeals cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.830" offset="7258676">I would point out that the Courts of Appeals have required the Commission to apply the principle uniformly regardless of whether it benefited or burdened the party failing to file.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.404" offset="7304965">That’s in the Niagara Mohawk case cited in our brief, the application of the principle burdened the party for the reason that it obtained a hydroelectric license for a shorter duration then it would otherwise had received.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.904" offset="7374973">However, in the Highland’s case, also cited in our brief, the party failing to file was benefited, because it achieved higher rates than it would otherwise had been permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.321" offset="7416665">Similarly, in Plaquemines and Ellwood cited in our brief, the party failing to file was benefited for the reason that they were not required to make refunds that was --</text>

            <text syncTime="1879.457" offset="7621151">I pointed out that this principle has been required by the courts to be applied in situations where both benefits and burdens the party failing to file.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.000" offset="7663365">The application of the principle involves asking the present Commission to, in the language of the Plaquemines case reconstruct the past to reflect compliance with the Act and does not therefore involve the obtaining of affidavits or sworn statements from past Commissions as to what they might have done with the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.828" offset="7754689">Moreover, the principle applies the Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act as demonstrated by the Commission’s own order in the Hewitt and (Inaudible) case which is cited in our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2236.174" offset="9048064">United removed its equipment and Haring believed that the contract was at an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.558" offset="9069589">Haring was a petroleum geologist and as I had stated testified that in 1966 neither he nor anyone else knew of any further gas reserves.</text>

            <text syncTime="2262.369" offset="9152867">Since Haring believed, the 1953 contract had been ended, he had not inform McCombs about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2677.252" offset="10812374">No Your Honor, I don’t think it is clear because if you examine the law at that time you have two cases which said that’s the Hart and the Harbor cases before the Fifth and Tenth Circuit respectively, but so -- that the petitioner, that the requirement to continue deliveries continues down to the exhausting the reserves or so long as production continues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.511" offset="10913416">In light of that I think that Haring could reasonably have felt that he didn’t have to file after it was clear to him that there were no further reserves and that the reserves which he had tried to produce were totally exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.777" offset="10982484">The second part of the two-part analysis of this equitable doctrine is, what would have been the result had the proper papers been filed at the proper time, that is when Haring’s reserves were depleted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.363" offset="11036818">The Court of Appeals had no doubt on this because it observed that in light of facts in 1966 the filing could only have been for the purpose of tidying up the Commission’s records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.784" offset="11078510">The Commission on the other hand refused to apply the Act retroactively, not because of the facts as they existed in 1966, but rather because of the facts as they existed in 1975 when the Commission issued its order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.829" offset="11142666">These facts were there in 1971 McCombs had discovered the McCaskill field which lay at depths of approximately a mile deeper than the South Porter field from which Haring had attempted to produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.166" offset="11200031">This is not like the situation in which an iron mine which has known deposits becomes economic because of -- uneconomic because of price fluctuations, but rather these were separate and unknown reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.137" offset="11263875">The Court of Appeals held that the Commission erred in this respect as a matter of law, that is the Commission the wrong evidence in applying the Act retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.099" offset="11307760">The court was correct in this because the required finding under Section 7(b) is that the available supply is depleted. And the facts are un-contradicted as I mentioned in 1966 that the available supply of natural gas was depleted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.886" offset="11382888">This finding was correct in 1966 and is not erroneous today as the Commission would suggest with the benefit of hindsight, for it remains true today that in 1966 when the finding was required to be made and the papers should have been filed, the available supply of natural gas was depleted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.914" offset="11467003">Therefore we believe the court's opinion properly understood holds that the Commission erred in failing retroactively to apply the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.466" offset="11501275">This holding does not, as the Commission in United suggest bypassed the Commission’s processes or denied interested parties the right to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.476" offset="11541295">As reflected in the Administrative Law Judge's opinion the Commission issued a notice of complaint on October 18, 1973 inviting any party desiring to be heard to file a petition to intervene or to protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.279" offset="11604511">McCombs raised the issue of retroactive abandonment in its first submitted answer filed at a date long before the hearings in this case in this language.</text>

            <text syncTime="2952.022" offset="11911502">Nor has this bypassed the Commission’s functions for the reason that the Commission was asked to exercise its powers under Section 7(b) and failed to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="3301.097" offset="13307800">This application will not upset any regulatory scheme or statutory function of the Commission, but rather it’s a matter of equitable principles addressed to these particular facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.490" offset="13357328">Your Honors, we also urge an issue, which does include statutory interpretation, that is to say that the word service rendered as set forth in Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act are to be accorded their plain meaning that is to say services rendered when delivers of natural gas are made in interstate commerce and the public as thereby relied on the reserves, which support those deliveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.193" offset="13484178">We submit that reliance is at the heart of the Section 7(b) and therefore when Haring commenced deliveries from his reserve, the public relied on the reserves quoting those deliveries and those deliveries were therefore within the scope of Section 7(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.079" offset="13563695">However, McCombs reserves which were almost a mile deeper and which were discovered at a later time were not relied upon by the public and are therefore not within the scope of Section 7(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.109" offset="13631822">We submit that the decisions of the courts show that neither the certificate nor the contract, nor the oil and gas lease is a proper measure of service rendered under Section 7(b) and we would point out and this is not pointed out in our brief that the Natural Gas Act when it was first enacted contained Section 7(b) intact, but did not contain a certificate provision except in very limited circumstances where a natural gas company wanted to serve another market, which was already being served by another natural gas company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.616" offset="13789811">So, that in our view Congress did not intend the certificate to be the measure of Section 7(b) because in the original version of the Natural Gas Act, there was no certificate provision except for very limited circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.223" offset="13864312">We believe Your Honors that the pipeline company’s right to purchase unknown reserves upon which the public has not relied was therefore intended by Congress to be left to the gas purchase contract under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.529" offset="13933484">That concludes my argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="3467.148" offset="13971937">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.180" offset="13984057">There is no basis, whatever in law or facts for respondent's claim that their alleged “good faith” requires the Commission to grant them nunc pro tunc abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.901" offset="14030973">Their claim of “good faith” that comes down even if you accept it to be true simply to an ordinary mistake of law and as Justice Marshall pointed out, if your lawyer tells you, you don’t have to file a petition for certiorari on time or you don’t have to get a drivers license or you don’t have to do anything else that statutes require you to do, that is no excuse for not doing that that you are -- the statutory requirements remain in force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.188" offset="14148106">Furthermore, there is no basis for respondent's suggestion that it is difficult for producers to find out whether the Commission is certificated particular gas sales contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.690" offset="14206098">As Mr. Bemis pointed out, the contracts are typically recorded in the Recorder of Deeds Office and any person searching a title will find the contract would have no difficulty going to the pipeline to determine or to the Commission to determine whether there is a certificate authorizing that service and whether there has been an abandonment order issued with respect to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3612.311" offset="14552586">The cases on which he relies are completely distinguishable, they involve two situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.681" offset="14570141">The first situation is where somebody has failed to comply with statutory requirements and in order to make he doesn’t get away with evading the statutory obligations, the Commission has to make a assumption that what he did, he did in fact what he should have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.038" offset="14635551">The other situation is where a person does not do something and there is reasonable reliance on the existence of the state of law at that time and then subsequently there is a change in the state of law.</text>
