            <text syncTime="77.733" offset="414281">The within matter was commenced on January 9, 1975 when the petitioner filed a petition for the dissolution of his marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.779" offset="454510">This is equivalent to a divorce in other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.258" offset="472377">The facts the stated in his petition indicated that the parties were married in September 1958 and separated in July 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.567" offset="525667">Prior to his marriage the petitioner was working for the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railroad and had been so employed since June 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.714" offset="574255">In April 1975, he changes his employment to the Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.880" offset="606856">With over 30 years of railroad connected employment, the petitioner will be eligible for his retirement benefits when he reaches age 60 he is presently 57 years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.028" offset="663489">The trial court was called upon to consider whether the future benefits are community property.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.956" offset="691179">It was the trial courts determination that there is no community interest in petitioner's railroad retirement fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.270" offset="724407">The wife filed an appeal to the California District Court of Appeals and the District Court of Appeal affirmed basing their opinion on the Supremacy Clause and the preemption of this field by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="237.949" offset="1055117">Well, I think the federal statute specifically allows the immunity of the exemption clause not to apply to the spouses support and child support provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.465" offset="1109243">So if California made a provision for spouses support and of course they could execute upon the railroad retirement fund as well as any other property.</text>

            <text syncTime="305.856" offset="1326791">Well, may it never been of a reliance on their part on the proposition that the retirement benefit was community property and therefore that the claim for alimony would be less substantial or less compelling from the point of view of the wife?</text>

            <text syncTime="326.518" offset="1409442">The sole attempt by the spouses' attorney's and they never put any evidence to this effect although they indicated in a trial brief that they intended to find the present actuarial value of the railroad retirement benefits and offset that against the house which, was ultimately awarded to the husband in this case and out of that house he is making payments to equalized the division.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.111" offset="1519783">But to my recollection there were no real attempt on their part to seek a pro-rata share.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.419" offset="1565027">The District Court of Appeals having affirmed the lower court the petitioner or the respondent in this matter they're upon petition the California Supreme Court for hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.366" offset="1612884">Hearing thereon was granted by the California Supreme Court and they reversed this matter holding an effect that the field had not been preempted and petitioner's entitlement to railroad retirement fund benefits could be subjected to the California community property laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.244" offset="1680384">Following that opinion petitioner herein filed to this Court for writ of certiorari pursuing to 28 U.S.C. 1257 (3) contesting the validity of the California community property laws requiring equal division of community property and the Federal Retirement Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.810" offset="1762617">The issue presented in this case is whether in a divorce proceeding the trial court can award any portion of the railroad connected employees future entitlement to benefits to anyone other than the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.275" offset="1816430">We are really concerned with three inquiries in deciding the issue of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.083" offset="1835656">First, does the Act of Congress touch a field in which the federal interest is so dominant at the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws?</text>
            <text syncTime="444.488" offset="1881318">Two, has Congress either explicitly or implicitly declared that the state community property laws are prohibited from regulating in this area?</text>
            <text syncTime="454.783" offset="1922487">And three and even if Congress has not completely foreclose the state legislation is the state statute void because they actually conflict with a valid Federal Act?</text>

            <text syncTime="499.109" offset="2099806">I'll get into this in a short while but they can't touch the railroad retirement benefit so whichever way California analogizes it whether community or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1557.893" offset="6334986">We look at this more narrowly that there is simply a conflict between terms of this Court and this particular application of California law to these annuity payments which are federal benefit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2975.490" offset="12005334">As is brought out in the respondent's briefs and then in the two amici briefs filed on her behalf that this Court does not under established law pursuant intent where no intent to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.843" offset="12070745">There is no indication anywhere in the legislative history thoroughly discussed in the briefs that Congress intended to preempt a state community property law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.503" offset="12113377">The existence of the spouse's benefits cited by the petitioner in his brief does not imply that Congress intended to preempt state community property law that the mere existence of that spouse's benefit is an interesting question in itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.187" offset="12188087">We believe that it was enacted in 1951 in response to the demands of the railroaders who had traditionally been receiving an amount of benefits for an excess of social security.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.890" offset="12230928">By 1950, however, Congress had amended the Social Security Act so that there was an average benefit increase of 77%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.033" offset="12263528">At this point, the railroaders who were receiving less than the social security recipients in the railroads themselves which were upset that they were contributing greater amounts of money into the railroad retirement fund than social security recipient employers would be contributing, that greater benefits were in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.651" offset="12357987">We believe that the existence of the spouses benefit was merely to an explanation for Congress' intent to provide greater benefits in order to make the railroad retirement recipients receiving more than the social security recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.612" offset="12425801">The fact that the spouses benefit terminates upon divorce, merely supplements at Section 231 (d) because at the conclusion of the marriage there is no spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.749" offset="12482330">The spouse receives a separate benefit, separate and apart from her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.226" offset="12504273">She receives a separate check.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.326" offset="12516707">This could be a good explanation for why the Court -- why the Congress determined that the spouse's benefit terminates upon divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.486" offset="12549308">Congress did not determine that the spouse is not -- is precluded under the Supremacy Clause from establishing any community property interest in husbands, right to receive the federal railroad retirement benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.671" offset="12638020">To conclude that Congress by enacting House Bill 8771 in which was signed by President Carter on September 15th and enacted as Public Law 95-366 recognizes that Congress can in effect affirm the California Supreme Court decision in this case is merely in support of respondent's argument that what California is doing does not conflict congressional intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3200.755" offset="12906350">But as pointed out by the brief filed on behalf of members of Congress, one of the objections post during the period in which the Congress was considering this piece of legislation was that community property and the state domestic relations law is really an area of state concern, not an area of federal concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.022" offset="12987434">In the area of family law, this Court frequently defers to state law in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.317" offset="13012616">It is simply not a federal -- it's not an area of federal involvement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3253.242" offset="13116374">This is contradicted on pages 22 and 23 of the brief filed on behalf of the United States in which the United States is really advanced in the argument that the federal government should somehow get involved in needs of the divorce spouses.</text>

            <text syncTime="3959.940" offset="15943137">The issue in this case is whether the United States congress in enacting the Railroad Retirement Act has indicated in clear and direct terms and intent to supersede state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3971.893" offset="15990993">The only two sections of the Railroad Retirement Act that are relied on either by the petitioner or by the Government in expressing that clear intent or the anti-assignment provisions of section 231m and the termination of the spousal benefit and the Railroad Retirement Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.484" offset="16073331">The anti-assignment provision has been mentioned earlier this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.520" offset="16097468">We believe that that provision, borrowed language from spendthrift trust ideas that was meant to protect the worker against his own failure to provide for himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.318" offset="16144593">It was to protect the worker against the claims of creditors under California law, the Supreme Court has made it clear that the wife claiming as an owner does not claim as a creditor and that there is no anticipation or assignment involved in awarding to her the property that her own.</text>
            <text syncTime="4028.101" offset="16215751">While it is true that there is, a federal question that this Court must decide as to whether that rule has been superseded, I don't believe anyone who suggested that there is a different definition of the legal terms, assignment or anticipation for the purpose of federal law and state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="4437.498" offset="17853315">The court overcame the contrary state law interest in that case because of that necessity to raise money in the public credit but in the case following Free versus Bland written by Mr. Justice White, the Yiatchos against Yiatchos.</text>

            <text syncTime="4489.290" offset="18060518">And this court said, we will not allow the federal provisions here to be used as an instrument of fraud to take away the wife's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4499.427" offset="18101060">The court used a federal definition of fraud but in looking to the content of the wife's rights, it's looked to state law to define her property rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4509.074" offset="18139617">So that it did admit that even in a case where preemption was otherwise clear, the wife's rights on the state community property law would be preserved.</text>

            <text syncTime="4548.300" offset="18296560">So the court was willing to admit in that case that the strong federal interest which it had found in Free against Bland must itself give way to federal doctrine filled with the content of state property law to prevent the wife from being defrauded her rights by an unscrupulous husband.</text>

            <text syncTime="4614.455" offset="18561233">Well, Your Honor the -- in California, we speak of community property law as domestic relations law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4619.850" offset="18582758">A community property exists only between persons who are legally married to each other and in order to have that kind of property one has to enter in to a valid marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4630.311" offset="18624658">So, that in its regulation of the rights between husband and wife California has established a community property regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="4639.418" offset="18661021">It has also permitted alimony awards to be made to either spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="4644.129" offset="18679933">And indeed, the interdependence of those two factors is very important because depending on the amount of community property awarded, the Court may vary the alimony award so that if for example in this case, the wife is awarded 20% of the railroad retirement benefits as community property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4662.746" offset="18754330">The Court will take that into account in determining how much spousal support, if any she should get and of course on the facts of this case that's not in point since the wife waived alimony but if you take a different case in which the wife did not waive alimony, the Court would take those two factors into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="4680.066" offset="18823607">And the amount of community received would go towards both diminishing her future need for support and in this case, since it comes out of the husband's railroad retirement benefits his ability to pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="4902.982" offset="19715323">The -- in conclusion, I would like to say that this case does not involve a far-reaching principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="4909.982" offset="19743326">It does not involve an effort to interfere with what the government is trying to do in the Railroad Retirement Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4916.347" offset="19768717">It merely simply refers to the right of a state court in its domestic relations law to take account of the equal contributions by both spouses to the marriage and their right to rely upon the expectation of having that labor fulfilled when the marriage is dissolved.</text>
