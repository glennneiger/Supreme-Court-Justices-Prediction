            <text syncTime="63.946" offset="359111">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.992" offset="363290">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.573" offset="377710">The issue before the Court today is whether a federal district court should issue a writ of habeas corpus when there is insufficient evidence in the state court record to convince a rational trier of fact of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.328" offset="440717">A statement of the relevant proceedings is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.739" offset="458376">The petitioner, James A. Jackson, who was tried and convicted of first-degree murder in the Circuit Court of Chesterfield County, he was sentenced to 30 years in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.850" offset="502784">Briefly, the evidence indicated that he had shot the deceased, Mrs. Mary Cole twice, that several shots were fired at the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.348" offset="544789">That he engaged in target practice that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.263" offset="556387">However, there was an extensive evidence indicating he consumed a large amount of alcohol, and shortly before the death of Mrs. Cole, the two of them had drank two-fifths of whiskey, a fifth of some other alcoholic beverage, it was not divulged in the record, and an undetermined amount of beer.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.512" offset="637471">He admitted to the shooting in the statement made to the police but indicated it was in self-defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.611" offset="661817">He then unsuccessfully appealed this case to the Virginia Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.090" offset="683760">He thereupon filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.905" offset="715003">In which he made numerous allegations, including an allegation that his conviction for first-degree murder was unsupported by evidence of premeditation.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.220" offset="760247">The District Court judge thereupon searched the record and determined that he could find no evidence of premeditation to be found.</text>

            <text syncTime="1565.049" offset="6363617">This case does present the narrow legal issue of whether or not the some evidence standard that was established in the Thompson against City of Louisville case should be overturned in favor of a rule of proof beyond a reasonable doubt upon a collateral attack by writ of habeas corpus of a Virginia or state judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.300" offset="6460583">And it is our position that those two cases are thoroughly consistent one with the other, and that as the Chief Justice has suggested, the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt has been employed in the several states for time out of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.825" offset="6518680">And in fact, is the standard in Virginia and upon review by the Virginia Supreme Court, the test is whether a rational juror could decide and hold that proof had been established beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.786" offset="6574477">We have review by transcript already in Virginia.</text>

            <text syncTime="2848.997" offset="11499395">He does it and he's familiar with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.304" offset="11508590">The question of finality that is being raised here I think is an important one because in so many other issues a person is not set free if we find ten years later that somebody didn't commit the crime because another person confesses to its remedy as executive clemency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.740" offset="11578284">It seems to me that in a state trial when a person has gone through the trial and has appealed the matter and found guilty that that should be the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.061" offset="11615587">And so I would like to conclude by saying that all I would urge the Court to consider the application of Stone against Powell, drawing the line as I have suggested on these questions of sufficiency of the evidence on the theory that if a job can be done once well there's no reason to do it twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.689" offset="11694164">If the Court does not feel that it wants to do -- make that departure, clearly the rule of Thompson against City of Louisville is applicable and is not inconsistent with In re Winship.</text>

            <text syncTime="2915.752" offset="11766366">Your Honor, just a very brief statement about what exactly we are seeking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.514" offset="11785383">We are seeking that there be a standard in habeas corpus that no -- if no rational trier of fact could've found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, then the writ of habeas corpus should issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.676" offset="11834075">In this particular case, we would ask either that the Court decide as to the facts of the case or that be remanded to the Fourth Circuit, who had already indicated that it had some doubts in its mind about the applicable law without further guidance felt they had to apply to Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.279" offset="11904502">We've either ask that the Court apply to the facts of the case or remand it for the Fourth Circuit to apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="2956.769" offset="11930415">Mrs. Colville, let me ask you one question if I might?</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.535" offset="11941491">I suppose one could apply your standard to a trial that took 20 days and had 80 witnesses and a transcript of many thousands of pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.858" offset="11978794">And is the procedure you contemplate that would just simply be submitted to the habeas judge for his perusal or referral by him to a magistrate if that was his inclination?</text>

            <text syncTime="2981.093" offset="12027695">Well, my basic inclination is that the transcript would go to the federal district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.731" offset="12050265">He would then have the benefit of the wisdom of the state court, plus the -- any pleadings found on behalf of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.791" offset="12078582">He could then look at those in order to swiftly review that particular transcript.</text>

            <text syncTime="3001.479" offset="12109302">Well I think what I'm saying is that it would be far more easier if the state says “This is where we say that there's reasonable doubt.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.859" offset="12142843">I think the court could then look at it to see if indeed this does create reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.139" offset="12163950">I think it would be an easier process if they are being guided somewhat as to what the state says the reasonable doubt exists.</text>
