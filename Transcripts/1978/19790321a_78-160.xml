            <text syncTime="2275.116" offset="9203858">In Oneida, this Court went on to discuss federal government's continuing interest in protecting the aboriginal title to Indians in their reservation land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.204" offset="9252237">Whatever the effect of this language is, it is distinguishable from the case at bar. In this case, the question is not whether the State of Iowa and the other petitioners here seek to extinguish Indian title to their aboriginal lands in violation of a federal statute because the Indian's possession of the land was extinguished by the physical action of the Missouri River over a century ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.079" offset="9387656">The question here is whether Indian land is affected by the same law of accretion and avulsion that uniformly affects the property rights of the State of Iowa and the other peti-- riparian owners in this same locality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.880" offset="9462888">United States v. Oklahoma Gas Company is more pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.046" offset="9483577">In that case, the question before this Court was whether the federal authority to construct a highway through tribal land, held in trust by the United States Government, included the right to erect electrical transmission lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.010" offset="9555362">This Court held that a conveyance by the United States of land which it owns beneficially for Indians is to be construed according to the law of the state where the land lies, unless an expressed congressional intention to the contrary is shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.265" offset="9632475">The Court pointed out application of different federal law was not necessary to protect the Indians from their own improvidence or from overreaching by others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.499" offset="9677406">The Court pointed out the same law applied to Indians and to non-Indians alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.466" offset="9717217">The Court continued with the observation that Oklahoma is spotted with restricted lands held in trust for Indian lotees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.738" offset="9754311">Complications and confusion would follow from applying rules differing from those which obtain as to lands of non-Indians and that the Court believes that if the Congress had intended this, they would have made its meaning clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.967" offset="9823274">Exactly that same reasoning is applicable in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.116" offset="9843858">So, the fundamental issue to be decided by this Court is whether federal interest requires application of new federal common law radically different from local law in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.861" offset="9898820">The Court of Appeals and the respondents argue that it is required because the case involves an interstate boundary and because there is a special interest of the United States Government in protecting reservation lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.646" offset="9957961">Both of these contentions are incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.002" offset="9971336">There is no interstate boundary involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.935" offset="9987114">The boundary between Iowa and Nebraska was fixed by a compact in 1943.</text>

            <text syncTime="2599.119" offset="10499845">Also, there is no special interest of the United States Government in protecting the aboriginal rights of the Omaha Indian Tribe in this case either because the tribe was denied possession of this land a century ago by the physical action of the Missouri River and not by any action involving the State of Iowa or these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.246" offset="10624397">The same law applies to the Omaha Indian Tribe as applies to the other riparian owners in the same locality.</text>

            <text syncTime="4248.203" offset="17096182">I would like to cover both the statutory question and the choice of law question during the course of my argument, and I would propose to turn first to the statutory questions since they do provide a backdrop for the consideration of the choice of law question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4263.246" offset="17156368">This morning's questions raise one point that I'd like to clear up immediately in the terms of the application of Section 194 to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4273.912" offset="17199000">That was a threshold question of is this the kind of case where the United States and the tribe could have shown previous possession or ownership in order to invoke the presumption of Section 194, and a suggestion was made or the question was raised if it's the kind of case where the allegations are that the land that the United States and the tribe were seeking was destroyed, does that mean that the showing initially made to-- or required to invoke the presumption is the same showing that's required to prevail in the case as a whole and that it's circular, in that, we've not made out our initial burden of claiming the applicability of the statute? We think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4319.562" offset="17381648">We think that when the tribe and the United States showed that the land at these “meets and bounds,” “under the sky,” however one would want to describe it, the property at that location was part of the reservation where title-- legal title was held by the United States and the beneficial ownership was in the Omaha Indian Tribe that we've shown previous possession or ownership as of 1867.</text>

            <text syncTime="4377.384" offset="17612884">I think it is, surely.</text>
            <text syncTime="4379.124" offset="17619884">I think it is and, therefore, we think that the question here is “did some events occur after the time of our pre-- possession and ownership, which we have shown?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4390.189" offset="17664084">That would be given legal effect to cut off the ownership of the tribe and of the United States on behalf of the tribe, just as if we have shown that we had previous possession and ownership in 1867 and there was a conveyance whose validity was disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4403.883" offset="17718941">The question would be, because of those events, did we or did we not lose title?</text>
            <text syncTime="4408.085" offset="17735764">By the same token, we think we've shown that this property was held by the United States for the tribe in 1867 and then the question is, given the presumption that their ownership continued, were there events that occurred which had the legal effect of cutting off that title?</text>
            <text syncTime="4426.262" offset="17808384">As the Court knows from some of its previous cases, Congress passed a series of statutes to regulate trade and interaction between Indian tribes and non-Indians and to protect the peaceful possession of Indian lands in the 1790s and in the early 1800s.</text>
            <text syncTime="4445.175" offset="17884035">Section 194 was added as an amendment in 1822 to the current version of the Non-Intercourse Act, and we think its clear policy and intent was to play a role in protecting the possession and the ownership of these Indian lands against dubious or questionable claims by non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="4467.347" offset="17972746">And, we think that overall intent and purpose, that protective purpose, has to be kept in mind in construing the particular questions that the petitioners have raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="4478.101" offset="18015796">The first set of questions that they have raised is, who may invoke the protection of Section 194? The statute itself says when an Indian is a party, “when an Indian,” and he makes out a presumption of title in himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.712" offset="18074206">Now, we don't think that, by using the singular term “an Indian,” Congress meant to preclude either one, two, or three Indians, the-- a tribe which is a group of Indians, or the United States as trustee for either an individual Indian or for the tribe to prevent that those-- any of those claimants from invoking the protection of 194 when a non-Indian claimant makes a challenge to lands that were originally owned by the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="4521.908" offset="18191026">We think that, consistent with the clear policy, one would give that singular word “an Indian” the meaning that would include the United States and the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="4532.338" offset="18232717">And, we think that is consistent with the normal rule of construction in 1 USC 1 which says, as a general matter, singular words ha-- mean the same as plural words.</text>
            <text syncTime="4541.824" offset="18270647">They are used interchangeably.</text>
            <text syncTime="4543.611" offset="18277857">Now, the question is whether there is anything in the legislative history or in the remainder of the text of the 1832-- 1834 or 1822 versions of the Non-Intercourse Act that shows some narrower intent by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4557.483" offset="18333341">Is there anything specific that would show that they-- instead of meaning it-- that the Act should have this broader application but that, instead, it should only mean “an Indian”?</text>

            <text syncTime="4621.982" offset="18591326">Well, I was starting with “an Indian,” but I also do want to get to “a White person.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4627.396" offset="18612955">And, my point was merely that, as a general rule, one-- in looking at a statute such as this, not only from the policy point of view but from the rule of general construction, one would assume that the word would be broad enough to include the tribes and the United States when it's representing interests of a single Indian or a tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="4647.382" offset="18692890">And, we have dealt with in our brief the question of comparing this section to other portions of the 1834 Act in which it was included.</text>
            <text syncTime="4657.258" offset="18732387">There's a suggestion that, by comparing this particular provision to either Section 12 or to other provisions, one comes to the conclusion that there was a definite intent to narrow the meaning of Section 194.</text>
            <text syncTime="4672.238" offset="18792364">That it was narrowed from the terms that were used in the 1822 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4677.647" offset="18813994">As discussed this morning, the 1822 Act used not only the term “an Indian,” but also a plural term “Indians.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4684.792" offset="18842520">Why did Congress change it in 1834?</text>
            <text syncTime="4687.826" offset="18854640">We think that the only reason they changed it was to make the language of the section consistent throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.609" offset="18877837">There's nothing in the legislative history that shows any other intent and we don't find any of the guess work very persuasive to really suggest that there was some other intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4704.051" offset="18919528">We have found one report from that period which was designed as a model of the amendment of all the Indian statutes and it shows the precise change that Congress made here between 1822 and 1834, and it indicates that no intent wa-- that there was no intent to change the meaning of that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="4724.145" offset="18999986">We think it was just to clean up the syntax.</text>
            <text syncTime="4726.615" offset="19009808">And, we would question the Court against holding Section194 up against the other provisions of the 1834 Act and finding that because the term “Indian tribe” is used in some of those other provisions that that would show an intent not to include “Indian tribe” here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4743.998" offset="19079398">We think it's pretty clear from looking at that 1822 language that Congress was not very careful and precise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.844" offset="19106774">In the same statute it said “an Indian,” “Indians,” “White persons,” “a White person,” “himself.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.944" offset="19135195">It's not a carefully drafted provision and, if one looks at the 1832 Act-- the 1834 Act, again, the terminology varies very greatly from section to section.</text>
            <text syncTime="4769.496" offset="19181380">These sections were pulled from different enactments, some in 1796, some in 1822, and they didn't make the language consistent throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="4778.218" offset="19216280">So, we would say, looking at this provision in 1822, giving effect to the intent of Congress and the general rule of construction, that it should be applied to a group of Indians, a single Indian, and the United States on behalf of the tribe.</text>

            <text syncTime="4817.111" offset="19371865">Now, granted the United States as a representative of the tribe would be more familiar with Court rules and Court procedures and would have more resources, but I don't think that there should be a rule that would cut against or discourage the United States from helping out an Indian tribe or a single Indian from enforcing his rights, and I think that the purpose of protecting Indian lands is the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="4897.964" offset="19695261">We haven't found anything that would back up that suggestion and, indeed, the citation to the Cohen article-- the Cohen Handbook suggest to the contrary that, although Indian tribes were not considered to be a foreign nation in that sense for jurisdictional purposes, that they were coming into Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="5476.714" offset="22010232">I would think that they should be but we have both points here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5480.333" offset="22024756">Not only do we have a reservation established by federal law, but this was the aboriginal home of the Omaha Indian, so that, to the extent that that's a necessary ingredient, we clearly have that ingredient here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5493.033" offset="22075538">And, we don't find any inconsistency between the decision in Oneida on the one hand, and the decision in Corvallis which petitioners rely upon on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="5501.852" offset="22110751">Corvallis says only, as we read it, that when there is no federal interest requiring the displacement of state law, local property law controls the ownership and the incidence of ownership of land along a waterway, a stream, a river, and what we are saying and what Oneida holds is that there is a continuing federal interest requiring the displacement of state law when it is a question of Indian reservation title, aboriginal title perhaps also, as well as federally conferred and protected rights to Indian possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="5542.077" offset="22271666">And, additionally, I think we would point to the portion of the Corvallis decision which notes that when the question is not what happens after a federal patent has issued but has title gone from the federal government to a patentee or, in this case, to other kinds of claimants, that question, whether federal ownership has passed, is always one of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5569.279" offset="22380440">Wilcox v. Jackson, very early cases, established the proposition that when a question is a termination or not a federal interest, the passing of title from the federal government that, again, federal law always governs that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5582.640" offset="22433938">So, we find ourselves very comfortable in the Corvallis for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="5587.787" offset="22454523">It's wholly consistent with the special rule for Indian title and the special rule for considering whether federal title has been terminated or has passed.</text>

            <text syncTime="5596.841" offset="22490781">So, suppose there's a navigable river inside a state, it's not a boundary river, and there's an Indian reservation on one side of the stream and just west of it is a federal military installation and then there's a national forest on the same side of the stream, all in a row.</text>
            <text syncTime="5618.090" offset="22575731">And then, there are a series of changes in the river and there's private ownership on the other side, not in the-- and there's a-- and the river changes like it did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5630.419" offset="22625050">You say federal law applies in each of those cases as to whether there's avulsion or accretion?</text>

            <text syncTime="5644.345" offset="22680743">Well, I would say two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="5646.032" offset="22687535">I think, in its citation of Wilcox v. Jackson, Corvallis does suggest that the question of whether federal title has been lost is always the question of federal law but even if we're not right on that, even if merely the federal ownership of public domain lands is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="5661.697" offset="22750124">I think Oneida clearly establishes that there's an additional peg to our argument when we're speaking of federally protected Indian lands where Congress has specifically moved to oust the states of jurisdiction in has specifically claimed for itself the question of when federal-- when and how Indian rights may be terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5684.343" offset="22840717">So, we think that tha-- that it's an easy-- the easiest case for us is the Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5689.050" offset="22859525">Now, we would read Wilcox v. Jackson and Corvallis is saying, at least when there's federal ownership, the question whether our title is lost at least would also be federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="5712.452" offset="22953148">It says, accordingly, the question whether Indian title to a portion of a reservation has been lost must be determined by the application of federal common law which embodies the sum of federal law making on the issues and interests involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5727.837" offset="23014693">Am I to understand from that that, entirely apart from the Non-Intercourse Act, that it may be a “heads I win, tails you lose situation” when Indians are involved that is the-- precisely the same historical facts may take place but j-- by reason of “federal common law,” the Indians would win in each case?</text>
