            <text syncTime="12.830" offset="155752">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.934" offset="172157">This is a case of first impression as far as this Court is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.426" offset="198071">It is a case involving the interpretation and application of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which establishes a broad duty on recipients of federal aid and assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.955" offset="268184">Not to discriminate against handicapped persons, against qualified handicapped persons solely because of their handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.111" offset="312801">I think it essential at the outset to note that this is not a case of discrimination against a handicapped person.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.196" offset="361179">This is a case rather of a handicapped person who has been found not qualified to participate in the program or activity to which she sought admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.480" offset="430352">The uncontested facts as found by the District Court after an evidentiary hearing, facts and findings which have not been challenged in the lower courts or essentially before this Court established that the respondent, Frances Davis, by concession had a severe hearing handicap which made it impossible for her to communicate with other people other than with the use of a hearing aid and the ability and necessity to read the lips of the person to whom she is talking.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.405" offset="637973">And she must apparently be face to face with the talker.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eugene Gressman</label>
            <text syncTime="148.154" offset="697010">That is essentially the finding implicit in the District Court's opinion, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.510" offset="734417">It was a combination though of the hearing handicap -- of I mean the hearing aid plus the necessity to read lips, and even then that was found to be an inadequate compensation for the severity of a hearing handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.613" offset="802858">Now --</text>

            <text syncTime="204.173" offset="921140">Is there anything in the record that protects the public when a licensed registered nurse becomes handicapped as this respondent was after her licensure had been obtained?</text>

            <text syncTime="220.631" offset="986969">Under the North Carolina statutes, the state licensing bureau is authorize to revoke any license it has previously granted because of incompetent or inadequate nursing practice under any license, whether it be an LPN license or an RN license.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.088" offset="1084771">That is very clearly set forth in the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.346" offset="1093757">That's a -- I would assume that's a fairly universal provision with respect to any licensing activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="268.958" offset="1180275">This is solely a, you might say an ad hoc factual development solely related to this particular individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.321" offset="1217682">We have no evidence as to the general practices of the licensing authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.574" offset="1242655">Now the court made the critical determinations, in terms of this respondent's lack of qualifications either to participate in the training program or in her ultimate profession as a registered nurse.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.651" offset="1335024">The court specifically found that her hearing handicap actually prevents her from safely performing in both her training program and her proposed registered nurse profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.852" offset="1407854">And the court found and concluded that there are numerous situations where her hearing disability would render her unable to function properly in a clinical situation, in a nurse-patient relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.454" offset="1482250">And finally, the court emphasized that was a particular concern to this Court was the potential danger to the patients in the hospitals who would be unable to in many situations communicate effectively with this particular nurse-trainee or ultimately the professional nurse.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.910" offset="1615997">Many patients obviously are not incapable of addressing the nurse face to face so that their lips could be read, or there might be situations where various crises develop that could only be -- that could not be heard by the nurse who had her back turned to in a particular situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="736.448" offset="3050224">One is to be a registered nurse because it might be dangerous for her if she couldn't hear properly, and secondly she might not be able to do this study program adequately.</text>

            <text syncTime="788.947" offset="3260144">The state licensing bureau head who wrote a letter, it's in the record, said that she could not exactly predict what would be the situation two or three years hence when this person, if she got through the training program, would then be eligible to take a licensing examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.566" offset="3346662">But she said that on the basis of her present knowledge, she assumed that it would be improper and perhaps run undue risk to permit her to participate in the training program.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.041" offset="3428582">And the likelihood was that if this condition remained the same after she were to have completed her training program, there would be a serious question whether they would let her take the licensing examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.245" offset="3497336">You see, the licensing authorities do not have any independent sifting out process.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.242" offset="3521369">They simply take the graduates of the nursing schools that have been certified to them as fully competent, fully qualified nurses -- nurse candidates who are completely able to fulfill all the requirements that a registered nurse must have.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.009" offset="3624396">And they simply take that and allow them on basis to that certification from an accredited nursing program to take the licensing exam, and if they -- which is simply a written examination, there is no physical test made by the licensing authorities, then that person if she passes the written examination is given a RN license.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.348" offset="3745813">Now, I think it's essential to see how the structure of Section 504 comes into play at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.711" offset="3803282">It's a very simple proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.052" offset="3832644">The opening words of 504 say that “No otherwise qualified handicapped individual shall solely by reason of his handicap be excluded from participation or otherwise discriminated against in any federally funded program or activity.”</text>
            <text syncTime="956.449" offset="3930237">Now, the essential predicate in other words for 504 coming into operation at all is that the person be otherwise qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.160" offset="3969003">Those are the predicate words that bring 504 into operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.725" offset="3999305">Unless you have a qualified handicapped person, you can never have the kind of discrimination against that person that 504 is talking about.</text>

            <text syncTime="1111.466" offset="4550280">You have to look at the particular nature of the handicap and see whether that is relevant to the qualifications, and you have to look at -- determine whether ultimately there's been discrimination against the person once he has been determined he is qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.642" offset="4634917">We never get to that point in this case because we never got above -- beyond the predicate requirement that the person be otherwise qualified.</text>

            <text syncTime="1212.709" offset="4955282">In those types of programs which are the great mass that are covered by 504, there ordinarily are not any physical qualifications.</text>

            <text syncTime="1488.151" offset="6057023">I would say one final word as to the interpretation of 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.667" offset="6091086">It simply does not apply in my judgment to any a cause of action which involves a person who is found not to be qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.702" offset="6147197">And I think that the person who is not qualified in a -- for a participation in a clinical program raises a most serious policy considerations, because once you leave the academic area where physical qualifications are no longer an issue, indeed they do be -- go into the clinical areas where physical qualifications may be important to the public safety, health and welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.431" offset="6302156">Then it seems to me you are outside the intended scope of the language and the purpose of 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.959" offset="6336219">Now, we have in this situation a reflection of this concern by the District Court for the safety of the patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.322" offset="6369656">And I think that a person who is unqualified to provide safe nursing care for the great mass of individuals who are ill and sick raises a serious question as to whether this 504 duty should be imposed indiscriminately upon that kind of program or activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.518" offset="6490446">Congress has from the very beginning established a policy that is very much in point here, and I refer to the statutes in my reply brief that under the Nurse Training Act of 1964 which provides for financial assistance to nursing schools, and which is the very assistance that was given to Southeastern Community College in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.783" offset="6615521">That is why it is federally funded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.259" offset="6625447">It was federally funded to provide safe nursing practice and training.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.943" offset="6660138">But Congress in that Act said that in no event shall there be any condition or imposition by the federal authorities of any changes in the curriculum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.230" offset="6737356">In other words, any kind of affirmative accommodation that Your Honor spoke of a few minutes ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.551" offset="6766613">They were concerned that you maintain the quality and the safety of nurse training programs, and there was to be no interference with changing the curricular or the administration of this highly important and high risk type of clinical training programs in the nursing school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.551" offset="6870580">And Congress has also told us in another statute in the education amendments of 1974 that if the handicapped people want to participate in these kinds of clinical programs, Congress authorizes grants and expenditures to community colleges and other institutions to establish specially designed programs for the seriously handicapped who can not be qualified in terms of the ordinary program.</text>

            <text syncTime="1749.559" offset="7102652">In 1978 the Rehabilitation Act was amended to provide for two specific kinds of private causes of action with respect to it the federal employees and those who are employed by the a recipient funds in a narrow employment context where the primary purpose of the grant is to foster and provide for creating employment relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.958" offset="7256252">Now, it seems to me that the very specificity with which it authorized private causes of action in those two instances by necessary implication reads out any kind of private cause of action for other situations such as we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.864" offset="7351860">Since we do have a federal employee or do we have an employment type situation, Congress has said as clearly as it can, I assume that there are to be no other types of private causes of action.</text>
