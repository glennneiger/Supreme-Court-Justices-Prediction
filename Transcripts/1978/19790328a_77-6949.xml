            <text syncTime="201.051" offset="907577">Petitioners before the Court today to present three primary questions: Whether a sworn statement taken in a private attorneys office may be deemed a proceeding ancillary to U.S. Court or grand jury in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1623?</text>
            <text syncTime="217.767" offset="974451">Can immunized testimony be used against the witness to establish the corpus delicti of an inconsistent declarations prosecution without proof that the witness testified falsely under immunity?</text>
            <text syncTime="229.814" offset="1022621">And did the appellate court in this case adopt a proper theory in sustaining the conviction of Mr. Dunn?</text>
            <text syncTime="237.061" offset="1051564">Your Honor, petitioner submits that all three issues must be resolved against him before the conviction can stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.446" offset="1077164">The underlying case proceeded as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.346" offset="1088763">Mr. Dunn appeared before federal grand jury in Denver, Colorado on June 16, 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.775" offset="1114467">He claimed his right to remain silent and subsequently was ordered to appear before United States District Judge whereupon he was granted use immunity under 18 United States Code Section 6002.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.728" offset="1166294">He thereafter reappeared and testified the certain drug activities at the Colorado State Penitentiary implicating one Phillip Musgrave and several other co-defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.617" offset="1201821">As a result, an indictment was returned against Musgrave and three other co-defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.032" offset="1223450">On September 30, 1976, he appeared in the office of Musgrave's attorney, Michael Canges and proceeded to recant his grand jury testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.770" offset="1262425">Present was a notary public who administered the oath and recorded Mr. Dunn's statement by virtue of a tape-recording.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.577" offset="1305684">It was subsequently reduced to writing and tendered to the U.S.District Court --</text>

            <text syncTime="309.210" offset="1340165">Your Honor, although the record is silent as to this, I believe the evidence would indicate that Mr. Dunn met Mr. Musgrave and then proceeded to strike a deal with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.704" offset="1390216">Subsequently, wound up in his attorney's office, Mr. Musgrave's attorney's office and recanted what he had told to -- what he had told to the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.715" offset="1430235">The statement was reduced to writing and tendered to the Court as an exhibit in support of a motion to dismiss the indictment against Musgrave.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.346" offset="1460746">On October 21, 1976, a hearing on that motion was held in the United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.088" offset="1483734">Dunn was called as a witness and once again reaffirmed the affidavit even though he'd indicated he had not totally reviewed it.</text>

            <text syncTime="388.948" offset="1659173">Each declaration that he made before the grand jury was not proceeded through and it was the conclusory remark that 90% of it was false which we may infer.</text>

            <text syncTime="411.777" offset="1750497">Now, that's one of our basic contentions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.662" offset="1761991">The October 21st proceeding in U.S. District Court was not alleged to be an ancillary proceeding in this inconsistent declarations prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.298" offset="1796577">And even though the appellate court affirmed the conviction by looking to that proceeding and indicating that Dunn by adopting that statement had somehow turned the September 30th proceeding into an ancillary proceeding, we submit that was outside the indictment and improper amendment or prejudicial variance from the indictment.</text>

            <text syncTime="769.769" offset="3182425">On cross-examination, the clerk was asked to identify the immunity order and application identify his defendant's exhibit F-1 and F-2 entered prior to Dunn's appearance and testimony before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.190" offset="3236133">The notary republic was then called to the stand and asked to identify the September 30th Kansas statement which had been rendered on September 30, 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.775" offset="3274480">He indicated however on cross-examination that Dunn did not have counsel of his own choosing in the office of Musgrave's attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.685" offset="3306141">He was not familiar with the criminal deposition procedures under 18 U.S.C. Section 3503, no court order had been obtained for the taking of this disposition, and there was no indication that Dunn would be unavailable for trial which we submit are necessary requirements for this document to qualify as deposition under 3503.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.145" offset="3383986">Upon the Government's office, the Kansas statement, the defense objected, it did not qualify his proceedings ancillary or before a U.S. Court of Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.521" offset="3421497">The Government next introduced Dunn's grand jury testimony through the Assistant United States Attorney who conducted the Musgrave grand jury investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.271" offset="3456502">On cross-examination, however, the Assistant United States Attorney admitted that there was no independent evidence but for Dunn's recantations of September 30th and October 21st to disbelieve the grand jury testimony and that there was much evidence to corroborate the truth of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.115" offset="3527868">The defense objected to the use of the grand jury's testimony on the basis that was in violation of his immunity order.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.613" offset="3549811">Both of those objections were overruled and both exhibits were admitted into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.560" offset="3569664">Then the Government further offered the transcript of the October 21, 1976 evidentiary hearing in U.S. District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.090" offset="3599757">The defense objected that these declarations were not outlined in the allegations of the indictment that it was beyond the proper scope of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.300" offset="3644583">The Government did concede that prior to trial this evidence had not been submitted to the defense and was not intended as evidence in the case in chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.696" offset="3678124">His response was since we have cross-examined the Assistant U.S. Attorney as to the truthfulness of the grand jury testimony he wanted to offset that testimony by use of the subsequent reaffirmation to lend credence to the September 30th statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.551" offset="3737579">The Government rested then elected not to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.900" offset="3754924">Defense then move for judgment of acquittal on two bases that the immunized grand jury testimony could not be used against him to establish the corpus delicti and in inconsistent declaration prosecution and that the Canges' statement was not an ancillary proceeding under Section 1623.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.188" offset="3824097">The trial court ruled that the Canges' statement if not originally ancillary “channels its way into being an ancillary proceeding” upon the confirmation in U.S. District Court on October 21st.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.063" offset="3891597">However, United States Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with Dunn's position and said that the September 30th statement was not ancillary proceeding as the statute requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.895" offset="3934960">The Court however found that the October 21st proceeding was ancillary and affirmed the conviction on that basis even though that proceeding had not been set out in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.441" offset="3977174">The Court found “it was a proceeding ancillary to the grand jury because of Dunn's subsequent affirmation and adoption of the earlier statement on October 21st.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.876" offset="4026911">In other words, look to the October 21st proceeding as an affirmation of the earlier September 30th proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.546" offset="4053556">The Court held that its admission, the October 21st statement into evidence was not a prejudicial variance because the defense would have contemplated.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.926" offset="4087097">Now, Your Honor, we submit that the -- since the indictment charge the June 16th and the September 30th statements as being proceedings either before or ancillary to U.S. Court or grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.942" offset="4139133">It set out the declarations in each of those two proceedings which were alleged to be consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.464" offset="4161181">The only question for the jury was where the declarations in those two separate proceedings so inherently inconsistent that one of them had to be false.</text>

            <text syncTime="1123.738" offset="4598366">Your Honor, if I might address further response to his Honor, Mr. Justice Rehnquist questions with regard to whether or not defendant Dunn was prejudiced by the Government's action in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.582" offset="4645700">I would submit that if the Court finds a constructive amendment to the indictment in this case under the reasoning of Stirone versus United States prejudiced need not be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.474" offset="4685302">However, if the Court feels that the proceedings in which the Government introduced evidence against Mr. Dunn particularly the October 21st proceedings were merely a variance in pleading and proof, then we submit that prejudice would have to be found under that reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.906" offset="4758967">Your Honor, with regard to this Stirone case I would submit that the prejudice against Dunn may be more grievous than Mr. Stirone realized in -- under the facts underlying that case, the Court recall in Stirone that the defendant was charged the Hobbs Act violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.106" offset="4835767">And the specific allegation in the indictment was the interstate commerce of particular portion of the allegation which concern shipping sand into the State of Pennsylvania to construct a steel plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.189" offset="4888116">However, trial the Government instead prove that steel was going to be shipped out of Pennsylvania and that was the interstate element of the jury you should look to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.718" offset="4930226">And this Honorable Court in that particular proceeding found that while there was a variance in the sense of the variation between pleading and proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.504" offset="4965439">The variation here destroyed the defendant's substantial right to be tried only on those charges presented in an indictment returned by a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.798" offset="5002533">For further stated deprivation of such a basic right is far too serious to be treated as nothing more than a variance and then dismiss this harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.939" offset="5035133">I would submit the Stirone case has been properly referred to as constructive amendment even though I would interpret the Court's language to proceed on a prejudicial variance basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.480" offset="5085288">Your Honor, the Tenth Circuit also determined aside from the ancillary issue that Dunn has immunized testimony could be used against him in an inconsistent declarations prosecution because his subsequent affirmation first of all is recantation in the September 30th proceeding in the subsequent affirmation in the October 20th proceeding contained the admission by him that his grand jury testimony was false and it was due to this possible conclusion that the defense on cross-examination of the Assistant United States Attorney at trial established that there was independent evidence to believe the truthfulness of the grand jury testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.984" offset="5255293">Even though Dunn had subsequently recanted and that there was reasonably the subsequent recantations may in fact been false.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.034" offset="5283506">However, the theory throughout this case was inconsistent declarations and the Government never attempted to prove that his grand jury testimony was false under the 1623 --</text>

            <text syncTime="1896.489" offset="7689279">Now, the question before this Court is whether petition is perjury palpable on its face from a comparison of the contradictory statements may be proved by placing those statements before the jury or whether the immunity granted in connection with the first of those statements preclude such a course of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.792" offset="7774542">Now the case also involves an issue about whether the September 30th statement in Musgrave's lawyer's office was a proceeding ancillary to a court and if not whether that is fatal to the prosecution in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.885" offset="7854895">I intend to rely on our brief on those points unless the Court has any questions and move on to the more important constitutional immunity point.</text>

            <text syncTime="2612.888" offset="10554911">Now turning to that issue, our position on the constitutionality of the use that we made of petitioner's immunized grand jury testimony in this case is the product that two propositions both of which we believe to be reasonably well-settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.174" offset="10632025">Now, the first proposition is that the immunity that must be granted to displace a valid claim of the privilege against self-incrimination has to be co-extensive with but need not be any broader than the scope of the privilege which was available to the witness at the time he invoked it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.421" offset="10705063">In other words, when the Government seeks to make some use of compelled testimony against the witness who gave that testimony, the permissibility of making that use can be ascertained by asking yourself the question, could he have invoked the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination to refuse to answer to guard against this prospective use of his testimony?</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.992" offset="10811329">Now, the second proposition on which we rests is that at the time petitioner was called to testify before the grand jury and invoked his privilege, he could not have validly invoked his privilege on the grounds that later on he might choose to give contradictory testimony and he did not want to create evidence now that could be used to show the falsity of subsequent non-immunized testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.151" offset="10923969">Now, if those two propositions are accepted I think we win the case and I don't understand petitioner to contest the second of those that is that he could not have invoked the privilege solely on the ground of a possible future perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.229" offset="10980289">He does stoutly maintain, however, that his immunity is sweeping regardless of the scope of his privilege at the time he acquired the immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.907" offset="11018951">In other words, he says he invalidly invoked the privilege with regard to his drug dealings at the Colorado State Penitentiary, something that we don't dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.023" offset="11055417">Consequently, he says the Government may not make any use of his immunized testimony but must leave him in the same position as if he had not been compelled to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.206" offset="11092198">So the question before the Court is whether a valid claim of the privilege gives them immunity buff as to any criminal case used of immunized testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.234" offset="11136293">Or as we argue, does it only provide immunity co-extensive with the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.567" offset="11165654">Now, the Court's prior decision looked our way on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.102" offset="11183731">Nearly 70 years ago, in Glickstein and in Heike, the Court stated the basic principle that is central to our constitutional analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.949" offset="11223124">For instance in Glickstein, the Court said that the immunity of course is required to be complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.874" offset="11250918">That is to say, in all respects commensurate with the protection guaranteed by the constitutional limitation referring to the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.378" offset="11288848">In Heike, the Court said that in order to avoid giving what it called a gratuity to crime, the immunity afforded under the statute that was there in question should be construed and I quote, “as co-terminus with what otherwise would have been the privilege of the person concerned.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.306" offset="11364603">Now, this same theme of symmetry between the privilege and the immunity also underlie this Court's decisions in Murphy against the Waterfront Commission and in Kastigar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.219" offset="11416221">I think that it is clear from those decisions that the Court has held that what the Constitution requires in the way of immunity is defined by the privilege that the witness has.</text>

            <text syncTime="2939.983" offset="11863333">Now, the fallacy and the notion that he should be in the same position as if he'd been allowed to remain silent is illustrated by the fact that he can prosecuted for perjury in making those statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.445" offset="11909204">He clearly is not in the same position as if he had remained silent and looking one step beyond that, why is it that he can be prosecuted for perjury?</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.446" offset="11949119">Well, I think the reason why he can be prosecuted for perjury is that his privilege did not entitle him to commit perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.305" offset="11972629">He couldn't invoke the privilege on the grounds that his statements might be false be used against him in perjury prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.883" offset="11998856">Now, we say the very same thing is true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.934" offset="12011081">He could not invoke his privilege on the guard against the use that we have made of his testimony in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.737" offset="12042324">So therefore, I don't -- I don't think his argument is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.215" offset="12052250">Now, we also illustrate our point by looking at the situation with transactional immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.467" offset="12073253">I think it was clear in Kastigar and the cases before Kastigar that transactional immunity satisfied the requirements of the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.765" offset="12118392">If that statute no longer allows it but if petitioner had been given transaction immunity, as once was permitted, his statements could have been used against them to prove a subsequent perjury because the transactional immunity would have been with regard to the offenses about which he was being compelled to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.577" offset="12197700">Now, his answer to this analysis is to invoke certain language in Kastigar and in Portash.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.504" offset="12229360">But we don't think that language was addressed to the problem that we have in this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.057" offset="12263633">The Court was not examining in that case the question of whether the immunity must exceed the scope of the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.911" offset="12291009">In both cases, what the Court was talking about was the uses that the witness would have been privileged to resist at the time testimony was compelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.491" offset="12329357">In Kastigar, the Court was concerned with whether use and derivative use immunity was sufficient to displace the privilege and in that respect the Court was comparing it with transaction immunity and the Court was saying that use and derivative use immunity since it protects use in any respect of his evidence is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.486" offset="12409292">Clearly, they were focusing on use to prove the crime about which he was required to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.700" offset="12434160">Now, Portash is exactly the same situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.862" offset="12446804">It's clear from the court's holding that Portash had a right to invoke his privilege against self-incrimination to guard against the use of compelled testimony to impeach and surely be prosecuted for the crimes about which he testified so that this case is completely different and you can't simply lift that language out of those cases and in effect, I think automatically are unthinkingly applied to this quite different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.576" offset="12561638">Now, even if the Constitution permits the kind of use immunized testimony that was made in the present case, there does remain a question whether such use is brought by the immunity statute Section 6002.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.168" offset="12616077">Now, we of course contend that the statute does not bar this use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.523" offset="12633422">Now at part, we rely on the explicit inclusion in the last clause of Section 6002 of false statement prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.263" offset="12676472">But these are more fundamental point that shows that the statute is no bar to the kind of use made here so long as that use is constitutionally permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.099" offset="12711790">This Court has construed immunity provisions like that in 6002 and a number of prior cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.471" offset="12745226">In Glickstein for instance, it was confronted with the statute which barred used of immunized testimony in any proceeding and it held that that statute that did not bar use in a perjury prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.927" offset="12799039">And in Bryan, the Court held that a statute which barred any use “except in a prosecution for perjury” did not bar use in a contempt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.073" offset="12843656">Now in both of those cases, the Court recognized that the kind of language that were dealing with the immunity statute here refers to use in connection with the prosecution for the offense that is disclosed by the testimony itself and not for future offenses such as contempt or perjury as to which the privilege was unavailable at the time of the compelled testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.518" offset="12941458">Now, the Court in this case should analyze the proviso of the Section 6002 in precisely the same manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.272" offset="12968417">And if it does so, it will be giving to that statute the meaning that Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.090" offset="12995688">The immunity statute was based on -- closely on the report of the National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.915" offset="13031006">That Commission proposed that “the immunity conferred be confine to the scope required by the Fifth Amendment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.905" offset="13062980">And both the House and Senate Report stated explicitly, “this statutory immunity is intended to be as broad as but no broader than the privilege against self-incrimination.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.987" offset="13115329">Now the last clause in Section 6002 which specifically list perjury false statement and the third clause which I think basically they had in mind, contempt cases was added not as a limitation on the use that could be made of immunized testimony but out of an abundance of caution to make sure that no court would prohibit as long as the constitutional allowed it but no court would prohibit the use in a perjury case or a false statement case or a contempt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.638" offset="13253883">Now, the same policy concerns that led the Court in Glickstein and in Bryan to refused to read limitation into the immunity statutes in those cases are also operative here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.828" offset="13302680">In effect, what the Court said in Glickstein and in Bryan is Congress can't really have meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.510" offset="13325458">We can't believe that Congress meant to protect the defendant or the witness against a perjury or a contempt prosecution even though the Constitution doesn't require it because that would defeat in large part the purpose of giving him the immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.499" offset="13385331">Now, the same is true in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.147" offset="13399960">He is given the immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.575" offset="13405706">He is compelled to testify and then he walks out of the grand jury and a couple of weeks later, he encounters the defendant who is now indicted and the defendant apparently by whatever means persuades him to recant his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.925" offset="13475088">The recantation has totally destroyed the value of the immunity that this witness was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.954" offset="13499225">It's -- it's undone the usefulness of the statutory scheme that Congress created.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.278" offset="13520436">And I think it would be very unfortunate and certainly not what Congress would have wanted if in the future when situations like this arise, an indicted defendant can say to a witness who gave immunized testimony, "Well, you can recant it, don't worry, look at Dunn against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.569" offset="13581667">They can't use your grand jury testimony to show that you're lying the second time around."</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.897" offset="13606954">So in sum, we suggest that neither the Constitution nor the statute bars the use that we made of the immunize testimony in this case and accordingly the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3443.137" offset="13875911">It's a case in which -- it didn't deal with immunity statute that was subject to the construction that there was a statutory bar to a particular use and I think that was what I was trying to address in answering the Chief Justice's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.003" offset="13943411">On the constitutional point, Fried has very strong support for us because of course in Fried there was a statute that gave only contemporaneous and past offense immunity and not future offense immunity and the Court unanimously held both the Court's opinion and Justice Brennan emphasized that he could not complain that his statement might be used against him in connection with the future offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.062" offset="14043617">So that is we've relied heavily on our brief in that point but there is an agreement here that the Constitution may allow the Government to do but the statute doesn't allow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.696" offset="14082173">And it's to that argument that I was addressing the Chief Justice's question and I was saying that first of all there was no bargain with him that we wouldn't make the kind of use that we made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.097" offset="14127731">And secondly, I think the Chief Justice's right in suggesting that from a policy standpoint, he's robbed us of the -- of what we were entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.822" offset="14166706">Once he got that immunity, we were entitled to his truthful testimony and he's undone taken away the value of that by going out and giving sworn recantation of that testimony which destroyed the prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3585.427" offset="14445066">Your Honor, respondent's argument is preceded on the basis that if this Court rules that immunized testimony cannot be used in establishing the corpus delicti of an inconsistent declarations prosecution, that means anybody has a free license to commit perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.276" offset="14508492">That is not what we're contending in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.845" offset="14518732">We're merely contending that the Government is obliged once it offers immunity to prove that a man has perjured himself under testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.965" offset="14547257">That was not established in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.810" offset="14558647">To the contrary, the evidence in the record was that there was much to believe the truthfulness of Dunn's grand jury testimony under compulsion.</text>
