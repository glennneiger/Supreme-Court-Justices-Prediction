            <text syncTime="1.000" offset="107395">We'll hear arguments next in 1258, Minnesota against the First of Omaha and the consolidated case.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.902" offset="462973">Mr. Allyn, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_b_allyn" startTime="94.097" stopTime="507.790">
            <label>Mr. Richard B. Allyn</label>
            <text syncTime="94.097" offset="479796">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, counsel, I do speak on behalf for the interest of the State of Minnesota in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.709" offset="510203">This is an appeal for the Minnesota Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.738" offset="522324">The dispute is over whether a Nebraska National Bank has to abide by the Minnesota usury laws when it charges interest to Minnesota residents under bank credit card program conducted in Minnesota or whether is it claimed that it can impart the Nebraska usury law in to Minnesota in order to charge 6% more interest than the other banks are doing business in Minnesota including other national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.750" offset="630366">Now, BankAmericard and Master Charge credit card programs have been marketed in Minnesota if indeed throughout the country for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.176" offset="660041">It's a fair statement to say that thousands of Minnesotans rely on these cards daily to purchase goods and services and need to get cash advances.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.018" offset="699434">A few years ago, Minnesota passed a specific statute to govern these kinds of transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.756" offset="726392">It's known as the open end loan arrangement law we call it the Bank Credit Card Act but essentially it says this, that a state or national bank or savings bank can issue a credit to a consumer, permit them to pay it back in a flexible way, permit them use the money in a flexible way.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.208" offset="816253">And indeed, the cardholder himself decides when he's going to obtain the credit and when he's going to pay it off.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.487" offset="841331">In Minnesota, the statute says, the annual interest that may be charged is 12%.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.164" offset="860035">In addition, there are some compounding limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.386" offset="872887">Finally, there is a $15.00 fee permitted -- up to $15.00 permitted for the privilege in using the card.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.354" offset="900786">It's important to note that without exception the national banks and the state banks of Minnesota which have issued and used these cards have abided by the Minnesota law from its inception in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.387" offset="944880">Await 1975, the First National Bank of Omaha, Nebraska came to Minnesota registered a wholly-owned subsidiary which is managed by one of its vice presidents with our secretary state appointed a person suitable to see the process in Minnesota and embarked upon a systematic solicitation of Minnesota residents using the telephone and the mails.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.100" offset="1047803">In addition, merchants and banks willing to handle these transactions were enlisted.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.311" offset="1068596">Now, the problem is that the First National Bank of Omaha, Nebraska wants to charge 18% on the unpaid balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.097" offset="1099734">In addition, they have some compounding techniques if you call them at which exceed those, which are permitted by our state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.206" offset="1136201">The issue in this case then is whether or not they can do that or whether they have to abide by our statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.389" offset="1160965">And let me just say by way of introduction that it seems without dispute that a state's right to protect its citizens from usury has been a tradition in America since it's founding.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.687" offset="1206105">We have a long Minnesota on usury since Territorial Days and this tradition was in the mind of Congress we argue in 1864 when it passed the National Banking Act which is what you're examining here.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.234" offset="1264306">And that tradition was codified in this respect; a number of people wanted to adopt the uniform national interest rate but it was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.953" offset="1307146">It was felt that each state should be entitled to regulate interest each state could protect its own citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.462" offset="1333269">On the other hand, they wanted to make clear that their own creation the national banks or new creation that revised national banks, I should say, would not be unfairly treated by the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.532" offset="1381543">So they provided that in charging interest the national banks would be governed by the laws of the state where they're located.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.014" offset="1411427">There's no question that Congress intended for the states to continue to set the interest rate and that the national banks would be bound by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.687" offset="1446118">And just one quick quote and I won't try to belabor it but as the Congressman from California said, “What is the consistency or propriety of having two rates of interest established by law in the same community?”</text>
            <text syncTime="346.920" offset="1491048">What is the benefit of having two systems of usury in the same state?”</text>
            <text syncTime="350.407" offset="1505050">Of course they rejected that notion of two systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.401" offset="1516962">All right, what is now codified is Section 85 which is an issue here simply says, a national bank can charge for a loan what they can charge for loan is that rate allowed by the laws in a state where it's located.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.585" offset="1565759">First of Omaha claims our main office is in Omaha, Nebraska; we can charge the Nebraska rate and go anywhere in the country and charge that rate because we're located in Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.775" offset="1614451">Now, we urge that Congress never intended to let this provision be use to export interest rates into other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.717" offset="1650291">We believe that Congress intended to preserve to each state the right to regulate interest rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.223" offset="1672234">Now, there is no question that the language on its face raises the possibility they assert here.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.610" offset="1701804">We don't deny that.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.796" offset="1706506">Now, we urge you to consider Congress' purpose and intent when they adopted Section 85 and we have supplied in our brief statement such as similar to the one that I've read which indicates what that intent is.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.453" offset="1769200">It seems clear to us that at the time that Congress adopted Section 85, it only contemplated banks be in one place.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.657" offset="1817997">Banks didn't travel the -- they'd pass the interstate commerce the way they do today.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.554" offset="1841612">A person even from another state one at a loan, they showed up at the bank and posted their security or note and bundles of notes were handled across the counter in the way they went.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.352" offset="1888737">Now, a couple of courts, the decisions which are cited in our brief have agreed that Section 85 then is silent when a bank goes somewhere else than the state where it's located, that as a result when they go elsewhere are governed by whatever laws in the force in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.988" offset="1975359">I think there's an alternative argument that is just to sound and which I would urge here today as well and that is that located can mean more than just where the home office is or that building is.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.277" offset="2040456">If you look at the intention of Congress and you apply it to the transaction here, it seems to me that there's no question when a bank comes in to Minnesota, does a substantial solicitation, profits by its commerce in our state, maintains a corporation license to do business in Minnesota or a form corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.998" offset="2255391">And secondly, the subsidiary was the one that was going to collect delinquent accounts.</text>

            <text syncTime="598.372" offset="2496867">Well, it would have made a difference here and here is how it happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.338" offset="2508675">They claim that their card was free.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.447" offset="2517138">No other card in Minnesota had claimed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.239" offset="2524348">The reason they could claim their card was free is that they weren't charging this privilege fee and the reason they can do that is because they're charging a higher amount of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.510" offset="2557367">So, no one else could make this wonderful claim that their card is free and pity the consumer walking down the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.646" offset="2581922">All these banks said -- signs up said BankAmericard, many banks and facilities not an exclusive license.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.935" offset="2607104">And let's face it, one of the intents behind usury laws and idea is the public can't protect itself wholly.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.865" offset="2634794">It doesn't shop as wisely as it might.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.574" offset="2645661">So, we're saying the legislature is saying in the exercise of our police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.839" offset="2662693">We got look out for the citizens to a limited extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.600" offset="2673768">And that limited extent is set in outside limit on how much interest can be charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.650" offset="2693935">So, I agree that shopping around is certainly a part and parcel of our economy but some protections apparently have been added.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.515" offset="2737403">The important thing that we want to emphasize here today that we're speaking for the State of Minnesota is that we feel very strongly that if Section 85 interpreted in the way that they want it's going to displace our own ability to protect our citizens from usury.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.415" offset="2797066">And I think there are some analogous cases although they're not based on Section 85 but those cases the (Inaudible) cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.375" offset="2824861">There're three of them now out of the Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.158" offset="2831966">All of them holding that a mail or company in Chicago which ship things off to say a state like in Pennsylvania must not charge more interest than the law in Pennsylvania and it is not an undue burden on interstate commerce, and it's not an interference to their ability make a profit in that state.</text>

            <text syncTime="720.860" offset="2986820">To our knowledge, there are only two national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.113" offset="2995806">They are going elsewhere and claiming that they can take their higher rate with them and at least we did it one or two last points I want to make before giving way to other counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.129" offset="3031855">That is there is a request been made in one of the amicus that you make a perspective ruling here.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.565" offset="3053589">Firstly, the state does not object to that because we're just seeking an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.065" offset="3071666">But I'd like to point out that our evidence shows that first of all there aren't that many other banks that were doing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.850" offset="3102804">Almost every state in the country today has a bank credit card statute which sets an interest rate in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.956" offset="3127150">Secondly, First Omaha came into Minnesota and kept doing what they did in the face of our new statute without ever challenging, without ever bringing on a declaratory judgment, without ever even asking the Commissioner of Banking for an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.192" offset="3180126">So, what isn't is if they want a notice if there might be a problem that they decide the commerce in our state and take a profit from our state without abiding by our law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1046.708" offset="4290226">The -- I would like to respond to a couple of questions that were asked here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.294" offset="4308511">In terms of the competitive disadvantage which the market National Bank finds itself, it charges a 12% rate and a $15.00 membership fee or did until it so its program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.580" offset="4361697">The Omaha Bank comes in here at 18% rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.335" offset="4376743">What is the competitor disadvantage to the market bank as distinguished from disadvantage to the Minnesota consumer?</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.313" offset="4404642">The disadvantage to the market bank is number one, obviously it cannot charge an 18% rate, it cannot get the profit yield of an 18% rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.349" offset="4452812">But more precisely a bank which can charge a higher rate of interest has tremendous flexibility in advantage in terms of advertising in terms of soliciting the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.982" offset="4499310">If it is entitled to a greater yield, it can afford to spend the time, money and effort in order to track the consumers in the State of Minnesota and draw them off of for instance in Marquette's program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.351" offset="4548733">Furthermore, the Omaha Bank has a competitive advantage at the 18% rate level because the Omaha Bank in Omaha is entitled to charge its finance charge of one-half percent per month on the previous balance of the customer's account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.913" offset="4623026">Whereas in Minnesota, the rule provided by our statute is that must charge that rate on the average daily balance of the customer's account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.126" offset="4655835">Now, while charging a finance charge of say 1% on the average balance, the account is distinguished from the previous balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.438" offset="4697109">The yield is greater using the previous balance method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.022" offset="4707453">So that's just another example of how Omaha Bank and its subsidiary are privileged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.170" offset="4736084">Secondly, we are not as Mr. Allyn has suggested urging that you overrule Tiffany.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.955" offset="4763146">A Tiffany can be limited to its facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.910" offset="4775058">A Tiffany was a situation involving a Missouri Bank, it was intrastate transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.298" offset="4804524">The Missouri law provided for a 10% rate of interest to general lenders in the state; a state bank is limited 8%.</text>

            <text syncTime="1564.174" offset="6360064">Back to my point, if you look at the -- the Seventh Circuit here has taken the position of the plain language of the statute, it talks in the first clause of 12 U.S.C. 85 that's on page 23 of our brief, it talks about to the fact that the words are “any loan” and that means any loan made in the State of Nebraska, any loan made in the State of Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.594" offset="6465703">We don't believe that you can read the statute that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.418" offset="6517008">Given the second clause of 12 U.S.C. 85, that interpretation won't wash the interpretation here that Nebraska Bank can charge you the highest rate of interest provided in either state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.705" offset="6574164">The clause has taken as a whole, are clearly referring to any loans made in the state where the national bank is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.483" offset="6601331">You've got to construe both clauses together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.256" offset="6612407">If the words “any loan” in the first clause referred to loans made across state lines, then the second clause presumably would refer to the rate of interest permitted state bank located in the foreign state, rather than state banks located in the home state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.015" offset="6671444">It's clear that the second clause refers to the rate of interest permitted state banks located in the home state and the home state only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.879" offset="6714911">The construction given here by the Seventh Circuit by the State of Minnesota is Section 85, conflicts with the doctrine of the competitive equality which has been ever since Tiffany, that has been part and parcel in Section 85.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.280" offset="6768515">The purpose of Congress in adopting Section 85 was to maintain and secure the competitive equality between national banks and state banks and the interest rates they could charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.001" offset="6819401">If you look at the Senate debates in the Congressional Globe which we cite in our brief, it's clear that there is not any debate by the senators as to this point, as to what interest rates could be charged for a national bank across the state lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.556" offset="6905605">Certainly, they would have debated that point because you had a state bank lobby on one hand in 1864 and you had a national bank lobby on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.660" offset="6946043">And they were very concerned, each separate party, by protecting their interests and that if there was any thought of that time in adopting Section 85 that the national bank from Nebraska was going to be able to come into the state of Minnesota and charge Nebraska rates, the senators will raise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.002" offset="7015424">You would have seen that in the debates, you don't see that in the debates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.360" offset="7044786">Adoption of the Seventh Circuit -- decision adoption of the Minnesota position and the Minnesota Supreme Court's position means destruction here of the doctrine of competitive equality between state national banks and interest rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.952" offset="7103195">As Mr. Allyn pointed out, there is a very delegate balance between national banks and states banks in terms of the competition between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.886" offset="7166934">If you're going to allow a Nebraska Bank to come in here, to the State of Minnesota, and by offering the card free, draw off, and in effect to ruin Marquette's bank card program, what's to stop it from going to some other state and doing the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.988" offset="7251362">No local, national or state bank will be safe from the predatory practices then about the state national banks located in the state permitting high interest rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.694" offset="7302144">Again, I emphasize, that Marquette in the State of Minnesota take the position that Section 85 of National Bank Act is simply silent on the issue what interest rates may be charged by a national bank when it crosses state lines and transacts business in the foreign state.</text>

            <text syncTime="1824.959" offset="7403186">We take the position that since Section 85 is silent that ordinary conflicts or conflict of law rules apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.949" offset="7451146">For instance, in the First Clause of Section 85, when you read the words -- the laws, any national bank association may charge on a loan or discount made interest, the rate allowed by the laws of the state that means the state's conflicts of law rules as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="2047.054" offset="8291558">The only substantive question in this case is actually whether Section 85 of the National Bank Act applies to interstate loan transactions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2091.815" offset="8470653">I think it is more accurate to say that Minnesota is exporting its law to a Nebraska bank.</text>

            <text syncTime="3380.359" offset="13624822">I think there's no difference whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.771" offset="13630464">The Minnesota statute, I am told by counsel, makes one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.211" offset="13648227">But I really -- my argument really is the Section 85 governs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.337" offset="13660766">I have already made the point I think that its plain language governs any text.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.161" offset="13684067">Now, the question is there are only two arguments made against that, and each of them is completely auspicious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.808" offset="13706637">The first one is that there is a policy of competitive equality which has to be read into Section 85, auspicious because that policy derives from later enactments which have nothing to do with Section 85.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.045" offset="13767555">And if you'll look at the Marquette Bank's brief, Marquette Bank itself on page 13 as I recall agrees that a state bank -- pardon me, a national bank in a state gets the rate that the general lender gets or the rate that the state bank gets, whichever is higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.998" offset="13839339">That's not a policy of equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.928" offset="13847071">That on the face of the statute is a policy of favored lender.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.544" offset="13865566">Now, that is exactly what Tiffany held, and Tiffany was right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.033" offset="13883538">Now it said -- but since then, we had a policy of competitive equality, which somehow it would be read backwards, to overcome the language as 85.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.223" offset="13916244">In fact, that is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.617" offset="13921886">If you will look at Section 85, you will see that in 1933, it was amended to give national banks but not state banks freedom from state regulation by giving national banks the option of charging 1% above the federal discount rate, which option was not extended to state banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.928" offset="14015091">And what that means is at the beginning, competitive equality as to discount, as to interest rates was never intended by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.016" offset="14047483">Competitive equality as to interest rates is not intended by Congress today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.822" offset="14070680">And I think I've sufficiently pointed out that there is no competitive inequality in fact in this case because it's a dispute over advertising techniques.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.252" offset="14104430">They have a technique they could use, as well as the one that we have used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.936" offset="14123133">The other argument is that Congress simply could not have intended Section 85 to apply to an interstate transaction because there was no interstate lending back in those days or nothing to speak of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.195" offset="14176110">That assertion is incredible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.128" offset="14187917">Before this -- before the American Revolution, there was inter-colonial lending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.038" offset="14215502">In their book, the Stamp Act Crisis, Helen and Edmund Morgan point out that the Stamp Act Crisis cause the closing of the colonial courts and that states are colonies rather such as Connecticut were delighted because that meant out of colony creditors couldn't enforce their judgments in Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.101" offset="14287809">Before the American Revolution, there was an international trading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.686" offset="14302124">London factories financed our tobacco trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.945" offset="14315186">George Washington himself was engaged in that kind of financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.278" offset="14336502">When we come to the Constitution itself, it's clear that interstate lending follows interstate commerce, builds an exchange and so forth, which I mentioned specifically in Section 85.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.906" offset="14379029">And one of the reasons for holding a Constitutional Convention was to deal with control of the federal level over interstate commerce and it is quite clear I think that in the writing of a Constitution, the framers were contemplating interstate lending because they took care to make it a federal power to write a uniform bankruptcy law obviously to prevent discrimination against out of state creditors by -- by states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.008" offset="14487385">Now, if we come to the period after the revolution, I refer simply to the brief file by the First National Bank of Chicago, which gives examples of bank interstate lending in the 1830's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.122" offset="14543809">I would refer you, the Court, also to Carl Swisher's history of this Court in the Taney years, the homes device history of this Court in which he points out that in 1839, this Court was deciding the right of corporations to deal in -- bills of exchange in states other than where they were incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.676" offset="14610056">And he points out that President Van Buren had to address Congress in the special session about the problem posed by bills of exchange, who transferred capital from one region of the country to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.471" offset="14653210">If that Congress didn't understand that interstate lending was going on all around it, it must have been incredibly obtuse or else, it was hermetically sealed, and it was neither.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.550" offset="14693543">And once we assume that Congress understood that interstate lending existed around it in 1864, then we cannot assume that Congress for the only time in history reversed the Constitutional pattern and chose to legislate entirely as to intrastate transactions and leave to the states the control of interstate transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.565" offset="14777657">That turns the thing entirely upside down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.719" offset="14790196">So I think there is no -- I would close with a remark that this industry could be thrown into chaos if we have now -- not just the credit card industry, the entire industry -- if we have now to take the 48 billion credit card holders out there, follow their residences as they move around the country, recompute interests, recalculate the way it's done, follow the laws of all the jurisdictions, I don't know whether this kind of business or the interstate mortgage business or the automobile loan business is going to be doable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.143" offset="14919973">There are enormous costs involved that simply aren't in this record that ought to be taken into account by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.703" offset="14946200">Congress has amended this Section 85 many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.378" offset="14960933">Congress has taken up the credit card issue in terms of how you compute these rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.829" offset="14982666">In 1977, a bill was introduced on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.334" offset="14996668">It is not as if Congress was inactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.178" offset="15016103">And we have a trillion-dollar -- many trillion-dollar interstate loan businesses which simply ought not to be thrown into confusion by overturning a law that has been so clear and been regarded so clear and have been interpreted so consistently for over a hundred years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.480" offset="15105337">And for that reason, because of the law, because of Tiffany, because of the understanding, because of the financial industry that has been built around it, we ask the judgment of the Supreme Court of Minnesota be affirmed.</text>
