            <text syncTime="50.140" offset="303940">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.446" offset="305194">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.264" offset="316479">It has been six months since this Court first heard oral argument in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.935" offset="335078">And for that reason, with the Court's permission, I will take a minute or two to offer a brief summary of the facts relevant to the issue again before this Court, namely, whether a private right of action may be implied under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.444" offset="401115">This Court learned last March this case came to Court in April 1973 with a suit by the plaintiff and respondent Harry Lewis asking legal and equitable relief for alleged violation of the Investment Advisers Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.163" offset="460048">The petitioners moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim and argued that Mortgage Trust of America was and is a mortgage lender which does not deal in securities within the meaning of the federal securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.315" offset="512606">That Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, its -- its adviser is not a public investment adviser in any sense of that word.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.595" offset="541759">That the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 does not apply to the petitioners or to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.506" offset="565373">That the respondent Lewis had failed to make proper demand on the trustees of Mortgage Trust of America and that the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 does not afford a private right of action in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.575" offset="613648">The District Court noted that the petitioners' arguments had what were called "substantial merit" but ruled that since the Advisers Act does not afford a private right of action that the other questions would not be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.601" offset="657742">On appeal, petitioners again argued that the Investment Advisers Act does not apply to the petitioners or to the facts of this case and that there is no private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.594" offset="701733">The Court of Appeals also declined to consider the other arguments just mentioned and ruled, with one judge dissenting, "Implication of a private right of action for injunctive relief and damages under the Advisers Act in favor of appropriate plaintiffs is necessary to achieve the goals of Congress in enacting legislation."</text>
            <text syncTime="170.505" offset="785429">The decision and the dissent of the Court of Appeals is based on and indeed simply incorporates the decision of the Second Circuit and the dissent in the Second Circuit in a case known as Abrahamson versus Fleschner.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.482" offset="849272">As we had occasioned to state last March, this case presents a narrow technical question of law and a broad important question of judicial policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.815" offset="890650">The narrow question of law presented is whether a private right of action may be implied under Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.744" offset="930356">The question of judicial policy presented is whether this Court should imply a right of action under the Advisers Act and then leave to further litigation resolution of such questions as who may bring the action, who may be named a defendant, allocations of burdens of proof, the evidentiary standards to be applied, and the damages which may be recovered.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="229.225" stopTime="239.725">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="229.225" offset="1020322">Are you suggesting that if Congress did not either expressly or imply -- impliedly create a cause of action, this Court could do so?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_anderson" startTime="239.725" stopTime="306.285">
            <label>Mr. John M. Anderson</label>
            <text syncTime="239.725" offset="1062222">It's my belief Mr. Justice Rehnquist that -- that Congress has had an opportunity on numerous occasions both when the Act was originally passed and since that time to consider and to act on whether or not a private right of action is appropriate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.258" offset="1116453">And as we point out in our brief, on each occasion it has not created, expressly not created and imply -- excuse me -- a cause of action and for that reason, we take the position that this Court is not in a position to -- to make that judgment, if you will, that there ought to be a private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.353" offset="1184789">I might -- in further answer to that question, refer back to the language of the Court of Appeals in this case where the Court of Appeals said that it made the judgment that it was necessary to have this implied right of action in order to carry out the purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.024" offset="1243512">And I question it, with all due respect, whether this Court is in a position to substitute its judgment or the Court of Appeals was in a position to substitute its judgment for what seems to be the judgment of the Congress on six different occasions since 1940 that there should not be an expressed or a right of private action under the Investment Advisers Act.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="306.285" stopTime="315.302">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="306.285" offset="1328462">Didn't Professor Loss in his testimony suggest that Congress should do just that, just leave the matter open and let -- let the courts decide it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_anderson" startTime="315.302" stopTime="600.900">
            <label>Mr. John M. Anderson</label>
            <text syncTime="315.302" offset="1364616">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.952" offset="1367228">Professor Loss suggested in his testimony to the -- to the committee hearing of legislation that was proposed, I believe in 1966 that it might facilitate, I think those were his words, implication of a private right of action if this Court -- if the Congress at that time were to add the words "action at law" to the jurisdiction and venue provision of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.435" offset="1453119">But I think that the suggestion that facilitation would take place is a telling -- admission that it does not exist otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.497" offset="1489377">Now, for this Court to imply a private right of action under the Investment Advisers Act, it would necessarily engender uncertainty as well as cause delay and undoubtedly add to the expense of the parties involved and in general frustrate the very rights which is suggested here should be implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.051" offset="1571610">And I say that because to imply a private right of action must necessarily in the context of this case leave open all of those questions which Congress very well could spell out, could delineate, could define as it did when it created a private right of action under the Investment Company Act in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.658" offset="1658023">This engendering of uncertainty comes against a background of statutory language which is unique to the Investment Adviser Act and which confers jurisdiction on the federal courts for only one legal purpose, the jurisdictional provision of the Investment Advisers Act limits the jurisdiction to a suit in equity to enjoin violations of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.367" offset="1760841">That language is unique to the Investment Advisers Act and it is distinguishable from each of the other federal securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.056" offset="1791561">The other laws -- the other Acts all provide that the jurisdiction shall extend to all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created under each of those Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.377" offset="1852897">The addition of -- or the omission of the language action at law brought to enforce any duty or liability, we are told in the case of Touche Ross versus Redington ought not to be read as the creation of a private right of action but we contend that it remains an important indication of congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.521" offset="1941504">Now the respondent's only explanation for the difference in the language between the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the other federal securities laws, to which I have just referred, is that there was either an unintentional oversight by an unidentified draftsman and that the section itself really has no legislative history worthy of the name.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.941" offset="2035127">Now, the importance of the Advisers Act's special language is reinforced by an examination of that Act's legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.497" offset="2065324">Now, a physical anthropologist, the counsel in this case have sifted through the legislative history, the stand -- the sands and the pebbles, if you will, of legislative history, and they have found artifacts to support their position in each direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.166" offset="2124048">But the important part of that -- of that search or to -- to take the metaphor one step further, that dig is that -- that the proponents of an affirmative private right of actions for damages in this case or for equitable relief have been unable to point to any one solid evidence or one solid piece of testimony or anything that would approach solid indication that Congress intended that the Act serve as a spring-board for private actions by disgruntled investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.076" offset="2247659">But there is one other artifact on the other side that we believe to be particularly important, and that is the amendment to the Investment Company Act in 1970 in which the Congress expressly created a private right of action under the Investment Company Act, the companion statute to the Investment Advisers Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.234" offset="2328325">The 1970 amendment to the Investment Company Act added a private right of action to the Investment Company Act, but no private right of action to the Advisers Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.330" offset="2368658">This addition of a private right of action to the Investment Company Act included congressional attention to each of those unknown factors to which I referred earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.464" offset="2413275">When Congress acted in 1970, it defined the duty or the standard of conduct, it defined the class of plaintiffs, parties who could sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.265" offset="2452459">It defined the class of defendants who could be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.528" offset="2465520">It allocated the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.967" offset="2475238">It established the evidentiary standards that must be met by the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.937" offset="2491120">And it proscribed the damages which could be recoverable.</text>

            <text syncTime="600.900" offset="2507003">Hasn't -- haven't some of the decisions of this Court said that what Congress did or didn't do 25 or 30 years after the Act on which the parties relying isn't of great significance?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. John M. Anderson</label>
            <text syncTime="614.260" offset="2560397">That's correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist however, as recently as -- as June, I believe it was, in the case of Touche Ross versus Redington, this Court ruled that -- and instructed, if you will, counsel to look to the context in which a statute was enacted or to look to the context in which it appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.640" offset="2625912">The exact words are the -- to call attention to the statutory scheme of which the statute was a part.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="636.374" stopTime="639.006">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="636.374" offset="2648900">But that would be the 1940 Act here, wouldn't it?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. John M. Anderson</label>
            <text syncTime="639.006" offset="2659349">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.329" offset="2660707">And in 1940, of course, there was no private right of action created under the Investment Company Act either.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.374" offset="2680874">But I think it significant that in 1970, in the course of amending both the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act that the Congress expressly created a private right of action against certain investment advisers under the Investment Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.331" offset="2740746">And it seems to me that that's a -- if Congress had intended that there be or wanted there to be, if you will, a private right of action under the Investment Advisers Act, that would have been the time to do it.</text>

            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="671.325" offset="2788707">Couldn't Congress have assumed that?</text>

            <text syncTime="676.321" offset="2808665">It's possible, Mr. -- yes, Mr. Justice Marshall, it is possible that Congress could have assumed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.351" offset="2828727">However, for Congress to have assumed that, one would have supposed that we could find in the record some indication or existence of that assumption and there is none.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.503" offset="2861432">There is no -- nothing in the record to suggest, nothing in the congressional hearing to suggest that Congress assumed that that right existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.780" offset="2886510">And I would further add that if Congress assumed that the right existed, why did it deem it necessary to create the Act, the private right of action into the Investment Company Act, in which a companion statute in which it could've just as easily have deemed that it existed and therefore was unnecessary in that instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.484" offset="2961324">It -- to take it one step further, the actions of Congress in 1970 really alleviate the major policy objections that we see to the implication of a private right in this instance because as I point out, it does really address all of these very difficult questions having to do with standing damages, burdens of proof, and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="832.072" offset="3431633">And if I may add to that, the difficulty which we pointed out to the Court last March in which -- that will of course persist today is that the respondents in this case have asked for rescission and incidental damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.953" offset="3487222">So if for example this Court were to make a distinction between legal and equitable relief and to limit it, the relief to equitable relief, I think that the distinction would soon become the -- become meaningless for the reason that courts of equity have traditionally been empowered to grant complete relief including incidental damages as necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.182" offset="3572067">Now there is additional legislative history which clearly points away in our judgment from the implication of a private remedy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.103" offset="3599757">But rather than repeat and summarize that history all of which appears in the briefs, I respectfully refer simply to the fact again that neither the respondent nor the SEC have been able to offer any direct evidence that Congress intended to give clients of investment advisers ready access to the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.449" offset="3677184">At best the respondents and the SEC simply urge an analogy to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a different Act for a different purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.309" offset="3724622">Let me turn now, if it please the Court, to two principal policy objections to the implication of a private right of action under the Advisers Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.493" offset="3757328">First, if this Court were to imply a private right of action under the Advisers Act, it would undermine, if not destroy, this Court's recognition in 1975 that an investor cannot maintain an action under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 unless the investor can allege the purchase or sale of a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.780" offset="3842487">Now, according to the respondents and the SEC, merely being a client of an investment adviser, the existence of the relationship endows that client or prospective client with the right to sue for damages or to seek equitable relief even though the client or prospective client neither purchased nor sold a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.464" offset="3925243">Let me pose an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.414" offset="3933080">Let us suppose that an investment adviser recommended against the purchase of a certain common stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.877" offset="3962859">Let us further suppose that the client follows the advice of the adviser and does not purchase the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.009" offset="3983444">Let us suppose that the stock next rises in value.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.499" offset="3997341">According to the SEC and the respondent, the existence of the relationship between the adviser and the client would give that client the right to file a suit against the adviser and allege that but for the advice he would have purchased the common stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.916" offset="4055019">Now, the SEC clearly says at pages 40 to 45 -- excuse me -- 41 through 45 of its initial brief, that since the Investment Advisers Act does not have purchase or sale language, we don't need to worry about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.473" offset="4113220">It is not a requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.545" offset="4121579">The respondent seems to say the same thing at pages 60 to 62 of its -- of the respondent's brief, although it is less direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.790" offset="4154493">The conclusion is that a client who does not purchase stock would be entitled to maintain an action under Section 206 of the Advisers Act, whereas someone who did not have an investment adviser, and was not dealing with an investment adviser, would be barred from bringing a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.978" offset="4215306">The result is that -- in effect, a discrimination between those who are fortunate enough to afford the services of an investment adviser and those who do not use an investment adviser.</text>

            <text syncTime="1042.310" offset="4272567">But the point -- the point is, I think, Mr. Stevens -- Mr. Justice Stevens is that if the allegation were that they were the victim of fraud with respect to not purchasing, they would have standing under the rationale of the interpretation given that -- given by the respondent SEC -- by the respondent and the SEC in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.667" offset="4349994">I think the example well illustrates the extent to which implying a private right of action in this case would undermine the limitation, if you will, that this Court recognized in the Manor-Blue Chip Stamp Case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1138.796" offset="4658552">I -- I must say that I think with one possible exception that Touche Ross and Redington seem to be conceptually identical to the case which is before the Court and that the rationale for that case would suggest a decision in the petitioner's favor here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.726" offset="4714245">The case of -- of Cannon is not inconsistent with a ruling here for the rather, I think, abundant reasons given in that case, such as the existence of -- a provision for attorney's fees to the prevailing party other than the Government, the existence of congressional action following implication of a private right of action and for all other reasons given in the majority opinion in that case that the Cannon case is absolutely consistent with a ruling in the petitioner's favor here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1191.985" offset="4871293">And that centers on the special wording of Section 206, the provision of the Investment Advisers Act on which the claim for private right or private relief is based.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.265" offset="4912462">Section 206 makes it unlawful for an investment adviser to defraud a client or prospective client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.980" offset="4939316">The keywords are of course "a prospective client."</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.249" offset="4952377">And this raises an interesting example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.060" offset="4959587">Let us suppose that an investment adviser were to send a business solicitation -- a letter or material to a prospective client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.792" offset="4990516">Let us suppose next that that material were later deemed or alleged by the SEC to be misleading, fraudulent, deceptive, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.722" offset="5026252">The SEC clearly says at pages 40 -- 41 through 45 of its brief that this prospective client would have a claim under the Investment Advisers Act and the respondent is simply silent on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.201" offset="5076198">Those who are respect -- prospective clients of investment advisers are hardly a discreet class of plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.713" offset="5102216">But more importantly the -- the notion that a private right of action could exist in favor of prospective clients at a minimum raises more questions than it could possibly answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.687" offset="5146102">Nonetheless, Section 206 speaks of right -- speaks of prospective clients as well as clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.395" offset="5172955">Prospective clients, however, is consistent with enforcement by the SEC, going into court and seeking to prevent an investment adviser from sending misleading or deceptive material with respect to investments.</text>

            <text syncTime="1569.965" offset="6383261">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.916" offset="6407084">We too think it is appropriate to begin this reargument by calling attention to what this case is and what therefore is actually and necessarily before this Court for decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.640" offset="6469883">This is an action brought derivatively by a shareholder of a real estate investment trust against its investment adviser, certain of the trustees of the trust, the parent of the adviser and a sister corporation alleged to have been a party to the transactions alleged to be fraudulent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.993" offset="6559326">Now, in discussing the issues before the Court, we are again dividing time with the Government, the SEC, and subject to the Court's desires and questions, we intend to focus on the case, what the statute does by necessity, by implication, and the legislative background against which the statute was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.511" offset="6661413">The Commission will emphasize again subject to the Court's questions, the appropriateness within the enforcement picture of a private remedy, the question of the relationship between the administrative machinery and the appropriateness of implications of private remedy, and the inapplicability of doctrines such as those arising from Amtrak and SIPC against Barbour.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.571" offset="6781680">Again with the Court's permission, I'd like to point out that this case is as I argued last spring, in its principal cause of action, classically equitable in the substantive form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.377" offset="6828910">Now, there's no quibble that merger happened and that merger started out as a procedural doctrine, has continued to be a procedural doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.272" offset="6856495">I think there is also no quibble that the substantive law recognizes in the nature of relief available and the nature of defenses available, there is still such a thing as a claim equitable in its character, in its substantive character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.573" offset="6905710">Although one is not demurrable, if one pleads the inequity in a thing called a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.414" offset="6925040">We can't plead laches in a complaint for goods sold and delivered and you can plead laches in a bill for restitution and rescission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.840" offset="6954715">And its primary cause of action, this is a bill for rescission of a contract alleged to be the product of a fraudulent scheme and plan for restitution of the compensation or at least the excess compensation paid thereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.198" offset="7004139">Even contains the partial seeds of a partial equitable defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.827" offset="7018663">That is that the full restitution of all compensation would be something for a court sitting -- as a court of equity to consider if all of the services rendered could not be tendered back for what they were worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.449" offset="7065161">So what is actually before this Court and what can't -- be not decided, given that certiorari has been granted, is whether an equitable action arises by necessary implication or proper implication through Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.363" offset="7140812">Now, Cannon against the University of Chicago, I think, teaches us that the Cort against Ash analysis wholly appropriate to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.921" offset="7179055">But as we were so bold as to suggest in our first brief, the four criteria are not independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.033" offset="7199535">They are not four points to count on a scoreboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.697" offset="7210193">The second through fourth illuminate the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.924" offset="7227120">And while there has been a difference in the expression of analysis, this really doesn't differ from what the courts did a 100 years ago, at least as I understand it, through our distinguished Dean Thayer, who said the reason we look to imply claims from wrong arising under statutes is because in an appropriate kind of case, and he was talking about the kind of case where standard of safety or a standard of decency had been established by a legislature, not to do so would be to fail to offer appropriate respect to the other branch of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.859" offset="7350836">There was no discontinuity between the cases at common law, the cases under early federal statutes, and the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.210" offset="7380198">There was a difference in approach and analysis, perhaps a tighter and more careful view of greater recognition when it arises of the problems of federalism.</text>

            <text syncTime="1845.583" offset="7485733">That is -- that in some cases, and perhaps increasingly the Congress is willing to take the risk of spelling out all of the elements of a special kind of cause of action that it wants to create.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.097" offset="7527737">But at least in 1940, and I think I only have to speak principally to 1940 and not to 1979, this was not a code country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.139" offset="7563891">There were experiments with codes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.377" offset="7572877">But as we've argued before, we think it perfectly clear that Congress created under some of the Securities Acts specific hybrid forms of action for specific wrongs, its study of which had given rise to the 1933 and 1934 and 1935 Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.682" offset="7638079">It likewise created certain open-ended provisions saying again and again in its legislative history we don't know, for example, what kind of fraud is going to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.113" offset="7671829">Professor Loss, in one of the treatise sections we cite in our original brief, picks up I think the appropriate metaphor for an Oregon state court that if we codify the law of fraud, the that Oregon court said, there is a certain kind of gentleman that would sit up overnights finding ways to commit three but not the fourth element of such fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.590" offset="7741733">A certain amount of open-endedness and non-codification of the law of fraud was recognized by the legislation to be necessary to avoid codifying the avoidance of any penalty for fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="1992.479" offset="8073279">I don't think it's a problem here because there is a much stronger indication of congressional intention that some private litigation arise from the Advisers Act -- directly in the Advisers Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.902" offset="8114970">There is a section, Section 215 (b) which says that any contract, any practice, the continuation of any relationship that's in violation of a substantive provision of this Title is void.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.732" offset="8170350">The courts, as this Court has recognized in Deckert, in citing Deckert and Blue Chip and other cases, softened the blow of the word "void" so that it doesn't mean no title may pass and a remote error of the grantor can't take the land back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.646" offset="8225938">But it's perfectly clear that the decisions of this Court that the least it means is avoidable at the suit of the party deceived or aggrieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.327" offset="8256658">Now that's right in the Advisers Act and if one is looking to decide as this Court so often traditionally has done, only the case before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.350" offset="8296782">We respectfully submit that this Court would have to nullify Section 215 (b) to say that no private litigation arises out of the anti-fraud provisions of the Advisers Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.203" offset="8340146">This is a much clearer case, we respectfully submit, without other considerations we haven't dealt with yet than Cannon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.958" offset="8379225">In Cannon, there's a prohibition against any person being discriminated against on several different bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.382" offset="8416946">This Court was wise enough to realize that a class of persons discriminated against even though large was a discreet class and it was right creating language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.967" offset="8455189">Here, we -- it is said in 206, no investment adviser shall defraud his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.827" offset="8478699">That's a very narrow discreet class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.835" offset="8486745">The legislative history from 1934 to 1940 is replete with indication that the Congress considered those who provide capital for the capital market to be a discreet class in need of special and new protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.764" offset="8538467">By the Court in Cannon standards, 206 is far narrower than 901, directed not only to a single kind of plaintiff but to a single kind of defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.094" offset="8575770">In 1940 it was only registered advisers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.616" offset="8585801">In 1960 it became any adviser.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.265" offset="8596459">As to the prospective client question, I think the answer is simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.728" offset="8614327">Fraud doesn't ripen into a cause of action until at least money passes, until the property is fraudulently taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.571" offset="8641703">A prospective client could easily cover the case where the fraud was in the inducement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.268" offset="8660407">As one of the things Congress was worried about touts and tipsters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.717" offset="8674200">The investor sends in his money, gets nothing back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.657" offset="8682036">The Court might say, "Well, this isn't an advisor-client relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.551" offset="8693530">It's a payment by fraud in the inducement or false pretenses."</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.297" offset="8712547">Otherwise, while the petitioners raise the horror of suits by people who get tip sheets and don't do anything, again this is a fraud statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2251.951" offset="9111176">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think this Court and most other federal courts would deal with the -- we took the (Inaudible) the same way this Court dealt with the problem presented in -- in Blue Chip.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.432" offset="9165093">The claim that nothing happened because somebody read something again is not traditional fraud or deceit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.894" offset="9194977">And I think this Court would deal with it as it said in that case that there is a level at which the Court must consider policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.858" offset="9218800">And again you can always say, "We will do nothing that a rational legislator would not have done."</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.172" offset="9236041">There is that mode of analysis too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.849" offset="9242728">We can say it cannot be that the Congress would've meant for this to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.566" offset="9257671">And within the rubric and within the proprieties, the courts would dispose of the fellow who said, "Well, I did nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2299.838" offset="9302706">I think -- again, 215 can be read as solving this case and this case only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.078" offset="9323708">This Court need not decide any other case at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.358" offset="9336769">This is not to say that we do not agree with the Government and with this Court in Touche Ross to make this perhaps somewhat agonizing distinction once you look at what 206 does on the basis of 214 and the omission of the phrase "actions at law".</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.154" offset="9403956">Probably is in keeping with the way jurisprudence has proceeded since merger and that once equitable jurisdiction attaches to make the argument that the question of which of a series of alternate remedies have been recognized as alternate for at least a generation rises to statutory or higher significance is a little bit like trying to write the Declaration of Independence on the head of a pin without a very small needle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.936" offset="9503117">We showed in our brief that 214 had no history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.014" offset="9515447">We showed that it wasn't looked at.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.382" offset="9520880">Wasn't it's written up, wasn't marked up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.198" offset="9528195">We showed one thing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.229" offset="9532270">We showed that if how it got passed meant anything, it means exactly the opposite of what the petitioner argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.724" offset="9550242">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.521" offset="9553481">Because the reports that came to the floor on which the majority voted said these contain the usual provisions about jurisdiction venue actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.748" offset="9590366">If that meant anything to the 266 votes and that was necessary to carry the House, it had to mean we're doing again what we did in 1933, what we did in 1934, what we did in 1935, the Holding Company Act, what we did in 1939, the Trust Indenture Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.616" offset="9649821">Nobody suggested to the Senate or the House there was any difference in the procedural sections of the Acts they enacted in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.018" offset="9691408">This Court has said more than I think it fit for me to comment on, on what we do with things that didn't get through Congress but weren't rejected by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.673" offset="9726098">So I'm not going to spend a lot of time on why Congress didn't amend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.443" offset="9741145">Again, we cover that with considerable thoroughness in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.645" offset="9753997">The investment -- the amendment of the Investment Company Act was a response to a particular scandal and a particular lengthy investigation by the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania on mutual fund fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.469" offset="9797256">And that's all that the Congress focused on and what -- one of the things they were worried about was a split of decision in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.967" offset="9819199">I think a difficult decision in the Second Circuit where the Court to do there what it thought had to be done and what Congress would have wanted it to do, had to go back and say, “Well, we'll raise a private claim for economic mishandling under the larceny statute”, which is probably as far as Judge Friendly has ever gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.965" offset="9887222">And perhaps Congress felt we better nail this down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.822" offset="9894640">They're having trouble in the First Circuit in most of the suit -- but the defendants seemed to have conceded it, having trouble in the Second, let's lay it out, and so they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.513" offset="9921390">There was no discussion in the Wharton Report of general problems of other kinds of investment advisers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.252" offset="9944377">Things that don't come to Congress' attention this Court has said for a hundred years aren't part of the history we can interpret.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.531" offset="10005504">The question has been raised and we don't think it's a proper kind of statutory interpretation, will something horrible happen if we read Section 206, Section 215 to create a private claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.082" offset="10055659">Again, the respondent notes that the petitioner has found 15 cases in a dozen years and that the judicial report tells us that 130,000 federal civil actions were filed last year de minimis non curat lex, there is no burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.321" offset="10132668">As to the elements of a cause of action this Court has now spoken as to what the proper elements of an action for fraud are and what they aren't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.558" offset="10169553">I can't warrant that all lower courts will understand but I would be terribly, terribly surprised if I could bring a negligence case against an Investment Adviser, I really would.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.477" offset="10205288">Or against as investment adviser who had never entered into a contract and never had a client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.195" offset="10224201">I really think that this is more or less asking this Court to not be a Court but to be a third house to say, “Well, no, this is the kind of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.164" offset="10251995">We've always done this with before.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.016" offset="10263385">Congress had to mean that a fellow could sue and set aside this contract and get his money back but either might -- just be so many suits even though it never happened before, we'd better stop it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.363" offset="10300792">I respectfully submit that is not what this Court has been doing in judicial administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.686" offset="10314167">It has not said that we are not going to enforce federal statutes because it's a problem to enforce federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.702" offset="10342170">As I said last spring, once Congress creates positive law, which I was taught in school means the command creating rights and duties, that the designing of remedies is the authority of the Courts in this country, in England, and the federal courts as much as the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.726" offset="10406327">One recognizes that the courts should not encroach on the province of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.602" offset="10425762">But Congress, we submit, expected the courts, certainly in 1940 and right on perhaps until early this summer, with a common anti-fraud statute to do what it had done with other common anti-fraud statutes directed toward classes that -- that Congress had indicated needed special protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="2625.564" offset="10605589">As the commission correctly states, if this Court is serving notice on Congress from now on, except for certain excepted areas, and the Court isn't in Cannon, serving that kind of notice, we will never imply a remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2780.693" offset="11226154">The Securities and Exchange Commission would like to talk about the five cases this Court decided last term that bear on this case, Cannon, Touche, Kidwell, Burks against Lasker, Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.311" offset="11268577">But before I do that, I have listened to Mr. Anderson on two occasions twist this case and I'd like to respond to a few of the things that he said before launching it to my argument in chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.498" offset="11305357">First, somehow Mr. Anderson seems to think that the Touche Ross opinion decided last term clothes Section 214 with some kind of special significance for his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.606" offset="11345795">If Touche Ross stands for anything, it stands for the fact that jurisdictional provisions like Section 214 create no duties, create no liabilities and if there are duties and liabilities to be created or to be recognized, you've got to go to the substantive provisions of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.892" offset="11398980">That's the anti-fraud provision, Section 206 here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.674" offset="11410056">I think it's inexplicable that he thinks that Touche Ross helps his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.106" offset="11423848">Secondly, he on three occasions to the course of his principal argument says that there is no indication of the legislative history that Congress affirmatively intended to create a private cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.035" offset="11467525">That's not the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.206" offset="11472227">Cannon and Touche affirm that that's not the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.404" offset="11481004">Mr. Justice Stevens in the course of the -- writing the majority opinion in Cannon said that that case was atypical, that's the word he used, "atypical", and that there seemed to be a rather significant indication of legislative intent to create a private cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.351" offset="11540773">And Mr. Justice White, in his dissenting opinion, disagreed with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2987.683" offset="12054131">Well, this Court has said in Cannon and Touche that once you've answered that threshold question from the language of the statute itself, then this Court is going to be decidedly receptive to implying a cause of action when it is necessary or at least helpful to effectuating the underlying congressional purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.703" offset="12114213">That, I think, this Court said in both of those cases as the next step.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.580" offset="12129677">And we think that this case needs that next step also.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.798" offset="12142529">Beyond that, the Court has said, if you want to regard it as a sub-step of 2, the Court has said that it's going to be decidedly receptive to implying a right of action if failing to do so would undermine the statutory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.504" offset="12193416">We think we meet that test too.Beyond that, the Court said as a third test, if you will, that it was going to be decidedly receptive to implying a private right of action when an explicit right is created on behalf of a benefitted class, but there is not an opportunity for that benefitted class to access, to intervene, to activate, to participate in the administrative machinery created under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.446" offset="12281187">We meet that test too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.551" offset="12289546">That I think is the -- is the refocusing, the refurbishing of Cort against Ash that -- that Cannon and Touche provide and I introduced the -- the subject of the Davis case also in my opening remark.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.699" offset="12334164">We think that that bears on this too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.438" offset="12341164">Because as Mr. Justice Brennan pointed out in that case, writing for the majority, the question of whether or not there's a cause of action under a statute is analytically distinct from the question of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.747" offset="12382333">So all of that Cannon-Touche language, all of the -- the new mode of analysis to determine whether or not Congress intended a right of action should be implied all focuses on the question of cause of action, as quite properly it should.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.990" offset="12443355">Well, continuing, Mr. -- Mr. Anderson also seems to think that or take some great comfort in the 1970 amendments to the Investment Company Act, creating an expressed right of action under Section 36 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.149" offset="12491943">But he omits to tell the Court that Congress said in both the Senate and House Reports, as I recall it, to those 1970 amendments to the Investment Company Act that it had absolutely no intention to adversely affect implied remedies under other provisions of the federal securities laws, particularly the Investment Company Act or I think the Investment Advisers Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.983" offset="12567280">He raises the 1976 amendments to the -- or proposed amendments to the Investment Advisers Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.294" offset="12588596">But he doesn't tell you there that Congress considered those 1976 amendments merely to confirm what it understood to be the fact that actions have been implied and properly so under Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.688" offset="12646170">Mr. Anderson says that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the respondents in this case seek -- seek to imply a private right of action merely by some analogy to the Securities and Exchange Act, an obvious reference to Borak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.327" offset="12700714">Well, that's just not the case at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3176.536" offset="12809488">Well, we think that -- I'm sorry, he -- he says that not only that we don't place great credence to that but that our entire argument rests on the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.667" offset="12846059">He says the SEC seems to sit on its hands saying the language of the statute doesn't require a purchase and sale accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.169" offset="12868002">All of those marvelous policy considerations that the Court articulated in Blue Chip, marvelous from his perspective, the SEC completely disregards.</text>

            <text syncTime="3211.489" offset="12949295">They have an investment adviser and a client to that investment adviser, much different than Blue Chip.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.054" offset="12967581">Here, you have a very definite limited class of potential plaintiffs, expressly identified in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3224.937" offset="13003107">It's not a statute that talks in terms of the general public, the kind of person who could be sitting by the wayside and a purchase and sale securities transaction that Blue Chip was worried about.</text>
