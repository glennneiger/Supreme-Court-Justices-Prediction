            <label>Mr. Louis A. Ruprecht</label>
            <text syncTime="60.207" offset="240744">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.232" offset="248895">I think a brief review of the facts with be an order in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.558" offset="266136">The petitioner was convicted of receiving offense and a conspiracy to receive goods in interstate commerce which had been stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.171" offset="312633">The hijacking which formed the basis for theft offense occurred on April 3, 1973 and several men were caught with the stolen goods in their possession, the petitioner not included on April 5, 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.497" offset="385985">During this very period of time, the petitioner had been the subject and was still being the subject of a very intense electronic surveillance by the Government because on March 14, 1973, the Government had obtained a Title III order from Judge Lacey in the District of New Jersey permitting the Government to intercept all telephone communications on two of his business telephones in Linden, New Jersey and so for 20 days up until April 3rd or April 4, 1973, the Government was actively overhearing these business conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.153" offset="544601">At the conclusion of that 20-day period, the Government came back and obtained another order renewing for another 20 days, the telephone tap on the two business telephones but this time also secured an order permitting electronic surveillance of office conversations that would be taking place in an enclosed office in the north westerly corner Mr. Dalia's building.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.919" offset="651598">There was nothing in that order of authorization and nothing in the application therefore which gave any hint as to how the Government intended to install this listening device if one was to be installed.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.786" offset="703112">And indeed, Judge Lacey asked no questions on the strike force attorney who made the application, gave no informal information in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.523" offset="750028">On the night of April 5, 1973, three FBI agents opened the window of the building, walked down a corridor and in the process of or in a time of about two or three hours installed the listening device in the ceiling of Mr. Dalia's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.472" offset="833829">At that point in time, it was activated and for 20 more days, all office conversations were overheard and recorded as well as the office telephones.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.139" offset="888477">On about April 27th, the Government went back and made another application to continue the electronic surveillance and got another 20-day order for both the office conversations as well as the two telephones.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.211" offset="952842">The upshot of all these was that as a result of the electronic surveillance, there were over 5,000 telephone calls intercepted and recorded over a thousand separately designated office conversations overheard and recorded and over 1,500 tape real hours of overheard conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.629" offset="1046465">I bring this to the Court's attention because I think it's significant when it is coupled with the underlying complaint that the petitioner has with respect to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.502" offset="1094008">And that is the activity of the Government in conducting the breaking and entry without any court authorization, without any advisement to the Court and indeed without any statutory authorization.</text>
