            <text syncTime="77.686" offset="414072">I represent the petitioner in this case Mrs. Bessie Givhan.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.626" offset="433925">Question presented here is whether a teacher was unprotected by the First Amendment against termination of her employment for the particular view she expressed, nearly because those views were communicated privately to her principle rather than in a public forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.556" offset="525563">The case arose in 1971 in Mississippi during the throes of court ordered school desegregation.</text>

            <text syncTime="118.284" offset="576554">The action wasn't taken because of just some communications based on a total attitude evaluated by the principal, was it not?</text>

            <label>Mr. David Rubin</label>
            <text syncTime="131.294" offset="628590">No Your Honor, the District Court in this case found that the primer indeed almost the entire reason for the termination of the petitioner's employment was because of her criticism of certain policies and practices of her School District and her school criticism which was expressed to her principle, criticism that the policies and practices were racially discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.508" offset="733393">The Court of Appeals while they accepted the factual findings of the District Court concluded that the communications for which he was penalized were unprotected by the First Amendment because they were expressed privately to her principal rather than in a public forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.864" offset="810820">This is a ruling that the respondents have conceded was erroneous and rightly so because if the First Amendment means anything, it means that an individual is protected against punishment by the Government for expressing a particular idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.013" offset="895457">This isn't to say that First Amendment interests are absolute and that the interest of the School District as the employer can't be accommodated.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.850" offset="934745">But this Court created a means for such accommodation in its Pickering decision which established the balancing test under which the teacher's free speech interest is to be balanced against the interest of the School District as employer implicated by the teacher's expressions.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.081" offset="1019695">The Court of Appeals thought that to recognize a free speech interest in a teacher to express a particular idea to her principal would necessarily imply a right to an audience with the principal as The Court of Appeals put it.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.818" offset="1110601">But no right of access of any sort need be implied by the ruling that we seek from this Court, the -- for the purposes of this case, it may be assumed arguendo that the school authorities could absolutely bar by rule or regulation or directive access that might present a constitutional question but it would be not the constitutional question presented by this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="320.822" offset="1386663">Well, why are -- (A) Why must there be limits and (B) why must there be regulations if in a normal course of the teacher-principal relationship the teacher knows that the principal say has a meeting from four to five and she comes up to him at one minute to four and says, Look, this policy that you're enforcing seems to be all bad and I don't think it's consistent with a constitution?</text>
            <text syncTime="350.409" offset="1505050">The principal says, Sorry, I'd rather go to this meeting, some other time maybe, but not now?</text>

            <text syncTime="1061.637" offset="4349889">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.890" offset="4374967">Basically, our position in this case is that the Fifth Circuit reached the right result but for the wrong reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.529" offset="4417494">And I must be perfectly candid with this Court and say that I don't think that the First Amendment protection is dependent upon the forum of the degree on publicity or in the manner in which it's exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.671" offset="4486040">The question is whether the communication is or should be constitutionally protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.362" offset="4524805">Now, I would like to take about two minutes and put this case in proper prospective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.100" offset="4559809">First, there is a direct relationship between the quality of a community and the quality of its public education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.476" offset="4601292">Second, you can't get a quality education without quality teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.526" offset="4641520">Now, how do we do this?</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.254" offset="4656358">In Mississippi, a teacher is employed under a written contract, statutory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.138" offset="4687914">She may not be paid unless she has a written contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.370" offset="4708812">During the time of that contract she may be discharged only for incompetence or immoral conduct for a brutal treatment of a pupil for a willful neglect of duties of for other good cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.294" offset="4784567">And our courts have rightly held that a professional contract is something not likely to be done away with and that the statute means what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.106" offset="4839842">But at the end of the contract then there is a decision as to whether a teacher should or should not be reemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.230" offset="4896266">Now, basically, this question is one of management.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.801" offset="4922598">The question is whether or not the petitioner in this case should have been reemployed and we think that that is a proper decision to make and that the management should make it on the basis of daily contact over a long period of time that the Courts are eloquent to make a contrary judgment based solely upon evidence in a record that is put on in a formal atmosphere and upon his personal observation of the teacher on a stand where she obviously is going to be.</text>

            <text syncTime="2173.034" offset="8795512">The administrative staff consisted of the principal who was white, the assistant principal who was black, the elementary supervisor who was black and the guidance councilor for the school who was black and one white secretary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2204.979" offset="8923303">The objection is that the person who took up the tickets had "the choice position".</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.965" offset="8959248">But the facts are that that white was the only person employed at the cafeteria of the white race, the manager was black.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.996" offset="9007313">All other employees were black.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.194" offset="9020165">The white had been hired on the recommendation or appointment rather of the black cafeteria manager made to the cafeteria supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.313" offset="9076590">Now, if we had been discriminating them, the Court could have taken corrective action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.227" offset="9100309">Now, really what we are getting down to you is that we have a teacher and we'd make no argument that she was not a competent teacher so long as she stayed within the scope of our employment but a teacher who was constantly interfering with the operation of the schools under circumstances that we're trying.</text>

            <text syncTime="2309.223" offset="9340217">It was so bad that a consent decree was entered during the summer and we reconstituted this district at that time by agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.075" offset="9387656">Now, in your normal school situation, a kid goes in, in the first grade and he makes his associations, the teachers have worked together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.153" offset="9436035">There are peer groups formed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2368.329" offset="9576678">And the first and most paramount duty was to recreate an atmosphere conducive to the education of the pupils and to get on with the business of giving the best possible education to the students of the district in there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2396.887" offset="9690885">But in order to do it you got to have teachers that will cooperate.</text>
