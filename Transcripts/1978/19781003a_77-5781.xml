            <text syncTime="57.467" offset="333197">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.017" offset="347408">Your Honors, the basic issue in this case is rather passengers who were legitimately present in an automobile that was stopped by a police have standing the challenge to the constitutionality of warrantless search of that automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.742" offset="410311">We advance two grounds for such standings; one is the legitimately present on the premises rule, and the other is the directed that theory for standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.302" offset="464541">The facts in this case can be briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.936" offset="479065">The two petitioners in this case, Frank Rakas and Linnie King were convicted of armed robbery in an Illinois court, and the most significant evidence against them was a sawed-off rifle, which was identified by one of the victims of the robber has being the same weapon which was used by the mask robbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.753" offset="574360">The two robbers in the robbery in question made their getaway from the site of the robbery in a blue Plymouth Roadrunner which was taken from one of the robbery victims.</text>

            <text syncTime="144.095" offset="679790">However, prior to that time, the police officer who was about four miles north of the robbery site noticed a -- not a blue Roadrunner but a purple Roadrunner with a different license number.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.900" offset="734960">He followed this vehicle to a lounge, saw the petitioners and two female companions exit and go into the lounge, and then he returned to his original site near the highway to look for the real getaway car since he knew it was a different license number.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.356" offset="816776">About that time, he heard a radio call noting that the getaway car had been found abandoned, so he considered the possibility that the robbers changed cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.646" offset="857945">He went back to the lounge, called the sheriffs and dispatcher for a description of the suspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.887" offset="890964">He was not given a description, instead he gave him his description of the petitioners who he had seen and he was told that one of the petitioners who I believe would be Mr. King matched the description of one of the robbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.026" offset="955434">As a matter of fact however, we learn from the trial that the robbers in this case were wore ski mask and they wore clothing different from what the petitioners from wearing at the time of their arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.436" offset="1013112">In any event, police officer waited until petitioners left the lounge.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.665" offset="1042056">He followed their car down the highway toward the robbery site, and it was near the site in which a number of police vehicles stopped the car in which petitioners were riding and the search and question was conducted.</text>

            <text syncTime="291.627" offset="1269844">The trial court decided that since neither the petitioner own the car that they did not have standing to contest the search and their motion suppressed then was summarily disposed off on that grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.517" offset="1353435">The trial court nor the appellate court discussed the legitimately on a premises rule which we rely upon here.</text>
