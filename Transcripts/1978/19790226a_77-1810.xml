            <label>Mr. Daniel J. McAuliffe</label>
            <text syncTime="35.888" offset="246888">I believe that they are adequately set forth in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.733" offset="262353">Essentially Mr. Chief Justice and the Court, this is a discrimination case.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.272" offset="276459">It involves the constitutionality of the New Mexico Electrical Energy Tax Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.651" offset="301955">Let me explain initially exactly how that energy tax act operates and I think you will understand the discriminatory operation of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.607" offset="345840">Section 3 of the tax purports to impose a levy on the generation of electricity generated in New Mexico for the states that is on the privilege of generating electricity for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.134" offset="403937">While that appears even handed, Section 9 of the act significantly affects the way that tax operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.401" offset="432985">Section 9 is the credit provision and the two pertinent provisions we believe are Sections 9(b) and (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="89.458" offset="461197">Section 9(b) provides that a generator who produces electricity in New Mexico which will be consumed in New Mexico may take energy tax that’s imposed and credit it against a gross receipts tax liability, which it will incur upon the retail sale of the electricity.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.044" offset="551581">Again, that credit provision, Section 9(b), is available and applies only if the electricity is generated and consumed in New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.443" offset="593168">Section 9(c) deals with a separate situation, because if you look at the wholesaler of electricity, the local generator for example, who will sell the electricity initially for resale, the Section 9(b) credit is of no assistance to that entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.536" offset="661504">The simple reason that the gross receipts tax does not apply to a sale for resale at the wholesale level.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.075" offset="683656">As a result, there is no gross receipts tax liability against which to credit the energy tax assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.275" offset="712495">Section 9(c) takes care of that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.702" offset="722213">Indeed it was included in the act specifically to take care of that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.295" offset="740603">What Section 9(c) provides is that the credit granted by Section 9 will be assigned forward by the wholesale seller which for purposes of argument I will call the generator, generally is – because there is some confusion generated when you try and describe both parties of that transaction, the generator is normally the seller in the wholesale transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.610" offset="829837">The generator assigns that credit forward to the purchaser in the wholesale transaction who is generally the retail seller.</text>

            <text syncTime="238.834" offset="1058670">The net effect of these provisions throughout the course of this litigation has been undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.171" offset="1084061">The energy tax applies only to electricity, which is generated in New Mexico and transmitted to other states for retail sale and consumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.500" offset="1125334">It collects no revenue whatsoever from electricity which is generated and consumed in the state of New Mexico.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="267.348" offset="1172773">But if you look at the overall effect of the tax, the tax structure of New Mexico, New Mexico consumers of electricity may well pay just as much as consumers in other states, isn't that true?</text>

          <turn speaker="daniel_j_mcauliffe" startTime="284.763" stopTime="329.365">
            <label>Mr. Daniel J. McAuliffe</label>
            <text syncTime="284.763" offset="1242467">At the consumer level, I am not sure that that's true Mr. Justice Rehnquist, because then you are talking into account whatever tax maybe applied at the consumption level and the state of consumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.256" offset="1304430">New Mexico consumers pay a total tax or the total tax if you take it all the way down to the level of consumption in New Mexico is a 4% gross receipts tax imposed by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.017" offset="1323447">And when we get to the constitutional argument, our position is that -- the state's position is obviously that saves the energy tax, but our position is that even when you look at the whole scheme of taxation, looking at the treatment of wholesalers you do not have that equality of treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.881" offset="1394918">You have a facial equivalence looking at the scheme as a whole, but at the wholesale level there is no New Mexico tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="341.729" offset="1470255">The initial aspect of the discrimination issue is that which involves the Tax Reform Act of 1976 which was passed during pendency of this litigation, we have particular reference to Section 2121(a) which is codified as Title 15, United States Code, Section 391.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.706" offset="1538173">That statute provides in effect that no state may impose a tax on or with respect to the generation or transmission of electricity which discriminates against out of state producers, generators, wholesales, retailers or consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.789" offset="1610480">The statute also defines what is discriminatory and that is, if it imposes a greater tax burden on electricity whether directly or indirectly on electricity, which is generated and transmitted in the interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.990" offset="1679339">We believe that the New Mexico electrical energy tax clearly satisfies that definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.070" offset="1703685">There has never been any dispute that it is a tax on or with respect to the generation or transmission of electricity and it is discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.706" offset="1742242">It imposes a greater tax burden on electricity which is generated and transmitted to other states, states outside of New Mexico that has never been disputed.</text>

            <text syncTime="488.316" offset="2056652">There was a bill introduced approximately a year before the Tax Reform Act, which would have stricken down all state generation taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="529.711" offset="2222268">Now the change which was made was when the different versions passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate went to a conference committee and the conference committee changed the language to its present formulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="547.322" offset="2292694">There is no other explanation for the change and I think without inquiry and speculation of the legislative record, we are entitled to assume that they adopted the intent of the Senate as well and the intent of the Senate at least is reflected in debate was quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.773" offset="2346506">The Senate Finance Committee describes the type of tax they are talking about and it describes on all force the electrical energy tax that was stated in New Mexico.</text>

            <text syncTime="714.446" offset="2961115">Turning then to the constitutional argument, the state's defense of the statute is that you can't view the energy tax in isolation that you have to look at the state's entire scheme of taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.111" offset="3011793">Even adopting that as the constitutional test, it does not save the energy tax, because we believe that test involves considerably more than simply looking at tax incidences and tax rates and discovering whether there is some glaring in equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.973" offset="3083264">If that were the analysis and that is the analysis the state employs, then the Halliburton case would have been decided differently, because in the Halliburton case there was facial tax equivalence between the sales tax and the used tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.016" offset="3139480">The difficulty in Halliburton was that one component of that facially equivalent tax structure affected a class of taxpayers differently depending upon whether they were involved in the interstate commerce or not that is exactly what happens here when you look at the wholesale transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.757" offset="3214399">Again, if the wholesaler sells that electricity for consumption in New Mexico, it will eventually receive a tax, a private tax rebate from the retail seller in the amount of any credit actually received which will wholly erase any energy tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.639" offset="3289945">The interstate wholesaler, the wholesaler who markets that electricity which is consumed in other states receives no such credits and pays the energy tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.333" offset="3324740">In effect, the interstate transaction is taxed; the intrastate transaction is tax free.</text>

            <text syncTime="820.559" offset="3385657">The opinions below do not address the issue of discrimination as wholesalers at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.495" offset="3401331">In the appendix and our answers to the Bureau of Revenues' interrogatories reading them together with the affidavits which were submitted in connection with our initial motion for summary judgment, you'll find the most complete figures available after 1974 and they are only partial, they do not include figures for Southern California Edison.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.930" offset="3479071">They indicate that our purchases of wholesale of electricity were approximately four and a half million kilowatt hours of electricity and our sales of electricity were approximately -- at the wholesale level were approximately 7.5 million kilowatt hours for a total of 1.2 billion kilowatt hours of electricity.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.418" offset="3557021">That is roughly 10 to 12% of the total electricity generated by us in New Mexico that's the approximate volume of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.550" offset="3585546">It's of course going to fluctuate year-by-year depending upon demand and whether particular facilities are online or offline, but I think that's a fair rough approximation.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.168" offset="3628074">Under the Halliburton case, the test is whether the component tax provides equal treatment to in-state and out of state taxpayers similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.985" offset="3671333">We contend that this tax does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.452" offset="3685230">When you compare the situation of the wholesaler who sells intrastate with the situation of the wholesaler who sells interstate, there's no evenhanded treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.201" offset="3724204">They are subject to disparate burdens and that is discriminatory and although there has been a significant change in recent years, a reformulation of the test which this court will apply to state taxation and interstate commerce that principle remains unchanged and that is that a state tax may not discriminate against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.465" offset="3801213">We also contend that this tax imposes undue burdens upon interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.658" offset="3825977">The state's response to this is that the tax cannot impose an undue or what used to be called a multiple burden on interstate commerce, because it only applies to the active generation, which only happens in New Mexico, we contend that is a fiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.397" offset="3888985">As a practical matter, you cannot -- at the time electricity is generated in New Mexico, under the state's own regulations it is subject to a potential credit whether that credit, the potential credit becomes actual or whether it vanishes depends upon a subsequent determination as to the state of consumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.052" offset="3963591">At the time that that determination is made that electricity is already in the transmission pipeline, if you will, traveling at the speed of light.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.264" offset="4000475">The tax is whether it's phrased a tax on sale or a tax on consumption, liability for that tax, assessment of the amount of that tax that is due cannot be made at the point of generation.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.377" offset="4048854">It can only be made at the time that this, that is determined whether that tax is consumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.506" offset="4073409">So we contend that the tax is perfectly analogous to the tax of Michigan Wisconsin Pipeline versus Calvert.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.134" offset="4103920">There the tax was imposed on the taking of gas, taking of natural gas and the principle vice of the tax was that it was imposed on the entire volume of gas taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.095" offset="4163793">This Court has sensibly held that the vice there was on a portion to activities within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.797" offset="4182601">This is exactly the same tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.482" offset="4193259">This is a privilege tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.503" offset="4197334">This is the tax in what Michigan Wisconsin was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.923" offset="4207052">This is a tax which is imposed on the entire volume of gasoline that is taken, the entire volume of electricity taken outside of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.116" offset="4243832">This is just as much a tax on the exit from the borders of New Mexico of electricity as was the tax in Michigan Wisconsin.</text>

            <text syncTime="1090.771" offset="4466500">The State of New Mexico's Bureau of Revenue concedes that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.737" offset="4478307">One of its regulations that says that energy that's generated at that point in time are subject to a potential credit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1542.142">Let me give the Court three hypotheticals, which will I hope illustrate the non-discriminatory aspect of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.479">In the first hypothetical, assume a state has a 2% generation tax and no other taxes on electricity per se and that's obviously non-discriminatory because the 2% tax applies to all electricity, no matter where it's sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.674">In the second example, assume that the state later imposes a sales tax of 2%, a flat 2%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.420">The total tax burden on instate electricity would then be 4% and the total tax burden on out of state electricity would be 2%, only the 2% generation tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.541">Obviously, again the burden is greater on instate electricity than on out of state electricity and it's non-discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.919">In the third example, assume that the state had only a sales tax and no generation tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.155">It later decides to add a generation tax, but does not want to raise the total tax burden for instate electricity, so it allows that 2% generation tax to be credited against its sales tax and this is not hypothetical at all, this is actually New Mexico's situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.137">The total tax burden on instate electricity is still 4% and the total tax burden on electrify generated, but marketed and sold elsewhere is still 2% and the burden is greater on instate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3268.167">Mr. Justice Blackmun let me clarify one thing, they do not have those two letters after the Bill leaves the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.601">Those two letters are both at least a month and half prior to the debate on the Senate floor, the letters in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.358">The State asks us to entertain several assumptions as a basis for justifying the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.362">The first is that we should assume that there are no wholly intrastate New Mexico wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.343">The problem with that may it please the Court, is that if there are no holding New Mexico intrastate wholesalers then why is Section 9 (c) in the act and in our legislative, our treatment of the legislative history before the state legislature, it's very clear which is set forth in our opening brief that what they were concerned with was the fact that an intrastate wholesaler, which plenty of them exist could not take advantage of the Section 9 (b) credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.861">So, obviously the New Mexico legislature was legislating to take care of a specific situation which did in fact exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.804">The second assumption they ask us to entertain is that New Mexico has in fact passed some different tax that they have in effect reduced their sales tax to 2% and imposed the generation tax even handedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.542">I think we've adequately shown that that is not in fact what they've done and we cannot save this tax of by referring to some hypothetical tax which New Mexico might have enacted but concededly did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.156">The final assumption is that the constitutional case law establishes an equivalence of tax rule.</text>
