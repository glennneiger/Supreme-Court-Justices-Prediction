            <text syncTime="68.208" offset="376247">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.273" offset="396413">Respondent brought this Section 1983 action alleging a violation of Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.179" offset="440090">The facts are basically uncontroverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.152" offset="455973">Respondent was born December 8, 1949 and originally given the name Linny spelled L-I-N-N-Y, C-A-R-R-O-L-L, McCollon with an O-N.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.995" offset="511352">He informally adopted the name in which he uses today in this proceeding with the different spelling of Linnie, middle name Carl, and McCollan with an A-N.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.185" offset="572061">The date of birth significant only because later in by 1972 respondent had a Texas driver's license identifying him as Linnie Carl McCollan and through error the birth date of December 8, 1948 was inserted and even though he knew of it did not correct it and therefore it became part of his assumed identity.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="139.382" offset="660877">And whose date of birth was that?</text>

            <text syncTime="147.355" offset="692746">These facts would not be particularly significant except for the remarkable coincidence and I say a coincidence because that's all the record will support that respondent's older brother whose true name was Leonard decided in 1972 to adopt the identical assumed name and went so far as to seek a duplicate driver's license in the name of Linnie Carl McCollan.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.727" offset="810297">Unfortunate, through some error of Department of Public Safety the same was issued and older brother Leonard had a driver's license but identified him as Linnie Carl McCollan date of birth December 8, 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.926" offset="867035">All information is the same including the driver's license number being identical but the only difference in the two driver's license is being the photographs on the license themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="209.881" offset="942895">Probably, I think you're absolutely correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.625" offset="953866">It would've said that duplicate on the one that Leonard had in any case, that you're right, it would have (Inaudible) it.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.818" offset="978631">But other than the duplicate words and the photograph, the identifying information was identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.228" offset="1004335">Leonard acting as Linnie was then arrested in October of 1972 on a drug violation was booked as Linnie Carl McCollan was released on bail as Linnie Carl McCollan signed all the papers that he signed as Linnie McCollan and then left to town presumably because his bonds been later surrendered the bond in sought to have a warrant issued for the missing Linnie Carl McCollan.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.704" offset="1138186">The Justice of the Peace dutifully issued a warrant for the arrest of Linnie Carl McCollan, a copy of which is in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.817" offset="1178624">One significant item in this point, the warrant was issued on November 3, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.816" offset="1202657">This suit is against petitioner Baker who was sheriff of Potter County but he was not sheriff of Potter County up till this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.304" offset="1232541">In fact, certain events happened one in this case, one being the death of Sheriff Gaither, his predecessor.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.951" offset="1259186">Sheriff Baker was then appointed on November 28, 1972, newly in office.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.545" offset="1289592">Then the respondent becomes involved when on December 26, 1972,a Dallas police officer stopped the respondent for traffic violation reported the name and identifying information through their central office and was informed that there was a Potter County warrant outstanding for Linnie Carl McCollan.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.489" offset="1377364">He dutifully arrested him, took him to the station, a respondent protested that he wasn't the man wanted and there's no evidence of whether this was a unique statement but in any case the police officer did ask his superior to contact Potter County.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.522" offset="1453432">They compared the identifying information and as you might expect said no, this is the man, that's the man we want with a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.007" offset="1491362">In December 30th, Potter County Deputy with a warrant went to Dallas, picked up respondent, returned him to the Potter County Jail, evening of December 30th.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.788" offset="1538487">Sheriff Baker against doing this action was brought -- was not present at the jail at that time, had left the evening and was going to be gone over the New Year's holidays and even though he had contact with his office received no notice of any protest by respondent that he was not the right man wanted.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.970" offset="1927293">No, sir, Your Honor, and this is the point that it's being raised by respondents in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.359" offset="1948818">When Leonard was arrested as Linnie Carl McCollan, he was fingerprinted and photographed.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.946" offset="1967208">He was arrested and both to answer the police -- City Police Department then transferred to Potter County but Potter County also photographed and finger printed Leonard.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.056" offset="2003571">At the time they did not take and this is one of the points that respondent makes, they did not take fingerprints and photographs with them to Dallas when they picked him up.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.536" offset="2041501">They returned him and apparently did not compare the photographs at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.638" offset="2061876">Immediately, on January 2nd, when Sheriff Baker arrived back to jail was informed that a man was contending that he was not the correct Linnie Carl McCollan.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.161" offset="2103986">He immediately investigated, compared the photographs and they had the arresting officer had kept the duplicate driver's license that had been issued to Leonard for some reason or there was some problem with it and they brought respondent down from the jail.</text>

            <text syncTime="621.796" offset="2590595">No, sir and we're not -- we're certainly not contending there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.991" offset="2607313">Our initial position in this case is simply that we have not stated a violation of due process where there is arrest pursuant to a warrant that describes the individual in the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.721" offset="2666245">That the respondent's position on this would be tantamount to suggesting that due process not only requires identification to a warrant but that the most efficient means of identification must be used or one cannot rely upon the warrant and it is our position that in this case, there's the police officer has traditionally been held to the stand that he must have either a valid warrant and there's no contention this warrant is not valid or rely upon probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.610" offset="2821831">Here, the arrest was supported arrest and confinement by a valid warrant in the name of respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.469" offset="2853282">That respondent as in the case of anyone who is arrested and later acquitted was determined not to be the one who should've been arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.234" offset="2888286">He was released in due course through the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.838" offset="2902706">So, the threshold question we believe the Fifth Circuit overlooked was whether there was in fact a violation of due process because there was in fact a warrant for their arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.837" offset="2954742">The Fifth Circuit reasoned from the reversed side of the case by concluding that being demonstrated after the fact that he should not have been arrested therefore it was a false imprisonment, that false imprisonment is an intentional tort and under their own case of Bryan versus Jones, it can be read to suggest that the only thing necessary for this tort is that someone was in fact confined.</text>

            <text syncTime="742.600" offset="3073755">However, even under Bryan versus Jones, there was a preliminary finding and that is that there was a confinement without any process and it may be that under Monroe versus Pape, we can presume intent to confine without process when there is in fact no process.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.653" offset="3157974">But it seems a little farfetched to presume intent to confine without process when there was in fact process naming the person arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.696" offset="3202173">Second difficulty with the Fifth Circuit's initial approach to the case is that they concluded that Sheriff Baker could be held responsible for the acts of his deputies and because it was necessary in this case to attribute the acts of the deputies to Sheriff Baker if he was to have liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.156" offset="3303946">They did so by simply suggesting that he is responsible for the acts of his deputies.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.941" offset="3323173">He authorized them to go so then in fact, he committed the confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.941" offset="3343130">Again, we find it rather difficult to conclude that Sheriff Baker intended to confine the man when his first action upon learning that this particular man was confined was to investigate and release him.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.384" offset="3396942">And the only way we can get to Sheriff Baker on the confinement is to apply the doctrine of respondeat superior which we believe this Court should as well as in the city cases in Monell should extend your conclusion there that doctrine of respondeat superior should not apply to sheriffs either.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.605" offset="3485759">Respondents would take one further step and say that the sheriff in Texas is responsible for the acts of his deputies.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.017" offset="3511463">And he is statutory responsible for supervising his deputies and can be held as a surety for them but it would not be reasonable to use this is a basis for extending respondeat superior to the sheriff because then it would tend to make 1983 a variable statute depending on what state statutes happen to apply in any given jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.217" offset="3616266">The Fifth Circuit acknowledged that there might be some question here on respondeat superior so they then shifted their analysis to the sheriff and suggested that it should be the sheriff's own acts or conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.298" offset="3668616">The sheriff did not act affirmably in any way to confine or restrain respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.274" offset="3700485">Therefore, they suggested that it was a failure to act, a failure to have implemented a policy of transmitting photographs and fingerprints which he himself said after the fact as a result of this, he investigated and determined that this would be a good policy.</text>
