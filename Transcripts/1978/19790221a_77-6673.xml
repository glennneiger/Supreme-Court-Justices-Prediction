            <text syncTime="173.102" offset="795773">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.680" offset="810088">Brown versus Texas is a direct appeal from the county court at law, number 2 for El Paso County, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.837" offset="834748">From a misdemeanor conviction for the failure to identify himself by appellant and to the report of his name and address.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.178" offset="868080">The facts are that on December 9, 1977 at approximately noon, two uniformed El Paso police patrolman in the squad car looked down an alley and noticed appellant and another individual who were apparently only a couple of feet apart walking in opposite directions.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.610" offset="941850">The officer could not tell if the individuals had met or had spoken.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.453" offset="965151">Both men were black.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.991" offset="971316">No other activity was noticed.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.240" offset="980302">There was no report of suspicious or criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.417" offset="997021">The officer stated that they decided to stop appellant to ask him his name and that that was the sole purpose for the stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.547" offset="1037563">The appellant was stopped and the officers did ask him for his name and also for the reason for his presence in the alley.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.974" offset="1067238">Appellant protested the stop stating that the officer had neither right nor reason to detain him.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.144" offset="1095973">He did not resist the arrest or stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.516" offset="1109452">Brown was padded down then and no weapons, drugs or any of the contraband were found on his person.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.233" offset="1136306">But he was placed under arrest for the failure to identify himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.242" offset="1152293">The other individual in the alley was never stopped or questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.161" offset="1172041">Now on the way to jail, appellant gave the officers his name but he was still booked for the offense the officers stating within his viewpoint the offense was complete at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.805" offset="1214568">He was later on found guilty in an on-jury trial and was fined 500 -- $45.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.536" offset="1241527">Now, the provision in question does not carry any term, jail term or imprisonment simply provides for a maximum penalty of a $200.00 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.306" offset="1276635">The provision is Section 3802 of the Texas Penal Code which makes it a misdemeanor to refuse to give a report of one's name and address to a peace officer who has lawfully stopped one and requested that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.200" offset="1332224">This case is significant and different from DeFillippo that you've just heard in the following respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.870" offset="1354898">The Detroit ordinance at least attempts to put in some sort of a Terry Standard that there must be suspicious conduct or criminal conduct afoot which would allow a police officer to investigate further and ask for one's name.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.387" offset="1408920">The Texas statute does not have any such requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="381.270" offset="1628453">What I'm saying is simply by reading unlawful, there's nothing to tell you whether it must be criminal activity for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.018" offset="1655411">It may be that the Texas legislature thought it was lawful for a person, police officer to stop a person on walking down the street and asking for his name for no other reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="396.310" offset="1688639">Well then you -- you do are suggesting that neither the Texas legislature nor the Texas Courts knew what lawful meant?</text>

            <text syncTime="403.113" offset="1715806">I'm suggesting they probably didn't consider it carefully enough Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.044" offset="1727509">The statute is not drafted carefully enough to set forth what is lawful and what is not and that is one of our principal arguments here.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.830" offset="1758647">Now, also in the DeFillippo there was evidence of other criminal activity, drunkenness, perhaps some sort of indecency or sexual conduct, possession of drugs, possibly impersonation of a police sergeant.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.380" offset="1816848">In this case here, we're solely dealing with an offense involving only one type of criminal conduct and that was the offense of failing to identify himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.493" offset="1853315">Now, DeFillippo did not involve a prosecution for failure to identify.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.583" offset="1869720">This case it does involve that kind of prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.104" offset="1879751">Also, in DeFillippo, of course it was a question of good faith reliance by the police officer on the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.521" offset="1905455">Before the trial court and before this Court, the appellant has challenged its unconstitu -- the constitutionality of the Texas statute for facial vagueness and for overbreadth because it punishes not innocent conduct Your Honor but protected conduct and there's a big difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.529" offset="1973478">Conduct protected by the First, Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the United States constitution making the statute therefore invalid under the Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.632" offset="2025932">First question is comes up into the vagueness argument, can a police officer ask someone questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.472" offset="2049233">This is apart from the ability to stop someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.828" offset="2062712">Can he ask someone a question?</text>

            <text syncTime="2901.690" offset="11710151">And the Fifth Amendment self-privilege against self-incrimination is not a right that can be asserted vicariously on behalf of large groups of people.</text>

            <text syncTime="3211.962" offset="12951176">Reading Terry into the words lawfully stopped looking through the record there I don't know that the court below ever considered Terry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.604" offset="12985762">And I can't see simply by saying a state legislature putting in the words lawful or unlawful reads in or reads out Supreme Court decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.070" offset="13027662">And under the decision in this Court, Connally versus General Construction Company, the terms of a penal statute creating a new offense must be sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.807" offset="13094640">That's the test of vagueness not that some court some place may be able to read in Terry or read it out in a particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.512" offset="13133406">Otherwise, all you have to do to make a statute pass the vagueness test here would be just to put in the words lawfully stopped or unlawful detention or whatever you may want to read into the statute by those words.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="3274.082" offset="13199653">But don't many statutes in fact do that, for instance, criminal test which statutes doesn't -- oh, unlawfully on the premises and -- it may be a question of considerable doubt in that particular case whether a person is or is not lawfully on the premises.</text>

            <label>Mr. Raymond C. Caballero</label>
            <text syncTime="3288.268" offset="13256495">I agree with you sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.710" offset="13266213">In the situation where you read in the words lawful there are other standards for example unlawfully on the premises normally takes to me you're on the premises and you don't have permission to be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.767" offset="13306441">But the words lawfully stopped are so vague it's a question of degree I agree with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.552" offset="13325563">That they are so vague lawfully stopped that in this case for example this Court under facts that I would consider that it was not a lawful stop simply stopping the person in an alley who had not been doing anything wrong, no suspicion or report that he had been doing anything wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.972" offset="13391287">Court held below that it was a lawful stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.595" offset="13401736">Now what the court did below, the Court had serious reservations about the constitutionality of the statute but simply presumed that the statute was valid and read in to the statute apparently that this was also a valid stop as applied in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.926" offset="13463071">Now if the stop had been unlawful, necessarily my client would've been acquitted and you would not be reviewing the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.686" offset="13502151">If the stop is lawful, excuse me, if the stop was unlawful under the facts of the case then it would be like Norwell where you simply apply in the -- there was protected activity, it never reached the constitutional issue by that means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.734" offset="13562337">And incidentally in Norwell versus Cincinnati, I went back and looked at it, you -- this Court did say we are persuaded at the ordinance as applied to this petitioner on the facts of this case operated to punish his constitutionally protected speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.581" offset="13613746">So that was decided on First Amendment grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.315" offset="13632658">The Fifth Amendment question in this case, it's very difficult sometimes to see how the invocation of that right to -- under the Fifth Amendment can be valid or it applies to a name only.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.684" offset="13686157">However, in the situation where for example I saw a case out of Texas, the Miller case cited on the brief where a person had made a false claim for insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.368" offset="13724818">He claimed that he was dead, the claim was made through his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.324" offset="13736626">Later on he was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.403" offset="13744985">Had he given his name Joe Dolks or anything else, that person had never would've put the crime --</text>

            <text syncTime="3415.258" offset="13764420">Well, aren't you confusing probable cause with incriminating?</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.550" offset="13785527">The disclosure of the name may lead to the arrest but the disclosure of the name per se doesn't incriminate him?</text>

            <text syncTime="3437.336" offset="13852714">Incrimination goes beyond mere evidence presented in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.022" offset="13863476">Incrimination means something that they may subject me to prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.211" offset="13880195">And I can't see how you can totally separate the concepts of evidence in Court and probable cause also evidence to give someone a reasonable cause to arrest him -- a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.899" offset="13922931">I -- separating the two, I have a difficult time with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.488" offset="13941321">To me they're both incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.808" offset="13946650">One allows evidence to be presented in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.837" offset="13958771">The other one allows my arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.708" offset="13970160">In either case it's incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.436" offset="13993148">But reaching the cons -- how would you ever -- under the facts of this case, how would you ever test the constitutionality of the statute if you didn't get beyond the facts of this particular case and find out whether there was constitutionally protected conduct which was being punished by the statute here which is exactly what appellant is trying to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.782" offset="14078516">And is there constitutionally protected conduct which this -- the statute in this case makes criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.140" offset="14107982">The fact is you do have a right to walk down the street and stand mute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.434" offset="14125119">Under the case Norwell versus Cincinnati, you do have the right to walk down the street and tell the policeman I don't want to tell you anything.</text>
