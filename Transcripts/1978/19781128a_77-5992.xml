            <text syncTime="16.303" offset="168626">The appellant in this case is confined in Austin State Hospital as a result of an order of indefinite commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.450" offset="197151">The appellant came from a disturbed family and in December of 1975 following a family argument, he was taken to jail and minor criminal charges were filed against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.407" offset="241037">Those charges were subsequently dismissed and in their place the state instituted indefinite commitment proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.573" offset="273638">The commitment trial lasted for five days, during which time the jury heard conflicting testimony as to the need to commit the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.411" offset="313031">The appellant urged that the standard of proof in his case should be beyond a reasonable doubt but the jury was instructed to make its finding on clear unequivocal and convincing evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="92.762" offset="474467">The appellant had urged that "beyond a reasonable doubt" be required but that was overruled and the court instructed clear and convincing evidence or clear unequivocal and convincing evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.732" offset="514278">The jury found that he was to be committed for an indefinite period of time and the appellant filed his appeal in the intermediate state appellate court on the basis that proof beyond a reasonable doubt is required by the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.150" offset="575927">That court agreed with the appellant and reversed the order of commitment, but on appeal to the State Supreme Court, that Court found that a mere preponderance of the evidence was all that was necessary to indefinitely confine a person in a mental hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.283" offset="636531">That court therefore reversed the Court of Civil Appeals and affirmed the order of commitment from the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.585" offset="665684">As a result of this order of commitment, the appellant has been confined behind the locked doors of Boston State Hospital for almost three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.210" offset="700165">He can't leave the facility, his movements, his activities; his visitors within the hospital are all restricted subject to supervision by the staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.039" offset="747499">He's been subjected to chemical therapy and to twenty-two electroshock treatments.</text>

            <text syncTime="201.223" offset="908309">It's possible under the statute; it is actually required under the statute to reach a third issue regarding mental incompetency, but the state failed to plead that, so it was not submitted to the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.636" offset="1109870">The appellant has been confined for three years, but in addition to the confinement, the appellant also has been stigmatized -- the state by labeling him a mentally ill person, has labeled him a social deviant.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.964" offset="1171205">And if he ever leaves the hospital, he will be a former mental patient and the studies are replete with evidence that this is a form of social deviancy that is most feared and rejected in our society.</text>

            <text syncTime="321.453" offset="1389171">The interests that are at stake for an appellant in this case and indeed for anyone facing an indefinite commitment are very much the same interests that were at stake in Winship.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.666" offset="1438072">Those are the interests of the juvenile delinquent or a criminal defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.956" offset="1459179">The interests are that of the total loss of his unconditional liberty and the freedom from being stigmatized.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.915" offset="1498990">The interests were found by this Court in that case to be of such transcending value that proof beyond a reasonable doubt would be required of the state before those interests could be sacrificed, that argument was made or that decision rather was made regardless of the fact that the state's motives in juvenile delinquency proceedings were benevolent and very worthwhile motives.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.641" offset="1601912">The motives in fact are very similar here, those of protecting and those of giving treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.620" offset="1633886">The Court's reasoning was very clear in Winship that the reason for requiring the higher standard of proof is that the interest for the individual at stake are so great that the risk of an erroneous confinement cannot be any higher than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.158" offset="1723956">The Texas Supreme Court in its decision totally ignored the teaching of Winship.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.983" offset="1743287">In fact it relied on the very reasoning that was rejected in Winship, that is that the benevolent state motivations justify a lower standard of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.699" offset="1790203">As I said, the state's motivations are almost identical and there seems to be no real justification for using a lower standard of proof based on that and based on Winship.</text>

            <text syncTime="1269.909" offset="5182986">It is the position of the State of Texas that I humbly represent here concerning the due process question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.633" offset="5209945">And we feel that the question involving the statute are the provisions as recognized by the State of Texas concerning reasonable doubt or preponderance does not exist in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.618" offset="5261876">The due process that is followed by the State of Texas does not hinge on the question of whether it should be preponderance of the evidence or beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.825" offset="5306702">It hinges, we feel, on the other necessities of due process which are granted in this particular case and indeed every case of someone who used to be committed in the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.841" offset="5358738">The whole procedure does not begin merely from the question of indefinite commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.126" offset="5387891">The procedure begins basically with the question of whether or not a temporary commitment should be allowed and it indeed is necessary for temporary commitment before indefinite commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.685" offset="5430105">A person or a physician must notify court that physician or persons must be recognized by that court and that court then sets aside two physicians who are responsible for evaluating the condition of the person who is to be evaluated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.536" offset="5509517">And then you have a notice, have a hearing before a judge and maybe committed for some 90 days in the Texas Mental Health hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.442" offset="5549119">The judge is able to stop this proceeding at any point up until the time that the person has entered into that procedure and indeed upon entering the particular mental institution he could be discharged immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.797" offset="5598542">In the event that a person is discharged and comes before a judge again concerning his mental capacity, there is no guarantee that the temporary commitment will not be tried again, and indeed it has in this particular case there were some eight temporary commitments.</text>

            <label>Mr. James Hury</label>
            <text syncTime="1398.788" offset="5698539">My understanding Mr. Chief Justice is that there is a minimum requirement of two mandatory reviews or one mandatory review every six months or two per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.600" offset="5741798">I do believe in just my own knowledge that there is considerably more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.230" offset="5768338">I do not believe that the State of Texas allows someone to languish in a building somewhere and only see them once every six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.109" offset="5807835">I am prepared to represent and I believe that we provide them with competent psychiatric evaluation as much as possible or as much as the facilities allow that they are under psychiatric evaluation and indeed that the drugs and the treatment which are recognized by the medical society is trying to help these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.993" offset="5899368">The indefinite commitment which-- there were two in this particular case follows a sworn petition which is presented by the judge again two –- in this case two psychiatrists and I believe it is required that at least one be a psychiatrist that must evaluate this person within 15 days of a hearing of this particular type.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.168" offset="6012008">An attorney can and is almost and I believe is always provided that seven days before the particular hearing notice must be given again, a jury is available and indeed at the end of that particular procedure if after a jury verdict, a judge does not agree with that verdict he might order the return of the lawsuit to another jury in ordering a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.278" offset="6116498">This particular procedure, it is the hope of the State of Texas, forms the basis for an entire evaluation of some possibility of whether or not this person does represent a danger to himself or others and indeed try in some way to make this person available once again to society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.386" offset="6208867">There can be no doubt that the question involved here does involve some loss of liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.986" offset="6239274">The idea is whether or not this loss of liberty is analogous to a penal institution and that loss of liberty being a total and complete deprivation of liberty for a specified period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.483" offset="6309282">It is only pointed out that we do feel that the procedures whereby the commitment is -– the committed person is evaluated and indeed the very possibility that upon the day of his admission he could be released, points to the idea among other things that this is not analogous to a prison, it is not analogous to a set period of time in which a person must languish in prison before his release even considering parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.539" offset="6429550">The provisions of the Mental Health Codes and the mental health provisions of these hospitals does not render this a prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.649" offset="6469987">It renders it a place where we hope will assume small success to be able to help people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.508" offset="6493393">I think there's another basic problem here as to whether or not the person who is considered for both procedures, the criminal procedure and the civil commitment procedure, whether or not that person is of a mind to be able to adequately decide what is best for that person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.055" offset="6563610">The thought or idea of a culpable defendant in a criminal matter conspicuously concern someone who is available to input by counsel, by other persons who are trying to represent that person before a court of law, his ability to evaluate his position and his possibilities while confronted with the state are available to a person who we can -- who the system assumes is culpable if there's no question of psychiatric problem raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.955" offset="6703208">The problem I think is particularly available as to what in the world are we going to do with someone who does not completely understand what's going on about him, as to someone whose ability to evaluate his ability to proceed in life, his ability to understand what the people around him need in addition to his own need, and I think the particular problem here is that if a person does not wish to seek help that the first problem in effective treatment is to getting that person into a position where he acknowledges that he does have a problem and that he is suffering from some abnormal condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.073" offset="6875617">If this particular provision can be met, and it is the hope that after a person realizes that he has a problem, then the procedures under which this State of Texas proceeds is of hopeful nature that it would return this person to some sort of usable place in society.</text>

            <text syncTime="1724.689" offset="7002154">As a question of whether it's intolerant or not, the problem I think pointed out by the State of Texas, and once again just pointing to Turner, is one of the inexact nature of psychiatric testimony, the inability of certain forms of the medical profession to predict what is going to happen in the future, and as to whether or not that particular ability to predict is available to the question of beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.440" offset="7129109">I think what it will certainly do sir is to reduce the number of people who are committed to treatment because of the ability of counsel to cross examine a psychiatrist and to have him admit that not all psychiatrists agree on what is to happen in a particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2259.389" offset="9140955">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.669" offset="9150046">I'm here today representing the American Psychiatric Association as amicus curiae.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.808" offset="9170631">This court is well aware that psychiatrist who play a critical role in the actual civil commitment preceding, and based on the experience, with the association and its members, we would urge the court not to constitutionalize the burden of proof in civil commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.932" offset="9239071">We do so largely for the reasons that I think were being suggested by Mr. Justice Stevens when he asked about the relationship between criteria and substantive burden of proof that is a substance of criteria in the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.594" offset="9293720">It seems to me as the court recognized in Patterson versus New York, only the term before last, that if you lock in a burden of proof, you in many ways limit the discretion of a State in terms of its criteria from liberalizing, from changing, from beginning to cope with new and different ways to deal with difficult and intractable problems such as mental health and involuntary commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.436" offset="9397164">Now as Mr. Hury has made claim from the State of Texas, this is not a Gault typed case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.461" offset="9417226">Texas gives civil committees a great deal of due process including a jury trail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.931" offset="9443140">In this particular case, this patient had a five day jury trail with I think as many as 12 to 14 witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.869" offset="9474800">The single question is whether one procedure should be mandated to cut across the board in all 50 states in civil commitment?</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.176" offset="9512103">Now there is the simple analogy to Winship and juvenile proceedings that appellant relies on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.860" offset="9534777">I think the analogy doesn't hold water, and I think so for the following reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.745" offset="9554317">After Gault, the juvenile proceeding was in fact formulized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.884" offset="9570931">You then had the issue of the burden of proof, that wasn't going to change the proceeding by and large that was simply going to require more evidence and protect against an erroneous conviction of a criminal charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.943" offset="9623176">However when you go to McKeever the court would not constitutionalize the jury trial requirement and it didn't do so because it was concerned that a jury trial would affect the juvenile justice system in a way perhaps that the burden of proof would not and that was because it would strip the juvenile judge of his role.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.270" offset="9696423">Now if we turn to civil commitment, I think the same thing applies when we are talking about burden of proof that is I think it's much more analogous to a jury trial requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.607" offset="9733831">And the reason I say that is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.791" offset="9742503">It seems to me unlike a juvenile delinquency determination a civil commitment spans a host of different criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.672" offset="9778030">Juvenile delinquency deals with the commission of a criminal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.070" offset="9791613">The burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is well suited to prove past acts. Civil commitment deals with a variety of things in a variety of States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.931" offset="9831111">Some of which do focus quite strongly on dangerousness and actually require as Wisconsin does proof of a passed over it act that it seems to me as a legislative decision and perhaps one that the legislature can responsibly make based on its experience, but I don't think this court should lock that process in by mandating a high burden of proof.</text>
