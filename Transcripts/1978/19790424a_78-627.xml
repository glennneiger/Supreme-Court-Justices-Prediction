            <label>Mr. David C. Greer</label>
            <text syncTime="84.356" offset="440822">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.409" offset="445001">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.548" offset="461615">I, at least, was pleased by having the respondents in the Columbus case open by asking that this Court affirm the findings of the trier of the facts, the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.999" offset="503411">And I would hope that they would open their argument in this case with the same request.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.074" offset="527653">Let me open my argument by attempting to answer in the context of Dayton a legal question and then a factual question that had been posed in the context of Columbus.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.214" offset="576240">At the time this lawsuit was filed in April of 1972, seven years ago, there were 3 -- 57 elementary schools in the Dayton school system, including the middle schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.694" offset="638098">There were no all-white elementary schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.622" offset="653876">There were three all-black.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.156" offset="664012">There were 11 high schools in the Dayton school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.978" offset="683238">None of them were all-white.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.951" offset="695150">Two of them were all-black.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.534" offset="705494">As far as teaching staffs were concerned, the teachers in the Dayton school system were integrated throughout the system on the basis of the same ratio between black and white teachers in each school as there was in the system as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.707" offset="774248">To turn from the questions posed by Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Marshall to the question posed by Mr. Justice Stevens, now which is a legal question, “Was the remedy in Swann correct?”</text>
            <text syncTime="182.857" offset="834748">Let me answer that at least in part by saying that I would stand here and say that every principle enunciated in Swann was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.335" offset="868707">Whether the remedy was correct depends upon what the facts were when that case went back to the trial court and how those facts were presented to the court and what the findings were.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.331" offset="916668">I think I stand here in a culmination of a series of decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.233" offset="940283">There has been some implication or direct indication in some of the briefs filed that we're asking the court to overrule Swann or to overrule Keyes or to overrule some prior decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.248" offset="988348">We're not.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.555" offset="993573">We are here in a case of equity that turns on particular facts and I think that's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.447" offset="1021158">And I think the principles enunciated in Dayton I grow directly from Swann and the other prior decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.982" offset="1055326">It was in Swann that this Court said that the remedial task is to correct a constitutional violation, the condition that offends the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.216" offset="1104227">It was in Swann that there was reference to the equitable powers of this Court being remedial powers, corrective powers, and that the nature of the violation is what determines the scope of a remedy in a school desegregation case or in any other equitable case.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.601" offset="1181759">In Milliken, this Court held that the remedy is necessarily designed, as all remedies are to restore the victims of discriminatory conduct to the position they would've occupied in the absence of such conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.223" offset="1244244">That, it seems to me is clearly what the incremental segregative effect standard of Dayton I is.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.640" offset="1277889">I would submit to the court that as the trial court found in this case, there was no system-wide violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.723" offset="1314252">I would also submit to the court, however, that in a case where there is a system-wide violation the equitable principles applicable to cases of this nature require a finding with respect to incremental segregative effect because the remedial purpose is a restorative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.932" offset="1395127">It's not to compare what is to what ought to be in some ideal world in which none of us can ever live.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.514" offset="1433475">It's an effort to compare what is to what would have been in the absence of violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.193" offset="1460120">And under the sharply defined standard of this Court as expressed in Dayton the remedy turns on a comparison between what is and what would've been.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.914" offset="1507035">In justifying a system-wide remedy in this case, the Sixth Circuit completely abandoned that comparative test and it redefined the whole concept of incremental segregative effect in terms of a snowballing process of cumulative violations.</text>

            <text syncTime="829.975" offset="3423274">The doctrinal problem at the violation stage of this case lies in the substitution of what I would refer to as a bed of procrustean presumptions for the judicial analysis that's contemplated by the Arlington Heights, Washington, Davis, and Dayton I decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.292" offset="3500492">If the -- if I can turn the phrase “loaded game board” to a new use, it seems to me that the series of presumptions that has been invented by the Sixth Circuit as a means for requiring system-wide racial balance is indeed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.123" offset="3575829">The way that the analysis seems to work is that whenever there is a condition of current racial imbalance in schools, which there certainly was in Dayton at the time the suit was filed, then it's fair game to go back in the past as far as may be necessary to find some constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.638" offset="3685961">And then to juxtapose the current condition of racial imbalance with a historical situation of a constitutional violation by the welding material or glue of a concept of an affirmative duty to defuse the races throughout the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.987" offset="3775300">Now that it seems to me is a far cry from the concept of the goal in the case in determining violation is to focus on the conditions that existed at the time the suit was filed and then you can look to historical background to see if those conditions were created by some constitutional misconduct on the part of the school board.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.588" offset="3889716">But you beg the question and you get into circular reasoning if you say that there is an affirmative duty to defuse races throughout a school system and therefore if that constitutional duty had been followed, why, the races would've been defused at the time the suit was filed and if they aren't defused, there must be a constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.126" offset="3971845">That I submit to you is what the Sixth Circuit has done on the violation side of this case and I think that's error.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.831" offset="4002670">And I think that's departure from the precedence and rulings of this Court and it's also a situation that if that kind of reasoning were adopted any school system in which there is existing racial balance must be subjected to a judicial remedy that provides racial balance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1015.929" offset="4167137">That principle is of course triggered by a finding of a current condition of intentional segregation in a substantial or meaningful portion of the system.</text>

            <text syncTime="2422.978" offset="9795271">The Dunbar High School which operated from 1933 to 1962, the Court of Appeals found that through discriminatory practices in other parts of the system the board, by counseling, by discriminating against black students if they went to predominantly white schools, in effect, forced blacks to go to this system-wide blacks-only high school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.298" offset="9880534">Any person who would -- who was -- observed that situation would make a residential choice on the basis of the board's policy or would likely make a residential choice on the basis of the board's segregation policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.085" offset="9931734">A white family seeking a residence in Dayton certainly would not move to the Dunbar High School area where their children couldn't even be educated because they couldn't have any contact with black teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.180" offset="9976142">At the same time, black families were not inclined to move or could not have been inclined to move into the white parts of town where they would've been subjected to humiliating discrimination and never had contact with black adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.592" offset="10105710">I want to make one other point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.559" offset="10129638">By 1969, considerable pressures were being brought to bear on the operation of the -- on the segregated operation of the Dayton public schools and on the school authorities to do something about that condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.969" offset="10183241">HEW as I said, intervened in 1969 and found that the board had a racially motivated faculty assignment policy and worked out a two-year remedy for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.066" offset="10215633">The State Board of Ohio investigated the school system at that to the State Board of Education and found that the board was under a moral and constitutional duty to take remedial action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.112" offset="10271848">The board appointed a Citizen's Committee which made similar findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.317" offset="10284596">The Board President admitted before the Citizen's Committee that the board itself had been guilty of past de jure acts of segregation -- intentional acts of segregation, I should say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.408" offset="10320959">Then the board itself considered that question in December of 1971 and adopted revolution -- resolutions admitting that its past practices had caused a current condition of segregation and directing the superintendent to develop a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.779" offset="10386474">All of these findings are -- would be entitled a probative weight in any circumstance given the normal reluctance of school officials to admit past wrongdoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.525" offset="10433494">In this case they are compelling because the facts cannot be read to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.592" offset="10481768">That remedial action of course was rescinded the following month when a new Board of Education took over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.451" offset="10525132">We think -- if I may sum up by comparing Swann to this case that the -- and in Swann, the court had -- the court recognized that the delay between 1954 and 1971, it compounded the problem, that dilatory tactics of school authorities had compounded the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.593" offset="10601723">That the court's failure to refine guidelines had compounded the problem, that the massive urban growth that had occurred through this period compounded the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.294" offset="10632547">Yet the court recognized that the school officials' persistent discriminatory conduct had played a substantial role in this pattern of development and that those findings are fully applicable to date and that remedy should be fully applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.928" offset="10691062">The judgment below should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2814.745" offset="11362304">In your quote at that page of your brief is from Oliver, it says, “The presumption of segregative purpose arises when plaintiffs established the natural probable and foreseeable result of the public official's action or inaction was an increase or perpetuation of public school segregation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2932.705" offset="11834180">This Court said in Washington versus Davis that certain patterns if they're shown to be very consistent can ultimately serve as the basis for determination of a violation not simply an inference of that violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3073.299" offset="12396544">In fact one reason why the Dayton Board of Education may not be contesting the remedy in the case is because the plan there is working well.</text>

            <text syncTime="3356.130" offset="13527855">It is Your Honor and at pages 45-50 of our brief, I have expressed the factual side of the case that relates to that remedy finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.799" offset="13582608">Either I have expressed it so well that nobody has deemed it possible to answer it or I have expressed it so poorly that nobody has deemed it necessary to answer it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.317" offset="13624613">But I would like to think that the former is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.330" offset="13640704">It seems to me that if the remedial goal is the restoration of plaintiffs to substantiate the position they would've occupied in the absence of alleged violations, it is appropriate to examine how that position is defined by the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.468" offset="13709249">And it is very sharply defined by the evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.766" offset="13726386">And I go through that evidence in quite a bit of detail in pages 45-50 of the brief and it's essentially taking black census data and taking maps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.695" offset="13774137">I am going year by year through it and here's what you find.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.094" offset="13791796">There is factual evidence in the record in this case that the center of the black population in Dayton was established not by the school board but by the 1913 Dayton flood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.281" offset="13840488">That the blacks' population following that flood located in an area on the west side of Dayton and that the population expanded from that central location with the passage of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.342" offset="13892733">Indeed, in the periods from 1951-1952 up to the time of this suit, the black student population, the Dayton school system increased from 19% to almost 45% of the students in the school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.616" offset="13949785">The evidence in this case is that the attendance boundaries in the Dayton school system have been unchanged for some 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.282" offset="13992521">There hasn't been any manipulation, any gerrymandering, any changes of any of these school boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.916" offset="14014986">And the evidence demonstrates graphically through maps and through census data that as the black population expanded from the center that it established after the 1913 flood, the schools in the Dayton system changed from white to racially-mixed to black, reflecting the residential population change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.311" offset="14116655">And it can be demonstrated year by year in a ring of schools that follows that census population that there was no change brought in these attendance boundaries or any other manner by the board to contain or to change that natural movement of population.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.803" offset="14190634">Indeed the case is a textbook because it shows the exception that proves the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.533" offset="14217488">After that flood in addition to the center of the black Dayton population being on the west side, there was a small residential area on the east side of Dayton which is a primarily white residential area along Springfield Street, in my hometown.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.441" offset="14289168">And that smaller area of black families attended these schools that were geographically close to them, Washington Elementary School and that situation has not changed over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.727" offset="14346324">And you can look at the figures for a period of 20 years and you'll find that the elementary school that serves that black neighborhood has consistently remained between 14 and 23% Black simply because it like every other school in this system has done nothing but reflect the residential racial populations served.</text>

            <text syncTime="3593.167" offset="14475995">I hate to get into the posture of making a factual argument to the Supreme Court of the United States and I don't think I need to make that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.875" offset="14510895">All I am trying to do in answer to the factual arguments that have been made here today is to express what the evidence really was and that there was a strong basis for the District Court's findings that should've been upheld.</text>

            <text syncTime="3624.136" offset="14599920">It's phrased in the findings of fact in terms of taking practice by practice, any of these isolated unconstitutional practices that may have existed historically and expressly finding that there was no incremental segregative effect from those practices at the time this suit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.820" offset="14674631">So this is part of the findings in the case and I would simply submit to you that on both the remedy and on the violation side of this case, the Dayton School Board was justified in securing a dismissal of the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="3687.498" offset="14853413">In fact from 1950 on they were all placed in white schools or I could -- but I don't think I need to go into each of those detailed factual arguments before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.939" offset="14895104">It's all in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.158" offset="14900015">It's in the judge's findings of fact and there is evidence to support it all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.687" offset="14922167">At its most fundamental level this litigation it seems to me, poses a choice, a choice between case by case application of equitable principles and judicial legislation of racial balance through the use of a loaded game board of artificial presumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.540" offset="14997504">The case also presents focus on the proper rule of intermediate Appellate Courts in this federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.867" offset="15030836">I would submit that in an attempt to justify a predetermined result, the Sixth Circuit has rewritten the legal standards that have been espoused and presented by this Court and it has rewritten the factual evidence that was presented to the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.741" offset="15106382">That is not the proper role of an intermediate Appellate Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.331" offset="15124668">If the standards established by this Court and the facts presented by the trial court are put together, they compel the following answers to the particular questions that are posed by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.100" offset="15171793">Was the Dayton school system at the time the suit was filed segregated by reasons of acts of the Dayton School Board?</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.604" offset="15253817">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.485" offset="15253713">Would the distribution of the student population in the Dayton system have been different at the time of suit if the school board had not taken the actions which the plaintiffs have challenged?</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.185" offset="15260087">That ends the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.745" offset="15270327">We are addressing the Court of Equity and I think equitable principles and the facts here compel those answers to those questions.</text>
