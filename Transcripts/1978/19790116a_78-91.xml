            <text syncTime="50.609" offset="305821">I'm Barrett Prettyman, Jr. and I represent the petitioners in this case who in turn represent a class claiming to be the true congregation of the Vineville Presbyterian Church in Macon, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.582" offset="369664">Since 1904, that church has been a member of the Augusta-Macon Presbytery which in turn is a part of the Presbyterian Church in the United States which I will call PCUS in shorthand for the purposes of this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.424" offset="453047">As this Court noted in the Hull case and as the trial court held in this case, PCUS is a hierarchal church.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.109" offset="499858">It has an ascending order of judicatories beginning with the local church session made up of the minister and its elders then proceeding up to the Presbytery which includes ministers and elders from a number of churches and then the Synod which includes a number of Presbyteries and finally, the General Assembly, the single group that is the highest court and represents all the churches under PCUS.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.271" offset="636426">Each of these bodies is called a Church Court and each has the power under the PCUS constitution to review and overrule the actions of the court below it.</text>

            <text syncTime="163.343" offset="756694">That is composed of the minister and elected elders of the local church.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.623" offset="781876">Now, each of these courts can appoint a commission to act in its place and to report to it and every member, this is important, every member who joins PCUS in any of its churches takes a vow or an oath to be bound by the PCUS structure and constitution which is principally embodied in the Book of Georgia -- Church Order which is part of the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.009" offset="899427">Back in May 1973, certain members voted at a meeting, 164 -- oh, I'm sorry, 165 to 94 to adopt the resolution separating the Vineville Presbyterian Church from the Augusta-Macon Presbytery and from PCUS and to be an independent church.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.974" offset="995244">The respondents here represent a class made up of that majority vote and my clients, the petitioners represent a class of the minority in that vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.786" offset="1046549">The majority struck the minority members' names from the roles and refused them to use -- to let them use the church property as a unit of PCUS.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.776" offset="1090435">And the majority subsequently joined the Presbyterian Church in America which is an entirely separate group totally unrelated to PCUS.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.171" offset="1132022">The majority also notified the presbytery of PCUS of their action and the minister wrote to the presbytery relinquishing his membership in the denomination.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.414" offset="1184998">I might add here that all of these facts had been stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.698" offset="1206209">The presbytery appointed a commission as it had a right to do under its constitution to investigate this situation which it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.261" offset="1252394">And the commission made three basic findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.131" offset="1271933">First, it found and declared that those members of the Vineville Presbyterian Church who held to their original vows and did not renounce their affiliation with PCUS were the true congregation of the church.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.933" offset="1347062">Secondly, they withdrew all authority from the minister and officers who agreed to the statement of withdrawal.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.244" offset="1388335">And finally, it found that the church session of the Vineville Presbyterian Church was unable to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.288" offset="1428564">It did that because that gave the power to not only make these findings but made it certain further suggestions to the Presbyterian.</text>

            <text syncTime="1339.112" offset="5459780">In the first place, your language carefully read simply doesn't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.794" offset="5482559">Secondly, such a reading would be directly contrary to what you wrote Mr. Justice in your concurrence in Abington School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.921" offset="5511084">And thirdly, and finally, such a reading simply is that it would fly squarely in the face of this Court's rulings in other cases both before in Sharpsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.877" offset="5554866">If the mother court has made a judgment and a civil court can simply ignore it and decide the case on some general principles of property law, that court has effectively overruled the church and that is precisely what this Court has repeatedly said that civil courts may not do.</text>

            <text syncTime="3174.827" offset="12802696">I understand this to be the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.788" offset="12814503">In a state such as Georgia that has adopted the neutral principles approach which is one of the three approaches that this Court has recognized as being constitutionally permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.381" offset="12864867">Where the neutral principles approach is applied by looking simply at deeds, state statutes, the corporate chart of the local church and the applicable provisions of the denomination's government and well, by using neutral principles, it found the title is in the majority that voted to withdraw as a result of the resolution of withdrawal and no religious question is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.995" offset="12959326">Nevertheless, is it requisite that a civil court differ to an ex parte administrative commission which is appointed by the denomination and which issues an ex parte finding or declaration that the property rights of the majority are forfeited under those circumstances?</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.104" offset="13039783">If I may go back more fundamentally, this case is absolutely identical with what the Maryland Court of Appeals did in the Sharpsburg situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.371" offset="13076877">Your Honors will recall that that case first came up and was then remanded in the light of Hull for further consideration in the light of what was held in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.595" offset="13117733">The Maryland Court of Appeals then wrote a second opinion in which they reviewed in great detail what have been done earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.837" offset="13146676">In short, four things were done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.207" offset="13156185">First of all, they looked at the deeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.009" offset="13163395">The deeds were identical and result to the deeds to the Georgia property in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.384" offset="13184920">Secondly, they looked at the local corporation chart which as here provided that title was held by the local congregation and it had the right to buy and sell and so forth the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.510" offset="13233403">Third, they looked at state statutes which just as here did not give any rights to the denomination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.549" offset="13257540">And finally, they looked to the Book of Church Government of the Church of God and just as here, just as the Book of Church Order, they found nothing that gave any rights other than to the local congregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.750" offset="13310412">So applying the neutral principles of law which this Court has recognized can be applied if it doesn't involve going into questions of doctrine in Hull again using one of the three constitutionally permissible methods that Mr. Justice Brennan singled out in his concurring opinion in Sharpsburg in which this Court unanimously in Sharpsburg upheld in the case of the Maryland situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3391.473" offset="13669230">Well, that's precisely what the Book of Church Order does in the present case as to local church property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.406" offset="13692949">It says that local church property shall be subject to the sole and exclusive power of the local congregation and that is identical to the Church of God situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.377" offset="13732864">It meant in short that neither the presbytery or the Synod nor the General Assembly nor any commission or committee of any of them had any claim of any kind to local church property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.202" offset="13776227">I would say in conclusion, may it please the Court that we feel that this is simply a local church property dispute in which the neutral principles of law or doctrine has been properly applied by this -- by the Supreme Court of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.809" offset="13830562">Whereas in Carnes versus Smith the denomination prevailed because it had in its discipline appropriate provisions with respect to local church property.</text>

            <text syncTime="3546.296" offset="14288541">And that the denomination has only the right to recognize the minority as being true as far as membership is concerned but not with respect to property rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.268" offset="14324485">Property rights are determined by what was in the Book of Church Order on the date that the schism took place.</text>

            <text syncTime="3583.036" offset="14435558">First, my opponent has said that there is no question of religion raised by the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.694" offset="14458128">I would simply call your attention to the complaint which was based squarely, totally, completely on this church ruling as to who the congregation was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.434" offset="14497102">Secondly, I agree with the thrust that some of the questions that we really probably shouldn't be arguing about in an interpretation of the Book of Church Order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.422" offset="14529076">It's not for us to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="3654.089" offset="14719770">I agree that they could have sold it but the money would have been held in trust for the congregation of the church as determined by the mother church when the mother church reviewed that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.980" offset="14763342">I doubt if they could have gotten title back because you have a third innocent party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.757" offset="14782360">But -- but there's no question about that, the money would have been held subject to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.716" offset="14806288">And when the presbytery came around if they said if that property should not have been sold, that was not in the best interest of the church, they could have sought -- said where that money should have gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.899" offset="14846934">My last point is in regard to Sharpsburg, it's very interesting that Maryland at that time had a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.486" offset="14885282">Remember that that was a congregational case but Maryland had a statute which said such Presbyterian Churches, and we're now referring to the Presbyterian Church in United States maybe incorporated only in conformity with the provisions of the Constitution of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.442" offset="14957171">In other words, Maryland recognize even the Sharpsburg situation that you had a different situation from the Church of God than you did in the Presbyterian Church which was hierarchical in nature.</text>
