            <text syncTime="159.646" offset="741961">No, Mr. Justice Powell, we do not take that position, the Crest Finance case, which we distinguish here may clear that when a lien -- when the amount of a lien is evidenced by notes, notes bearing face values, that lien is choate as the government conceded and as the Court held in that case, even though it was not reduced to judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.291" offset="840495">Thus if the future advances that Kimbell made in this case, the future advances had been evidenced by notes as where the inventory advances that Kimbell made in 1966 and 1968, this would then be a different case and Kimbell then would have a choate lien with respect to those future advances.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.548" offset="945612">But the future advances here were not evidenced by notes that the lien does not have to be reduced to judgment when it is this kind of a lien, but there is a significant -- a crucial difference between having a dead evidence by notes and having a simply be an open account where the amount is indicated perhaps in one amount on the sellers books and another amount on the purposes books where there are all sorts of uncertainties and possible differences with respect to the amount that are not ironed out until there is a judgment.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="387.470" offset="1653217">Mr. Barnett, at what way does that argument cut?</text>
            <text syncTime="389.820" offset="1662621">What you are saying I suppose is the government is willing to take greater risks in lending than private lenders do.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.844" offset="1686758">So, why should have then the greater protection?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Stephen R. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="398.951" offset="1699192">Well, it takes greater risks but it needs protection that is consonant with those risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.781" offset="1726464">This Court in the area of tax liens decided bringing the rule over from the Insolvency Statute that the government needed the kind of protection reflected in the first in time, first in right rule as adumbrated by the choateness principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.159" offset="1788008">We submit that unless Congress says otherwise, it is appropriate to give the government the same protection here, a dollar coming in on recovery of an SBA lien is the same to the government as a dollar collected on taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.900" offset="1842970">In fact, Congress replenishes the amount that the SBA loses, this is not in the record but Congress as in every year, since the establishment of the SBA as I understand it, appropriated at least enough to cover the amount that the SBA lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.719" offset="1914232">So that if the SBA does not recover on its security and it does in fact take security for almost virtually all its loans, Congress ends up appropriating that money.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="463.124" offset="1955819">Yes, but it takes security that would not be sufficient to induce a commercial lender to advance the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.599" offset="1981733">So, then just it starts from the promise that it is willing to take some additional risks.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen R. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="474.335" offset="2000750">That is true and the question here is you are correct to what extent that would justify imposing on the government, this Court imposing on the government when Congress has not done so risks greater than had been imposed on the government in the context of federal tax liens.</text>

            <text syncTime="519.857" offset="2182771">But here before they advance the money, they cant go out, make a title research like any other lender can.</text>

            <text syncTime="1696.879" offset="6890872">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.665" offset="6906023">Well, it may not have seen readily apparent from the government's abbreviated statement of the issue presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.288" offset="6940505">This isn't simply a case of a choate federal lien versus an inchoate private lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.579" offset="6973733">This case is entirely different from any other cases on which the government relies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.797" offset="6994526">The two competing liens that you have in this case were both created and perfected under the uniform commercial code of the State of Texas in favor of private lenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.824" offset="7046666">This wasn't a government lien from the inception, one lien the first lien was created in favor of Kimbell Foods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.909" offset="7074983">It was perfected in 1966 and 1968 long before, the second party Republic National Bank acquired its security interest much less had it perfected and at least two years prior to the time that the SBA purchased an undivided 90% interest.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="1763.601" offset="7157739">Are you arguing, Mr. Teofan that if Texas was the only state that had this code and the other 49 states had a different uniform code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.525" offset="7201520">The case would be the same?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="vernon_o_teofan" startTime="1775.690" stopTime="1984.335">
            <label>Mr. Vernon O. Teofan</label>
            <text syncTime="1775.690" offset="7206118">Yes, based on United States versus Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.634" offset="7237883">What the SBA is arguing in this case is that in 1961 five years after Kimbell perfected its lien when it purchased its 90% interest in the Republic National Bank security interest that invested that Republic National Bank security interest with federal lien rights and sovereign prerogatives, which related all the way back to when the lien was first taken by the Republic National Bank and by applying the choateness test at that point in time bootstraps the Republic National Bank security interest into a first position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.598" offset="7377795">The Fifth Circuit rejected that logic and refused to extend the choate lien test into this kind of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.049" offset="7407574">Now, when I was reviewing this Court's opinions in United States versus City of New Britain and United States versus Vermont, I realized that I had missed a very basic point in briefing the situation for Kimbell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.158" offset="7476015">In United States versus City of New Britain, in that case you had competing local water rent liens and local tax liens competing with the federal tax lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.271" offset="7524498">The Court there laid down the basic rule that in determining what is first in time and therefore first in right you must determine which lien attached first and which lien became choate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.742" offset="7578311">It didn't say that that test only applied to the private lien and not the government lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.301" offset="7600567">So, then you come to the United States versus Vermont, unanimous decision by this Court, the opinion written by Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.508" offset="7633377">In that case, the two liens you had competing with each other was a federal tax lien and a Vermont tax lien, which arose under a statute that was patterned after the federal tax lien and whose reading was identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.189" offset="7696175">The Vermont tax lien had been assisted first, the federal lien some months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.219" offset="7716237">The government in that case argued that the Vermont lien was inchoate and urged that a different standard of choateness be applied to the state lien than to the government lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.312" offset="7760645">Will this Court rejected that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.765" offset="7766392">Both liens rose under identical statutes and this Court held the Vermont lien first in time and prior in right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.143" offset="7803904">The basis of the Vermont case essentially is this; when you have two competing liens, which arise under the same statute such as we have here are substantially identical statutes, the reasonable rule is to look to the statute for priority and that's uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.861" offset="7890840">I submit that this Court can dispose off this case in favor of Kimbell just by reiterating that the federal common law rule is that with the liens arise under the same statute are under substantially identical statutes, you look to the statue for priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.768" offset="7962415">That's uniform, that's non-discriminatory and unquestionably just.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.411" offset="7993031">That point is not specifically covered in that brief and neither is the point was in relation to some subsequent congressional action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2320.205" offset="9384208">Note 35 is the financial assistance manual of the Small Business Administration, SBA 500 is replete with admonitions to follow state law carefully.</text>

            <text syncTime="2428.896" offset="9818990">And therefore urges this Court to not deviate from that rule but extend it into this new field of consensual security interest under Uniform Commercial Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.171" offset="9868100">First of all, such contention is not well taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.121" offset="9879907">There exists no such coherent, well-established, well-understood body of president.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.928" offset="9903104">This court has never extended the choate lien test rule outside the context of the federal Insolvency Statute or the federal Tax Lien Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.173" offset="9944064">In both of those fields, Congress has greatly reduced federal priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.632" offset="9977919">This Court has never held in any case that the choate lien test applies to a consensual security interest held or acquired by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.187" offset="10024103">Neither this Court or any lower court has ever held a choateness test that applicable in a case involving a federal consensual lien versus a private consensual lien, a federal security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code versus a private security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.785" offset="10098500">There has been no extension of that choate lien test into this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.896" offset="10118980">Consequently, there is no evil for the government to correct by legislation, they are just this field has not been covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.174" offset="10160044">The Five Circuit Court of Appeals cases relied on by the government is establishing this president at the time the transactions were entered into, all involve a competing statutory special interest lien created by a state statute, which either grants that lien super priority or relates it back to a point in time that has no reasonable connection with the establishment of the lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.316" offset="10284596">We don't have that in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.168" offset="10300061">The choateness rule was developed primarily to prevent the special interest lien creditors from getting their leg up on the government in the collecting of its taxes in the exercise of a sovereign power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.403" offset="10357008">Now what the government is trying to do in this case is to take the choate lien test and relate it back and give the government a leg up on the private lender and it's not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.557" offset="10405595">What they are attempting to do is to perpetrate a reverse evil that the choateness rule was originally fashioned by this Court to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.983" offset="10463274">Such coherent, well-established body of president was not even well understood by the attorneys and the representatives of the government and the SBA at the beginning of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.161" offset="10520012">And the government's answer to Kimbell's complaint and then the detailed pre-trial agreement that was filed with the Court absolutely no mention whatsoever is made of choateness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.840" offset="10566719">No issue is reserved as to whether or not Kimbell's lien is choate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.527" offset="10593468">During the trial with this case counsel for the government stood up and announced to the trail court that its position was the same as the Republic National Banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.138" offset="10635891">The primary line of defense had nothing to do with choateness or federal super priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.663" offset="10662013">It was one Kimbell had either expressly or implyably agreed that its lien would be inferior to the lien of the Republic National Bank or number two that under applicable state law, future advances were not covered under the security agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.074" offset="10723662">That was rejected by the Fifth Circuit, is not here before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.500" offset="10737351">It was not until after the case was actually tried and briefs were submitted to trail court that the issue of choateness was ever raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.902" offset="10770996">So, if it was such a well established, well understood body of president, why did it appear in the case so late?</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.055" offset="10803597">I think the law review articles that had been written by the authorities with relation to the choateness rule demonstrate that it is not a clear body of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.746" offset="10838392">Even counsel in this case is somewhat unclear as to what is or is not a choate lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.766" offset="10870471">In the original brief, he took the position that Kimbell's lien could not be choate because it was not reduced to judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2754.779" offset="11122500">Even the government doesn't know when a lien is choate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.414" offset="11140995">They say, there is a big difference between a security interest that secures a debt owing on a promissory note, which it now says it maybe choate because of its concession made into the Crest Finance case but that doesn't apply where the debt is secured by an open account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.933" offset="11211107">It says if you have got a piece of paper that says it's a promissory note that's good it's choate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.894" offset="11230960">If your pieces of paper are invoices submitted on a weekly basis plus statements of account, they say that's not good, that's inchoate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.259" offset="11260426">And why do they say that, they say that because there are many challenges that a creditor who purchases goods on open account can make and therefore there are many contingencies and until it's reduced to judgment, it can't be choate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.755" offset="11326360">But that's what a specious reasoning, the same applies to a promissory note in the Crest case, you had a series of promissory notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.453" offset="11365230">Payments have been made on those notes, additional interest had accrued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.913" offset="11391039">The debt secured was not the face of the promissory note, you had to go to the books and records of the government and you had to go to the books and records of the finance company to determine what the balance outstanding was on any given day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.131" offset="11455927">And anybody who has tried a case on a promissory note knows that ingenious counsel can come up with as many defenses to suite for the balance of a promissory note as he can for a suite based on an account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.016" offset="11511411">So, if a suite we submit Your Honor that if a security interest securing the balance on promissory notes is not choate so also should be held for the purpose of choateness in this area if it applies is the balance owing on an open account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.250" offset="11576404">Even t any given point in time, you can determine the amount of the lien, the property to which it attaches the name of the secured party and the name of the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.838" offset="11622693">The other point with relation to security interest under the code is that some of the cases that indicated that a lien will be "if it's enforceable by summary proceedings, it is to be noted under the Uniform Commercial Code that upon default, a security interest can be enforced by summary proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.163" offset="11696044">The creditor goes up, picks up the property and sells it, no judicial action is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.637" offset="11749961">The government argues that what we really need to do here is take a rule that will give us this stability and certainty so that people who are engaged in commercial lending will know where they stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.479" offset="11813282">And they say that we can get that way through the choate lien test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.938" offset="11831150">Now we submit that is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.787" offset="11842539">If you take their argument that a lien becomes -- that a private lien becomes a federal lien when it's acquired by the government and it relates all the way back to when it was first created and then you will apply the choateness test there, which you have is uncertainty foretold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.358" offset="11908786">First of all, the man who makes a loan or who is extending credit, first he will not know if the government will ever come in and guarantee a loan, insure a loan or buy somebody's loan or get a direct loan sometime in the future three or four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.664" offset="11982033">If the government does come in and acquire a loan some years in advance then that creditor will not know to what date that lien relates back because there is absolutely nothing that requires the recordation of a government guarantee or a government security interest even after the government acquires it, nothing need really be filed off record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.221" offset="12088299">And as far as the commercial community is concerned, there is absolutely no notice to anybody that there maybe a federal lien floating out there somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.372" offset="12128841">The other uncertainty, the third uncertainty is to what collateral will a federal lien attach when it relates back?</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.123" offset="12159875">Property is sold, a lot of people have shipped in additional merchandize to the debtor like Kimbell did in this case, Kimbell's security interest is a purchase money security interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.319" offset="12196655">It secures the payment price of merchandize, which Kimbell actually shipped in, if the lien relates back prior to that time and Kimbell's lien is no good that's an uncertainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.710" offset="12250258">And the other uncertainty would be the amount of the debt that would be secured at the time the federal lien was given effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.723" offset="12278262">The amounts balance if the loan was originally $300,000 it could be down to 20, if it were originally 300 and it had future advances, clauses that could go up to 600.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.570" offset="12321625">Too much uncertainty would be created by applying the choateness rule in this concept of consensual liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.826" offset="12358719">The performance of a proprietary or a commercial function by the government is distinguished from a sovereign function such as collecting taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.509" offset="12397380">You just wouldn't know where you stood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.941" offset="12407097">Now, they make an argument in their brief that, this will not create any economic adverse effects on private loans to small businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.546" offset="12461537">Now, common sense and experience tells every one of us that whether you are loaning money or selling product, if a private lender sells to a specific portion of a market and loses money, one or two things is going to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.727" offset="12526320">He is either going to increase the cost of that service to the customer or he is going to curtail doing business in that segment of the economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.234" offset="12608345">The government has intimated that if this Court were to adopt the priority rules that have been incorporated by Congress in the Tax Lien Act of 1966 that Kimbell would lose because the advances were made more than 45 days after the federal lien, well, that argument is based on the premises that the federal lien was filed when it was originally filed in favor of Republic National Bank.</text>

            <text syncTime="3723.034" offset="14995519">The federal government this time through the Farmers' Home Administration of the Department of Agriculture had a lien in the tractor as security for loans it made to the farmer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.164" offset="15048077">After this lien had been established, the farmer took the tractor to respondent for repairs and the question is whether respondent statutory repairman's lien takes precedence over the earlier federal lien under principles of super priority or on the other hand whether the government's lien prevails under the principle of first in time, first in right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.874" offset="15162911">The FHA makes loans pursuing to what is now the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to farmers, who are unable to obtain sufficient credit elsewhere to finance their actual needs at reasonable rates in terms.</text>

            <text syncTime="3854.491" offset="15521311">This was apparently quite a tractor in this case because between November 1972 and July 1973, the farmer brought it into respondent for repairs a total of seven times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.027" offset="15579512">In each case respondent made the repairs and returned the tractor to the farmer, who did not pay his bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.656" offset="15605948">By July of 1973 the amount of the bill was $1,600.</text>
            <text syncTime="3881.011" offset="15627368">When the respondent brought the tractor and again for the eighth time in December 1973 this time for repairs that raise the account to $2100, the respondent kept possession of the tractor while awaiting payment.</text>

            <text syncTime="4035.790" offset="16246575">Well, we take the position that Georgia law is that the District Court was wrong that under Georgia law there is no such super priority here but it's not a position we rely on, it's not a question of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4054.803" offset="16322539">But to answer the broader implications of your question Mr. Justice Rehnquist if the Court here were to take the position that state law governs we think it would have all, we think there would be all sorts of problems with that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4074.534" offset="16401533">For one thing, it would destroy the uniformity, which we insist that this Court has recognized beginning with the Clearfield Trust case, in Clearfield Trust and the Court here recognized that the Fifth Circuit here relied on Kimbell and in its earlier Hicks case, the Fifth Circuit in stating that federal law governs stated the principle reason supporting the application of federal law is a need for uniform rule of decision to govern the rights of the United States and the administration of a large scale program.</text>
            <text syncTime="4115.450" offset="16565164">Now that need for uniformity would be particularly destroyed in a situation of this case where the states are quite split on the question of super priority for repairmen's liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4128.481" offset="16617305">As we note in our brief page 27 no 24 there are at least 13 states that have been held to have statutes, which deny the repairmen the super priority those are 13th cited cases, I am sorry, to find the 13, the ALR annotation cited their list ten and our citations include three more.</text>
            <text syncTime="4152.223" offset="16712286">Those are cases that have held that states have such statues, there may be other states that do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.439" offset="16733080">Thus they would be quite a divergence in what the rule is under state law and recent method this would make it quite difficult for federal agencies to administer their programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4167.493" offset="16773308">Now the Yazell case, which has been cited in opposition to this principle, was a case involving a state law of Marital property and while the Court there followed that law, there is a statement in the opinion saying that if the SBA regulations worked to the contrary, the result might be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4188.318" offset="16856691">The SBA regulations now are to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4191.667" offset="16870066">We submitted that case is very far from questions of commercial law as are involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4198.492" offset="16897337">In Little Lake Misere as well this Court pointed out that the land acquisition there although it was an acquisition of land, the kind of thing traditionally governed by local law, quote is, when arising from and bearing heavily upon a federal regulatory program.</text>
            <text syncTime="4215.560" offset="16965569">Choice of law is therefore a federal decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4218.586" offset="16977690">In Miree versus DeKalb County, in applying state law, the Court said the question here does not require decision under federal common law since the litigation is among private parties and no substantial rights or duties of the US hinge on the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="4236.308" offset="17048639">Well, in this case substantial rights and duties of the US do hinge on the outcome, the litigation is not between private parties but the United States is involved and we submit that not only does Clearfield Trust apply but the principle of uniformity that's imbibed in Clearfield Trust would be inconsistent with borrowing or adopting state law as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="4470.086" offset="17983718">In particular the Second Circuit in the MacArthur Village case noted one such exception in the Tax Lien Act 26 U.S.C. 6323(b)(7) which applies to mechanics liens for the repair or improvement of a personnel residence containing not more than four dwelling units, occupied by the owner of such residence but only if the contract price is not more than $1000.</text>

            <text syncTime="4515.159" offset="18163963">Would the Court here gives super priority to the that kind of lien even though the Tax Lien Act would not, would it give super priority only up to the amount of a $1000, would it incorporate to a limited of only four dwelling units in the residence.</text>

            <text syncTime="4948.343" offset="19896717">We think there are several reasons why that argument should not be accepted, one is it significant that it has not been accepted in a number of states at least 13, the equity that is so clear to respondent is apparently not so clear to legislatures in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4963.787" offset="19958471">In addition it should be noted that in reality we are not the first in time rule does not mean that the first lienor has an unchangeable primacy, it simply sets a starting point from which the parties made deal, a clear starting point.</text>

            <text syncTime="5227.391" offset="21012982">The broad impact of this case is reflected in the amicus briefs filed both in this case and in the Kimbell case but the impact is broader than that because the individuals with the federal loan programs would design to protect and to benefit or the indirect are going to be affected by the decision of this Court if it overrules the Fifth Circuit and this is true because the utilization of the first in time choate lien doctrines ultimately creates a situation where a lender or where a mechanic will not be with one who has previously always going to deal with the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5272.563" offset="21193644">Apparently the government has abandoned the choate lien concept in the context of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.880" offset="21222902">In their brief they utilized the Kimbell argument as their first argument and I gather today the counsel is admitted to the Court that choateness is not a concept or not a doctrine this Court may consider in determining whether or not to extend or amplify the first in time rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="5301.871" offset="21310882">However the first in time rule incorporates and embraces the concept of choateness, so it's somewhat difficult to separate too.</text>
            <text syncTime="5311.718" offset="21350275">The question is whether to expand a rule that was developed in the context of tax lien statute and the insolvency statute into a commercial arena.</text>

            <text syncTime="5437.917" offset="21855065">No this Court can affirm the Fifth Circuit court by adopting the federal common law rule based upon the Uniform Commercial Code that the Fifth Circuit adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5447.902" offset="21894980">You start from the proposition as the Court has suggested that it will that federal law must pertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="5454.196" offset="21920162">Then the next question is what law of what will be the rule of law has been suggested that you can go directly to state law and so we will apply state law period or we will fashion a federal rule based upon something, whether the state law or in the case of the Fifth Circuit upon the Model Uniform Commercial Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="5476.361" offset="22008769">The rule so fashioned at least does this, it is a commercial rule that was designed and developed for using a commercial transaction, it is not a rule that was designed to determine tax priorities and it is a rule that composed with 1962 instead of late 1800s, it's a recent rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="5500.485" offset="22105318">The other aspect of utilizing a federal common law rule based upon the Uniform Commercial Code as we have indicated a little earlier and as the Court has become a way of respect to SBA and FHA the regulations in sales direct the lending offices and direct the agencies to utilize and incorporate and take advantage of and consider local law and local enterprise, when determining how to transact their business on a local level on the Uniform Commercial Code, does embrace a concept of locality the very same law, which the government relied upon in this case to a originally perfected security interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5547.113" offset="22291832">This Court has never applied the first in time rule of any area of commerce, it's been restricted to the Tax Lien area and the insolvency statute though the government is prevailed upon some of the lower courts to extend and amplify that doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="5565.581" offset="22365706">No statutory basis at all for extending the doctrine and again the FHA regulations rely to the point that the federal government makes in its brief, they contend that the first in time rule is a uniform universal rule and that there are no exceptions.</text>

            <text syncTime="6142.823" offset="24674617">Importance of this is that the government turns to statute and state law and tax law to determine that it may or may not as it chooses to do so have a priority over purchase money security interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="7050.662" offset="28306056">The question has been suggested that the Clearfield Trust case and the policies inherent in it perhaps need reconsideration by the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="7086.210" offset="28448162">I know that it hasn't been suggested that Clearfield Trust be reconsidered with the spect of the question of whether it's a decision of federal law or not, but we would submit that if state law is to borrowed on a wholesale basis that implicates the policies embodied in the Clearfield Trust decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="7104.399" offset="28520991">We submit that the main policy embodied there is uniformity and if state law is to be borrowed on a wholesale basis, one is going to encounter on certainty, sacrifices of the federal interest and perhaps even more uncertainty than one would have if one decided that it was a state question in the first place.</text>
