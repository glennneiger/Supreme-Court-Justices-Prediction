            <text syncTime="81.563" offset="430665">I would like to reserve approximately 10 minutes of my time, if I might, at the end for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.131" offset="460967">The issue here before this Court is whether this Court is going to extend its holding in United States versus Chadwick so as to prevent law officers who are in the process of conducting a valid automobile exception search from searching luggage which is found within the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.449" offset="562218">Now, it appears to me that, from the facts here, there are -- there is no question but that what we have here is an automobile search.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.077" offset="600670">Digressing a little bit, this Court has held in Carol, in Chadwick, and in other cases that it will recognize an exemption to the Fourth Amendment Warrant Clause where there is probable cause to believe a vehicle contains contraband and it is coupled or the situation is coupled with exigent circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="157.013" offset="732432">Mr. Justice, I think we're clearly talking apples and oranges and I think, in Chadwick, this Court made it extremely plain, mentioning several times, that it did not deal with nor was it confronted with an automobile exception search.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.076" offset="792722">The automobile exception in Chadwick was not raised in the Court of Appeal, nor was it brought before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.363" offset="825846">What you had there was a situation where the officers had made the arrest and had seized a 200-pound double-lock footlocker which was about to be placed into the trunk of a parked car with its engine not running with the trunk open.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.545" offset="894600">But, the search did not take place there.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.587" offset="910796">It was after the officers reduced both the defendant and the footlocker to their exclusive control and took both to the federal building in Boston where they kept them for an hour-and-a half before doing the search that led this Court, I believe, to say, in no stretch of the imagination, “can we see exigent circumstances?”</text>
            <text syncTime="222.601" offset="994806">Here, on the other hand, we are faced with a search -- we are faced, first of all, with a defendant and a confederate whose existence the officers did not know until they saw him meet up at the baggage area of the airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.314" offset="1065650">These individuals leave the baggage area of the Little Rock Airport, which incidentally is immediately adjacent to the door where the cabs are.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.045" offset="1100549">They im -- leave the baggage area.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.334" offset="1113715">They climb into a taxicab which is moving down one of the busiest there affairs in town, away from the airport at 5:00 in rush hour traffic on Friday afternoon after the Courts have closed for the weekend to some point unknown.</text>

            <text syncTime="2581.293" offset="10429607">It would seem to me that that analysis was abandoned in Chadwick in a footnote to the opinion written by Mr. Chief Justice Burger, in which he points out that there is a distinction between the proprietary property interest in the object, be it a car or a suitcase, which is not -- which is something entirely different from the individual's privacy expectation in the contents thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.024" offset="10540471">Certainly, as was stated in Chadwick, the far greater intrusion is into the suitcase, not the mere seizure of it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph H. Purvis</label>
            <text syncTime="3376.928" offset="13612157">Just a very few remarks, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.807" offset="13631592">First, contrary to Mr. Lassiter, I think, again, let me reiterate, what we have here is not necessary an arrest prior to seizure and all of this, but we have one rather rapid smooth-flowing set of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.721" offset="13699302">And, it seems clear, to me at least, that the search of the suitcase was clearly justifiable under the automobile exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.665" offset="13731067">In fact, it was part -- in partial and didn't constitute the search of the automobile itself to hold that there were no exigent circumstances present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.067" offset="13780699">Merely when the officer stopped them would be, number one, it seems to me, to deny the smooth-flowing facts of the case and of the search which was highly contemporaneous to the stopping and, two, to say that they had evaporated in that sort of situation makes it rather impossible to have exigent circumstances present in any situation where you've stopped any automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.107" offset="13880801">We use the rather farfetched analogy in our brief that, in order to follow this particular logic, you would have to have someone make a John Wayne style leap from one moving vehicle into another, and to conduct the search while the vehicle was still moving and I don't think that this Court, nor any Court, nor any human being with a whit of common sense would say that that would be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.828" offset="13975677">It goes simply to the point that exigent circumstances, once present, don't -- do not quickly evaporate merely because the police have stopped the individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="3503.121" offset="14116843">The common carrier might be a taxi which you have commandeered exclusively or you might share it with 2 other passengers, or it might be a bus in which you share it with 50 or 100.</text>

          <turn speaker="joseph_h_purvis" startTime="3515.070" stopTime="3704.034">
            <label>Mr. Joseph H. Purvis</label>
            <text syncTime="3515.070" offset="14164699">I think that, of all the common carriers of which I know, that the taxicab probably is intended to be a repository of the fewer number of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.109" offset="14204824">You generally have anywhere from one to four people who obtain a taxicab as opposed to an airplane or a bus where you may have 50, 60, or hundreds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.793" offset="14243589">And, it seems also to me that if you say, as Mr. Lassiter does, well, you can conduct a valid search of this automobile but you can't -- or seizure of the suitcase but you can't do a search because of the privacy right, then you're saying that, given a diminished expectation of privacy in the vehicle, that you are going to place then your truck entirely on the place or the thing in which that alleged privacy right was focused, namely a suitcase or a piece of luggage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.850" offset="14375769">And, I think it's the right of privacy overall and I think, given one who is an automobile, it is expectation of privacy over the contents of the automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.443" offset="14414117">His possession is in the automobile that are reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.313" offset="14437627">Also, going back too, I think you get -- you are confronted again, if you follow Mr. Lassiter's logic, with the definition of “what is luggage?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.168" offset="14477019">And I would agree with Jack that one of the primary focuses is to come to some sort of predictability because all law enforcement people would like this and people on both sides of the fence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.542" offset="14526548">And, it seems to me that if you say that we are going to create an exemption of the automobile exception or carve out an exception within him for luggage or repositories of private effects that you are engaging in a never ending battle, a never ending definition because what may be trash to me might be someone else's luggage and you can battle this out forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.000" offset="14656428">Finally, I think, too, the one key thing to remember is the question that needs to be answered here was, “was this search of the suitcase reasonable under the circumstances?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.412" offset="14702090">And, given the exigent circumstances which I had previously stated, which I've earnestly feel existed that justified the stopping, I think -- with the expectation of privacy, I think it was only reasonable for those officers to open up that suitcase and look inside it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.404" offset="14773979">Had they found nothing, obviously, Mr. Sanders and his defendant would have been allowed to go on their way and I think it is exactly this situation that this Court referred to in its opinion in Chambers that, given the valid auto exception, there is no constitutional difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.953" offset="14844197">In fact, it may very well be, the Court held implicitly, a lesser intrusion of the right of privacy to allow that immediate warrantless search on the scene as opposed to taking the individuals back and waiting several hours upon the obtaining of a warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3720.763" offset="14987452">Which, leads to another problem too, and that is consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.610" offset="15006887">It is very easy to say “well, he could have consented to it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.035" offset="15020575">However, I'm sure Mr. Lassiter, as a trial lawyer, very well knows the problem of consent at the time of the search and proving consent at the time of trial or at the appellate level are two different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.565" offset="15078672">Very often, the Arkansas Supreme Court has rejected twice in the past three weeks consent searches where there was testimony of two officers and, indeed, a consent form signed where the lower Court found that there was valid consent, and the Arkansas Court held, well, because it was a situation where there were three officers in uniform with guns and one defendant or two defendants, there was the natural coercion there and we just cannot believe that this was a valid consent.</text>
