            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="8.874" offset="35422">This case is here by reason of the grant of certiorari to the review of the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey Appellate Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.844" offset="83278">The case involves the scope of the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination grounded in the Fifth Amendment and made binding against the States by the Fourteenth.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.403" offset="129567">The precise question is whether despite this constitutional privilege, a prosecutor may use a person’s immunized grand jury testimony to impeach that person’s credibility as a testifying defendant in a criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.804" offset="199158">The New Jersey Appellate Court held that the grand jury testimony could not be use for that purpose and reversed the criminal conviction of the respondent for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.024" offset="244088">We affirmed the judgment of the New Jersey Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.947" offset="259762">Testimony given in response to a grant of a legislative immunity is the essence of coerced testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.530" offset="294034">The witness is told to talk or face the Government’s coercive sanctions, notably a conviction for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.109" offset="328411">The information given and response to a grant of immunity may well be more reliable than information beaten from a helpless defendant in a station house, but it is no less compelled. And the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments provide a privilege against compel self-incrimination not merely against unreliable self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.451" offset="429767">We thus still here with the constitutional privilege against compulsory self-incrimination in its most pristine form.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.332" offset="465293">The courts are not free therefore in a case like this to engage in a process of balancing the competitive interests involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.882" offset="503432">Any such balancing was performed finally and forever or at least until the constitution is amended by our forefathers.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.502" offset="545959">For these reasons more fully elaborated in the written opinion filed this morning with the clerk, the judgment of the New Jersey Court is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.673" offset="586606">Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Powell while both joining the opinion of the Court have each written concurring opinions which respectively have been joined by Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.425" offset="645642">Mr. Justice Blackmun on the other hand has filed a dissenting opinion which the Chief Justice has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.448" offset="673750">This dissenting opinion I should add does not reach the substantive constitutional question decided today.</text>
