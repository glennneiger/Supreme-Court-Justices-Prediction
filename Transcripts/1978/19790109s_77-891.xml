            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="10.868" offset="43468">Well, this appeal comes to us from the United States District Court for the Eastern District Court of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.767" offset="71053">It is still yet another in the series of cases relating to state regulation of abortion procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.846" offset="103340">At issue here is the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1974 which is enacted over the governor's veto in the year following this Court's decisions in Roe against Wade and Doe against Bolton.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.335" offset="157257">Section 5 (a) of that Act requires every person who performs an abortion to make a determination based on his experience, judgment, or professional competence that the fetus is not viable if he determines that the fetus is viable or the statute reads if there is sufficient reason to believe that the fetus may be viable then he must exercise the same care to preserve the life and health of the fetus as would be required in the case of one intended to be born alive.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.449" offset="289750">He must also use the abortion technique providing the best opportunity for the fetus to be born alive so long as a different technique is not necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.990" offset="335935">Section 5 (d) imposes a criminal sanction for a violation of the foregoing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.131" offset="360490">The present suit was instituted by the appellees, a licensed physician and certain organizations against Pennsylvania officials challenging the statute on constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.620" offset="406465">A three-judge Federal District Court among other things held that Section 5 (a) was unconstitutionally vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.267" offset="436976">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reaffirm that ruling and hold that the viability determination requirement is void for vagueness and that the standard of care provision is likewise impermissibly vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.154" offset="492565">I'm authorized to say that Mr. Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion and joined therein by the Chief Justice and by Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
