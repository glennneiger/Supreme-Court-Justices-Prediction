            <label>Mr. Bernard A. Berkman</label>
            <text syncTime="78.056" offset="415640">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.019" offset="431417">There are a multitude of reasons why the search and seizures in this case are constitutionally tainted.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.497" offset="461406">Any one of them ought to be sufficient to require the reversal of the conviction below.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.023" offset="491499">First of all, the warrant under which the search was conducted was invalid both because it was issued without probable cause and because it failed to identify with particularity the items which were to be seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.579" offset="549700">Second of all, the search was an exploratory, limitless, general search.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.279" offset="576449">Third, the magistrate failed to focus searchingly on the obscenity of the seized items before seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.967" offset="607274">And fourth, because the seizure was so general so pervasive, so massive, it affected a restraint which required an adversary hearing on the question of obscenity in advance of seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.712" offset="662235">We contend that the presence of the magistrate on the premises not only failed to cure the constitutional violations but actually intensified them and we urge that the Fourth Amendment protects the petitioner against the general search and mass seizure which took place here.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="156.725" offset="730258">Well, if you say that the presence of the magistrate on the premises didn't even nil, it didn't cure the problems to which you've alluded but actually intensified them.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.409" offset="781040">How -- how would the state go about handling the service situation?</text>

            <label>Mr. Bernard A. Berkman</label>
            <text syncTime="178.714" offset="818239">Well, it would seem to me that the entry onto the premises assuming no further rights than any customer might have the purchase or the observation of material which would not involve the authorization of an invalid warrant to search and to seize and without the massive seizure that took place here.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.720" offset="898278">It might be an acceptable way of dealing with the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.217" offset="912280">Heller, I think demonstrates a manner in which this Court has held the seizure of material after a careful focusing upon the entirety of the materials involved was done and handled apparently properly --</text>

            <text syncTime="219.144" offset="979989">Are you suggesting that the proper procedure was for the officer, for an officer not a judge but an officer to go on the premises of the store and buy selective pieces of material, books and films than take them back, show them to the magistrate or the judge as the basis for getting a warrant at a later point?</text>

            <text syncTime="258.757" offset="1138395">And it seems to me there are a number of other ways in which a criminal prosecution might originated.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.042" offset="1155532">It might be that some citizen might make a purchase which he regards to be inappropriate and seeks a law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.759" offset="1186356">It seems to me that the state has myriads of ways without violating both the First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments in which they might appropriately deal with the question of obscenity.</text>

            <text syncTime="281.989" offset="1231287">I'd understood that the magistrate's premise -- that the magistrate's presence here was in order to assure that before seizure some neutral and detached magistrate would have examined the material.</text>

            <text syncTime="297.107" offset="1291786">Well, Your Honor, there are a couple of things wrong with the position which has been taken by the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.282" offset="1316551">One is, in our judgment the seizure was accomplished before the magistrate did anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.409" offset="1337031">The seizure was accomplished when 11 representatives of the law enforcement agencies went upon the premises, some of them in uniform filtered throughout the store, manned themselves in front of the entrance, took the names and otherwise intimidated persons who might have entered the store, kept the place under a virtual siege for approximately six hours, ransacked the entire premises, took out all of the films that were in the premises, took out all of the projectors that were in the premises not only took out certain articles of clothing which apparently had certain sexual connotations but also took the mannequins upon which they were displayed and either those circumstances, it seems to me that the seizure was effected at the time that they encircle and laid siege to that little bookstore.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.546" offset="1513514">That was when it occurred, and occurred before the judge even had the opportunity to focus search on anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="357.744" offset="1534307">When the magistrate's presence was neither improves nor detracts from your case.</text>

            <text syncTime="365.629" offset="1565863">I only say Your Honor, that if that may well be true, but the problem is that when somebody who appears to be a magistrate or judge and someone to whom in ordinary citizen might go for constitutional relief actually appears on the scene as an executing officer and to a warrant which he himself has issued you have problems of perhaps and even more serious kind when he goes beyond the role that the judge assumed in the Heller case by merely going on to the scene viewing the material and not exercising his prerogative as an authority to make such a search.</text>

            <text syncTime="420.780" offset="1786441">Your Honor, I think the facts would depend on each particular circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.360" offset="1800861">I think that a massive number of law enforcement authorities made themselves be an intimidating and controlling factor.</text>

            <text syncTime="431.995" offset="1831372">Well, let me -- what's the impact, let's assume there's that a proprietor is somewhat intimidated, what's that got to do with what they buy and take to the magistrate?</text>

            <text syncTime="443.256" offset="1876407">Well, I think that if they make a purchase and if they act in -- with no greater act then a customer might, then that might be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.085" offset="1911724">But it seems to me that it is possible under certain facts for a large number of people to actually take over and effectuate the seizure of the entire store by their presence and control and domination of the place before they have an opportunity to take anything back to a magistrate and under those circumstances, you might have a seizure which is premature under the circumstances that you suggest.</text>
