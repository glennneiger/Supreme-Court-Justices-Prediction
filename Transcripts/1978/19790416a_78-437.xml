            <text syncTime="21.279" offset="188479">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.707" offset="202167">This is a direct appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.227" offset="228289">The District Court held unconstitutional, Section 407 of the Social Security Act that's a provision which extends Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the two-parent families whose father is unemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.721" offset="294222">The District Court held the provision unconstitutional because it does not likewise extends such aid to similarly situated families whose mothers are unemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.644" offset="345945">The Secretary of HEW appeals the holding that that Section is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.141" offset="371963">John Pratt, Commissioner of Public Welfare and a consolidated appeal appeals only from the remedies selected by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.144" offset="411982">The Aid to Families with Dependent Children provides financial assistance to families with needy children.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.450" offset="449181">It's a program under which if a state elects to participate and submits a plan which complies the Section 402 of the Social Security Act, the federal government will participate in funding of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.076" offset="511666">Originally, the program was limited to needy children who where deprived of parental, the support of a parent by virtue of the absence from the home of the parent or a parent or the death of a parent or the incapacity of a parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.523" offset="581465">Principally, this was limited to single parent families.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.801" offset="602572">Later in adjunct program, that is the program that we're concerned with today was added.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.110" offset="627858">That program extended AFDC benefits, the two parent families where there was an unemployed father.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.949" offset="675192">Now, that program appears in Section 407 of the Social Security Act, that's 42 U.S.C. 706, I'm sorry 607.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.569" offset="725661">In order for a two-parent family to qualify under that provision, the family must show that the father has a minimum but recent connection with the employment market and that he is unemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.052" offset="783548">The Act does not require that the mother be in a labor market nor does it require that she be unemployed or that she be employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.005" offset="819388">In fact, she may be employed and the only effect of her earnings is to reduce the amount of the benefits that are paid to the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.201" offset="864214">In this case, the appellees are two families which did not qualify because the father's lack the requisite employment history.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.256" offset="904443">The Act as mentioned requires that there be some recent but minimal connections with the labor market.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="208.229" offset="936312">In both cases, the mothers and the appellee family would've qualified under the statute had they have been fathers instead of mothers, correct?</text>

            <label>Mr. William H. Alsup</label>
            <text syncTime="218.013" offset="975391">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.094" offset="983751">The fathers did not qualify because the Act requires that within one year prior to the date of application, the father have been employed that is earned at least $50.00 in six out of the preceding 13 quarters or it counts in addition to earning of $50.00 per quarter if the father had been enrolled in a training program that would've counted toward the six out of the 13 quarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.750" offset="1106422">As mentioned, neither Mr. Westcott nor Mr. Westwood satisfied this prerequisite.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.267" offset="1132440">And as Justice Stewart points out in both cases, the mothers did satisfy that requirement and they we're unemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.311" offset="1168593">Accordingly, they were denied benefit under the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.644" offset="1181968">These two families then brought this action in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.142" offset="1195969">On summary judgment the Court held the program was unconstitutional either under the rational basis test or under the substantial connection test.</text>

            <text syncTime="297.804" offset="1294608">The District Court in fact sustained that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.645" offset="1309968">The District Court reasoned that there were only purposes that could be imagined for such a program, one was to assist needy children of families which were impacted adversely by unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.708" offset="1370154">Secondly, the Court said, the unemployed fathers program have been designed to remedy a structural flow in the basic AFDC program which had encouraged unemployed fathers to desert in order that their remaining family could qualify for benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="338.445" offset="1457194">I think that's -- It has been recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.800" offset="1466598">I'll re-modify that to say that families adversely effective by unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.116" offset="1495855">Well, the District Court reasoned that with respect to the first of those two objectives, that is to assist families adversely affected by unemployment, it didn't make any difference whether it was the woman or the man who had been discharged or lost employment that both families we're just as needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.561" offset="1593657">I should say by the way that the Government does not disagree with that part of the analysis of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.811" offset="1618631">Our disagreement concerns the second goal of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.514" offset="1641409">That again is to remedy a structural flow in the basic AFDC program that had created an incentive for an unemployed father to leave home so that the mother and child or other children could qualify.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="398.028" offset="1695535">Some reports of the Secretary or a Congressional Committee indicated that that was rather pervasive, did it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_alsup" startTime="406.783" stopTime="655.738">
            <label>Mr. William H. Alsup</label>
            <text syncTime="406.783" offset="1730539">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.514" offset="1733465">In fact, I would like because that has become such an important issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.347" offset="1752795">I would like to spend a fair part of my argument time going over some of the legislative history but I think you're absolutely correct that was a predominant goal in both 1961, 1962, and 1967 when this program took final shape.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.320" offset="1828655">With respect to that goal though, the District Court said that the program might go to a part of the way towards eliminating the incentive to desert but there was still an incentive to desert and exactly the case before the Court because the mother had lost her job and therefore the family needed income and the father, though he had been connected with the labor market within the meaning of the act, nonetheless might leave home in order to qualify the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.650" offset="1958013">Therefore, the Court said the statute was -- did not go as far as necessary and to remedy the desertion problem and in fact afforded the desertion remedy intended by Congress and therefore did not satisfy the substantial connection test nor the rational basis test.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.885" offset="2046934">Now, our appeal here is a narrow one as I mentioned we do not -- in fact we agree that if the sole purpose of the unemployed fathers program had been to provide relief to needy families hurt by unemployment that it would be unconstitutional to limit the benefits based upon a stereo typical assumption that working mother's incomes are less important that working father's incomes.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.431" offset="2157066">We disagree however with the District Court's refusal to sustain the program as substantially related to the purpose to remove or mitigate that incentive for fathers to desert that was existent and identified under the prior program.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.615" offset="2241808">Let's consider that latter point for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.507" offset="2253406">The AFDC program began in 1935 as President Roosevelt said at the time he proposed it to Court the program was to provide to aid to children.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.195" offset="2292172">There we're two basic principles involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.911" offset="2303039">First, the President and Congress reason that needy children with two able body parents with be assisted by general work relief programs and unemployment compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.769" offset="2350477">Therefore, there was no especial need to enact the program for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.290" offset="2364583">However, second, children with only a single parent would not be assisted by such general work relief because as was all too common in that day such a parent would be an able to accept employment without placing the child in an institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.610" offset="2441801">That was an order to avoid breaking up the home where there was a single parent that Congress originally enacted the AFDC programs so as to give that parent a choice to be able to stay home and take care of the child in the event there was only a single parent and that applied whether the -- it was a father or a mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.972" offset="2527274">Now, over the years it became generally accepted in Congress so found that 1961, 1962, and 1967 that rather than “maintaining and strengthening family life” as Section 401 proclaims its goal to be the AFDC program in fact had a very perverse effect of breaking up homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.053" offset="2611597">President Kennedy said in his first State of the Union Address, “too many fathers unable to support their families had resulted to real or pretended desertion in order to qualify there children for help.”</text>
            <text syncTime="641.170" offset="2668022">So, the President asked Congress to pass what was then called an unemployed parent program.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.428" offset="2689128">That program provided aid both unemployed fathers and unemployed mothers but where the predominant reasons behind that --</text>

            <text syncTime="677.759" offset="2814412">The whole program is designed for families with children.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.904" offset="2831026">Now, two reasons were given by the administration and throughout the legislative history for enacting the program in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.229" offset="2872299">First, the country was in a recession and extension of AFDC to families that were hurt by unemployment was a form of temporary unemployment relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.515" offset="2921409">Second however, Congress did want to reduce or mitigate the incentive for fathers to desert which have been caused since 1935 by the basic AFDC program itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.655" offset="2973968">Now, even though we're concern principally with 1967 change, this legislative history in 1961 and 1962 is very pertinent because it reflects and eliminates Congressional intent in dealing with this problem over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.209" offset="3032168">Secretary Ribicoff appeared as the lead of witness or the second witness behind Secretary Goldberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.067" offset="3055679">He said, “This bill would eliminate one of the major concerns expressed through the years about aid to dependent children namely that unemployed fathers are forced to desert their families in order that their families may receive aid.”</text>
            <text syncTime="750.548" offset="3105520">He presented convincing evidence of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.150" offset="3115969">He showed that there was an overwhelming percentage of cases in which there was no father in the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.580" offset="3141674">In fact, the 1958 statistic show this and only 1% of the AFDC cases, 1% was there just a father in the home with the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.598" offset="3185768">And 70% of the cases there was mother in the home with the children but no father and --</text>

            <text syncTime="975.457" offset="4005177">Congress did not remedy this precise situation and the 1967 Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.244" offset="4028374">Now, for example on the House in 1961, in the House Floor, Representative McCormick said about this great provision, “it is my considered opinion which is shared by many social welfare leaders that these restrictions referring to the previous program have contributed to advance instability and synthetic desertions when such desertions represented the fathers only means of getting adequate financial protection for his minor children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.881" offset="4150941">That has been cited in the briefs but because it's in a footnote let me call the Court's attention to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.394" offset="4176959">That's 107 Congressional Record 3768.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.730" offset="4198275">Now we cited other passages similar to that in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.198" offset="4216142">The program was passed it was optional only with the states just the unemployed parent program in 12 states quickly adopted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.148" offset="4248012">But the program ran out a year later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.202" offset="4260133">Secretary Ribicoff came back to Congress and successfully obtained another extension of the same program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.953" offset="4287195">He submitted the report during the senate hearings on the bill which showed that in fact it had accomplished the purpose in part of preventing family breakups.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.980" offset="4323244">He said that one of the most significant services which the ADC-UP referring to unemployed parents program offered the recipient families was “the prevention of family breakups.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.943" offset="4371101">Assistant Secretary Wilbur Cohen also testified one of the reasons why the recommendation was made was to provide assistance where there was unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.124" offset="4407881">So as not to encourage men to leave their homes in order to make their families eligible, it appears page 154 of the Senate Hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.710" offset="4442258">And then Representative Keil (ph) said concerning the extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.305" offset="4464619">“It seemed to me last year or it seemed to us last year before the provision was first added that Congress was saying this to the unemployed father.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.863" offset="4494817">If you stay with your family and try to hold it together during this critical period, we can offer you no federal assistance but if you happen to desert them, your family will be fully eligible for Aid to Dependent Children.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.994" offset="4547375">He continued, this seems then and it seems to us now an anomalous and indefensible situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.921" offset="4571094">Moreover, there is evidence which indicates that this new program has already had the effect of returning fathers to their families.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.079" offset="4607666">A study he said conducted by HEW for the first seven months of the program's operations shows that of the 66,100 applications allowed at that time 2,900 families which have been receiving Aid to Dependent Children for reasons other than unemployment became eligible under the new program usually because an absent father had returned to the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.303" offset="4704632">Now, in 1967 Congress restricted the program to unemployed fathers only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.055" offset="4739636">The recession had passed at that time and the principle objective in 1967 in restricting it only to unemployed fathers was that Congress had intended to remedy the structural incentive built-in to the original program for fathers to desert.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.589" offset="4821765">I will only burden you with one quotation from the Senate Report in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.129" offset="4843917">They said, “many is concerned about the effect that absence of a state program has on family stability where there is no such program and let me pause here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.843" offset="4886758">There were only 22 states at that time which had adopted this program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.392" offset="4900968">Congress was concerned that the other 28 had not yet adopted it where there is no such program there is an incentive for an unemployed father to desert his family in order to make them eligible for assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.320" offset="4948616">This will be a matter of continuing study by the committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.356" offset="4964812">This program was originally conceived by Congress as one to provide aid for the children of unemployed fathers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.825" offset="4986650">However, some states make families in which the father is working but the mother unemployed eligible for assistance the Bill will not allow such situations.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1892.458" offset="7673187">But we say the a fundamental reason that Congress enacted this program, and my brief bares this out in terms of legislative history was to get benefits out of families whose principal wage earner had been laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.678" offset="7718118">When President Kennedy came into office in 1961, he found the tremendous recession and institute two major programs right after that to extend that employment compensation and to provide benefits to wage earners who couldn't find jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.049" offset="7775587">The concept was one of the equality of treatment why should a child whose father sits at home because his employer is shut down be any less needy, any less where the benefits in a father -- than a child whose father has simply walked out the door, the idea was to take care of children whose wage earners had been let down by the economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.741" offset="7866284">This is what AFDC-U was generated to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.708" offset="7890213">In short, the District Court's remedy has two flaws, as a constitutional matter, it over steps the limits which Congress set for AFDC-U program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.908" offset="7935039">As a matter of equity, its remedy exceeds the scope of the constitutional wrong which it would remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.751" offset="7966386">A principal wage earner remedy that advocated by the Commissioner would assist every family whose principal wage earner whether male or female is an unemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.589" offset="8009749">That is a complete remedy and more accurately preserves the Congressional conception of the AFDC-U program which I discussed with Justice Stewart and Mr. Chief Justice Burger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.139" offset="8059904">The Secretary in its brief now attempts to buttress the District Court's remedy from another direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.897" offset="8086967">He asserts that his power to define unemployment by this Court from adopting the principal wage earner remedy even if that remedy more accurately reflects the intent to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.601" offset="8137749">Secretary's argument misreads Section 407, it must be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.096" offset="8167737">Turning first to legislative history and quite briefly because I've discussed it, the key when the commission is I to this case is what Congress meant when it selected the father as the parent who must be unemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.002" offset="8227401">Congress identify the principal wage earners whose unemployment would impoverish their families as fathers, purged to this sex bias only the legislative focus upon the family's principal wage earner remains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.982" offset="8283303">Substitution of the term “principal wage earner” for term “father” would preserve the legislative purpose to assist those families whose true bread winners were unemployed no more and no less.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.292" offset="8352580">Turning to the Secretary's argument, the plane language of Section 407 rebuts the Secretary's assertion the only he has the power to adopt the principal wage earner remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.679" offset="8402108">The Secretary now points to exclusive discretion under Section 407 to define unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.614" offset="8433873">Section 407 defines an eligible family in terms of and I quote, “the unemployment has determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary of its father.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.232" offset="8488312">Section 407 only authorizes the Secretary to define unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.759" offset="8510360">It does not authorize him to redefine term “father.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.710" offset="8530213">These two terms expressed very different concepts unemployment is a relative notion subject to empirical definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.101" offset="8567724">A definition appropriately left to administrative discretion on ongoing basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.537" offset="8589563">Congress' choice of the term “father” on the other hand represents a policy judgment as to which families should be entitled to benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.302" offset="8624567">The Commissioner argues those families whose principal wage earner has been knocked out of the labor force.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.004" offset="8655391">In order to reaffirm the limits on the judicial ability to rewrite legislation, this Court should reverse the remedy ordered by the District Court and put the principal wage earner remedy in it instead.</text>

            <text syncTime="2172.740" offset="8794363">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.035" offset="8807528">Under Section 407 of the Social Security Act, appellees are denied desperately needed cash and medical benefits for one reason and one reason only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.953" offset="8851205">The parent and the family whose unemployment cause the destitution is female.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.921" offset="8871058">These families are just as needy as those who received benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.731" offset="8886314">The female parent has extensive of work history and does has willing to comply with work requirements as the male parent whose unemployment qualifies the family for benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.290" offset="8928528">The problem with the appellee families apparently, is that the mother for reasons of circumstance or of choice does not conform to traditional stereo types and is or has been a family breadwinner, but only traditional that is male bread winners can qualify family for AFDC-U benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.148" offset="9012015">The gender discrimination that we have in this case is more onerous than that what this Court has encountered in any prior gender discrimination cases because of a combination at work here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.736" offset="9058304">First, subsistence benefits, benefits needed for survival are being denied and secondly, the act imposes an absolute bar to receive to those benefits rather than simply applying a further test under which a showing must be made such as a test of dependency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.817" offset="9134686">Since there is gender discrimination in this case, the test to be applied as this Court most recently reiterated in Orr versus Orr last month is that the gender classification must serve important governmental objectives and be substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.</text>

            <text syncTime="2284.403" offset="9240952">Right and then in any events it was, what that did was limited discretion of a divorce court judge no matter what the situation was he was simply not prohibitive from ever awarding alimony in favor of a husband against (Voice Overlap) wife but that involved private property of two other people, this involves government largesse and there are opinions in that area or somewhat -- it was somewhat different cast, don't they?</text>

            <text syncTime="2310.249" offset="9344397">Well, there might be somewhat more division it is still clear that the Orr decision was applying to test that it previously been applied by this Court in Califano versus Webster, Califano versus Goldfarb cases involving the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.033" offset="9399463">So, Government benefits have been tested under the same standard by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.235" offset="9428302">In seeking to avoid the effect of this test however, the Solicitor General particularly in his brief has argued that there was one objective really and one objective only for the AFDC-U program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.936" offset="9479084">And that was to encourage fathers not parents not the father or the mother but just the father to remain in the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.646" offset="9509909">But as the state has also argued the overriding objective of the AFDC-U program through out its history has been to meet needs of children cause by unemployment of parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.670" offset="9554004">And that objective is of course totally unserved by the gender classifications to this (Voice Overlap).</text>

            <text syncTime="2386.658" offset="9650030">There were really two years here were decisions were made with regard to the AFDC-U program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.230" offset="9672286">The first was in 1961 when the program was created and then was clearly sex neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.097" offset="9691721">If no change has been made 1967, the Westcott family, The Westwood family would have qualified for benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.460" offset="9717217">So, what we have here is a cutback made in 1967.</text>

            <text syncTime="2413.408" offset="9757027">That is correct and the AFDC-U program is a sub-program clearly sub-program of the AFDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.227" offset="9776253">AFDC was designed to meet the needs of dependent children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.158" offset="9796002">AFDC-U was added in 1961 to expand the class of dependent children whose needs were going to be met by the program namely to include the children of the unemployed and that definition of the dependent child has been maintained in the AFDC-U program until the state, the dependent child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.953" offset="9871235">The child qualifying for benefits of the program is the child deprived of parental supporter care by reason of the unemployment and it was just the word of strange in 1967 was unemployment of a father instead of unemployment of the parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.664" offset="9925987">The clearly, the purpose reflective by the statutory language and by the legislative history through out was to meet a need cause by an unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.487" offset="9961305">Indeed in 1967 former HEW Secretary Ribicoff, now Senator Ribicoff has stated that a child can be just as hungry if a parent is unemployed as a parent is dead absent or incapacitated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.214" offset="10024208">Indeed, nowhere in the legislative history is there any statement or any reflection that the fundamental purpose of the AFDC-U program to meet needs was being rejected or abandoned or even diminished by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2595.712" offset="10486262">We would say that the purpose of the introduction of the gender classifications was consistent with the general concern that Congress had in 1967 as regard to AFDC-U program that some states were qualifying families for benefits on the basis of the so-called unemployment of a family member who they assume to be homemaker, the housewife when that person really had no prior task into the workforce and was not the type of person whom Congress saw as unemployed who was losing income and therefore someone who created the need that Congress was to meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.739" offset="10634324">Congress addressed this in several ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.909" offset="10646967">It addressed it by adding a primary attachment to the work force task.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.181" offset="10664103">But it would seem that in terms of the stereo difficult thinking that the real wage earner in the family is the father and that the mother is basically person who stays at home but a way of nailing down that decision was to deny a whether there was unemployed mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.375" offset="10724916">Now, we don't really know because that the problem we have here is that the legislative history is generally so uninformative.</text>

            <text syncTime="2715.726" offset="10966288">We find it quite easy to find in the legislative history with regards to other sections of the AFDC program which were enacted specifically to address the question of desertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.153" offset="11023966">In fact, in taking the action that Congress took in the Social Security Amendments of 1967, the bill that we're addressing here today both committee reports had a heading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.825" offset="11066702">One heading that said AFDC-U program and another heading that said desertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.584" offset="11085720">And under the heading desertion, two provisions were discussed, one, to strengthen the child support program under which states would identify and pursue absent parents for child's supports; and the other to impose a so-called AFDC freeze under which federal reimbursement to the states there will be cut on federal reimbursement to the states for absent parent cases so that if the states absent parent case load increase there will be no further federal funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.311" offset="11192613">Congress made it clear that the reason for this was to store the states into action to do something about desertion to improve their family services, to strengthen the child support program but in both of those instances and which Congress explicitly addressed the question of desertion it did so clearly in a sex neutral matter in terms of the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.100" offset="11275786">There is no indication that it was a less concern about a mother deserting family than about a father deserting a family.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.590" offset="11301700">And clearly if Congress had such an anti-desertion objective related to the AFDC-U program it too would've been sex neutral and of course the gender discrimination would not bear fair and substantial relationship to such an objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.131" offset="11367946">The Solicitor General to be noted has made no attempt to defend to the gender discrimination in this case on the basis of a general congressional desire to maintain family stability or to deter desertion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3517.897" offset="14174960">But they were benefits that went to the family not every person, not every serviceman or servicewoman received those benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.455" offset="14213204">It was only if there is a dependent it was to a husband-wife family that those benefits were being provided and they were provided to all families in which the husband was the employee, but they were not provided to all families in which the woman was employee and they were family benefits that issued in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.119" offset="14271822">So, we submit that there is clearly gender discrimination involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.769" offset="14298467">And therefore it's unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.067" offset="14315604">In sum then with regards to the case on merits, it is our argument that the purpose -- the overriding purpose of the AFDC-U program is to meet the need of children caused by the unemployment of parent and the denial on the basis of the sex of that unemployed parent neither to serves nor as related to important governmental objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.299" offset="14396583">The purpose for the gender classifications was not to deter desertion but rather that purpose was served in sex neutral terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.117" offset="14431796">And finally, the classification was based upon sex stereotypes upon archaic and overbroad generalizations about the roles of men and women as breadwinners and I should also note, we have not discussed but the roles of men and women as family deserters with the assumption that it is the father who always desert the family despite the statistical showing that there are more fathers and mothers who desert.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.679" offset="14526046">But still clearly desertion is something that might confront either parent and this Court has never accepted sex stereotyping simply on the basis that more of one sex than another sex might engage in certain behavior and therefore denied benefits to all members of the sex because of the possible behavior of a certain members of the sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.474" offset="14609220">Accordingly, the decision on merit should be affirmed and I will turn to the question of remedy raised in this case solely by the State of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.155" offset="14647986">I will first discuss for a moment the traditional choice of remedy, the choice that has always confronted this Court in the past between invalidation of the program itself or extension to the class that has been excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.308" offset="14700648">In this case, the class of families with an unemployed mother where the families denied benefits solely because the unemployed parent was a female and not male.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.361" offset="14740773">We raise this for minute because the state's attack on extension has included the argument that extension violates the principle of separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.079" offset="14779643">We will then turn to the restructuring primary wage earner remedy urged by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.661" offset="14805974">Extension of benefits to the excluded class follows the consistent line of this Court's equal protection benefit cases including gender discrimination cases and it's clearly correct.</text>
