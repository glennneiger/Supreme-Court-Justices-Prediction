            <text syncTime="47.223" offset="188813">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.386" offset="201456">The facts in this case are relatively simple and pretty much undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.220" offset="224862">I'll go over them briefly and we will launch into, all the multi-faceted issues that this case ultimately presents.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.981" offset="247850">Jacque Hunter and a codefendant were convicted on guilty pleas -- a burglary charge then in Terrell Superior Court then in South Georgia near Albany.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.660" offset="294557">They were each sentenced of the two years probated, provided that they each paid fines and costs and attorney's fees that amounted to some $250.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.643" offset="342518">Codefendant's family was there in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.044" offset="352131">He paid the fine reasonable promptly or they paid the fine, it's not clear or even relevant I guess who.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.105" offset="376372">But in any event, he was released.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.615" offset="386403">Jacque Hunter, when the court -- the trial judge inquired of her whether she could pay a fine, had indicated to her that she thought to him, that she thought so, and named two cousins --</text>

            <text syncTime="109.446" offset="437708">Well, she said, “Yes, sir,” but I don't think I'm mischaracterizing it to put it that way, I think that this is a -- I think this whole episode has to be viewed as a typical one and that is when a defendant is appearing for pronouncement of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.264" offset="496953">I think always, his hopes outrun his --</text>

            <text syncTime="129.238" offset="516911">But, I think the gist of them are that, I'm not sure that that's important either.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.852" offset="535406">But, in any event, she did indicate that she could pay a fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.139" offset="548467">When the judge inquired further, she named two cousins that she was going to look to, to pay the fine.</text>

            <text syncTime="163.281" offset="653061">No sir, they had -- subsequently, ten months after this sentence was -- I mean ten weeks after the sentence was passed and it became apparent that her hopes or expectation of whatever they were, were not going to come to pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.088" offset="712307">She sued out writ of habeas corpus in the Terrell Superior Court with volunteer counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.938" offset="727667">Ironically, the hearing occurred before the same – before the trial judge which is not normally -- it would simply be a coincidence on Georgia law.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.131" offset="768522">Also coincidentally, it occurred within the term of court when he still had plenary power over the sentence in all respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.075" offset="796212">But in any event at that particular hearing, which I don't believe is part of the record before this Court, there was no testimony taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.337" offset="825260">The parties just simply proceeded on the basis that she was in jail because she had no money.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.681" offset="846681">There was no detailed explanation made at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.044" offset="856085">No inquiry even made at that time as to why the cousins hadn't paid or even what basis she had had for making that original statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="225.881" offset="903523">I notice the statute provides, as a proviso in it that provided such defendant shall not be entitled to any rebate or refund of any part of such fine so paid in case such probation shall be revoked by law.</text>

          <turn speaker="james_c_bonner_jr" startTime="238.497" stopTime="239.009">

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="239.009" offset="955977">Is it fair to infer from that that if the defendant had paid the fine, had been put on probation and served it without any wrong doing, that the expiration, the period of probation, the fine would have been repaid to her?</text>

            <text syncTime="251.561" offset="1006237">No sir, that's not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.436" offset="1013656">I think that this might be a misimpression that inadvertently arouse from one of the state's arguments, that is the fine is somehow stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.158" offset="1048555">It's not a stake in a positive sense because the fine once paid is lost, even successful completion of probation, even if she had been discharged as a model citizen after one year wouldn't have resulted in that money being refunded.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.583" offset="1106233">To this degree, it does represent -- there is an added risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.658" offset="1122534">I might add here that an affluent defendant faces, when he pays the fine immediately and hits the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.929" offset="1159628">If Jacque Hunter for example, had been given leave to pay in installments and had validated her probation after two weeks, the relative amount of money she would lose would be -- she would have lost the $250.00, probably just only a small part out of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="304.014" offset="1216052">What if she had been sentenced to pay the fine in installments which she was concededly able to pay at the time and she with the sentence was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.525" offset="1262028">And then four months later, she defaulted on an installment and offered testimony on habeas that she is simply wasn't able to financially pay that installment?</text>

            <text syncTime="331.633" offset="1326498">Well, I think -- I don't think there's any doubt that having been afforded a fair opportunity to pay the fine in installments that her probation could be revoked if she failed to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.415" offset="1393580">Now, obviously we're talking about a gray area.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.536" offset="1402044">There's very large gray area here because it's obviously a very easy question if she willfully fails to pay the fine if she had squandered a fair opportunity to make installment payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.876" offset="1447497">It's quite another -- it's quite at the other end of the spectrum if she goes out and pounce every door in the county looking for a job and she can't get one.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.975" offset="1479889">But, I think that particular kind of question is probably going to be buried in the proper use of the Court's discretion when it's faced with ratification petition if one has ever filed on that particular ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.006" offset="1531925">And indeed, Your Honor, one may not ever be filed on that particular ground because our probation officer may understand what effort she is making and simply not prefer those kind of charges.</text>

            <text syncTime="416.625" offset="1666403">Now, if the record is apparently muddy and you claim otherwise, that she was able to pay the fine or someone would pay it on her behalf, and he therefore quite consciously decided, “I will suspend the imposition of sentence and impose a fine on you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="431.083" offset="1724291">Now, can she come in four months later and say, “Well, I know that the representation was made at the sentencing, I could pay the fine.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.263" offset="1821048">The question, which would be before the Court on writ of habeas corpus is whether she is being confined essentially for failure to pay money.</text>

            <text syncTime="1365.693" offset="5462727">I mean, there again, the judge would have made a specific evaluation, a specific judgement and we couldn't impeach it, and we couldn't get behind it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1633.908" offset="6535628">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.308" offset="6549211">The overwriting issue in this case is whether or not it is constitutional for a state trial judge to condition probation upon prepayment of a fine where the defendant represents to the court that he or she is able to pay a fine but subsequently is unable to pay the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.016" offset="6615980">And for that reason, is not allowed to serve the sentence on probation but rather is incarcerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.376" offset="6641476">An underlying issue is whether or not a trial judge is should be able in the exercise of their vast although not unlimited discretion to consider the financial resources available to a defendant in determining whether or not he is at good risk for probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.392" offset="6709499">The petitioner in this case appeared, in the Superior Court of Carol County in December 1976 after having been indicted with one other person for a residential burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.322" offset="6749205">As Mr. Bonner has recited the plea of guilty entered at that point, the trial judge has turned his attention to the question of what an appropriate sentence would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.278" offset="6789016">The -- upon inquiry, the petitioner responded affirmatively that she would be able to pay a fine and that a cousin would be, probably called upon to help her with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.588" offset="6826318">Trial court then imposed a two-year probated sentence or two-year sentence on each defendant to be probated upon the condition that each of them pay a fine of a $165.00 plus court cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.749" offset="6870936">Subsequently, the additional portion of that, the money for the attorney's fees was stricken with Trial court after the habeas corpus hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.468" offset="6909806">The codefendant was able to pay his fine and was released.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.603" offset="6918374">Petitioner however did not pay her fine and remained incarcerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.250" offset="6932898">She's had been on a personal recognizance bond for the duration of this habeas corpus proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.760" offset="6959020">The petition for habeas corpus, which were file in the Superior Court of Carol County, there was a hearing held at which there was no evidence introduced other than the transcripts of the prior proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.224" offset="7008862">Now, at that hearing, and I would like to point out to the Court that the transcript of that hearing only, very recently became available to the parties and the time the briefs were filed in this case, that transcripts was not in fact available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.855" offset="7059331">But at that -- what that transcript does reflect is that at that hearing, there was an assertion by her attorney that he believed she could pay the fine in installments.</text>

            <text syncTime="1945.293" offset="7781146">Yes sir, in both -- that case and also Williams versus Illinois, there were statutory provisions and question which authorizes specific sentence in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.711" offset="7822838">And as I stated in this case, we do not have a challenge to the statute but rather just to the judges action and conditioning probation upon pre-payment of the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.878" offset="7875500">As we noted in our brief and I will not (Inaudible) with the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.754" offset="7886994">Decisions of this Court have not treated indigents as a suspect class for the purposes of equal protection analysis in each and every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.436" offset="7921685">For this reason, we contend that even though this case arises in the criminal justice system, that pass of strict scrutiny is not the applicable test but rather the rational basis test is the applicable test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.341" offset="7973303">The question is whether there is a rational basis for a trial judge to consider a defendant's economic status in determining whether he has a risk for probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.060" offset="8016144">Recent decisions of the Court have underscored this point in cases such as the San Antonio School District case, more recently the abortion case, Meyer versus Roe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.083" offset="8052297">These decisions all involve legislative or administrative classifications but they did make clear that the mere fact that the impact of a challenged statute or regulation does fall most heavily upon the indigent is not sufficient to constitute discrimination against the suspect class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.640" offset="8118544">Now, the petitioner contends that there's a distinction between cases involving public funding of schools, welfare and related programs and between cases arising under the criminal justice system such as this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.708" offset="8174759">There are some supports for that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.414" offset="8181656">There is a footnote in the Meyer versus Roe opinion indicating that the principals of Griffin versus Illinois have not been applied to legislative classifications generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.547" offset="8222093">But I will also point out to the court that there are contrary indications such as the language in the San Antonio School District case in which the very cases of Tate versus Short, and Williams versus Illinois were discussed at some length by the Court and of the majority opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.297" offset="8281130">And the opinion that it flatly stated that all of the judges often do consider a defendant's ability to pay a fine and imposing a fine that in doing so --</text>

            <text syncTime="2102.678" offset="8410697">The discussion of the Tate case and of the Williams case which is contained in the San Antonio opinion pointed out or stated, in dicta admittedly, that in imposing fines, judges are guided by sound judicial discretion rather than constitutional mandates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.166" offset="8480601">There are in fact a number of cases within the criminal justice system in which this Court has refused to apply strict scrutiny test in an equal protection analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.832" offset="8523233">For example, in Ross versus Muffet, the court in 1974 decision, in which it was held at the Equal Protection Clause nor the Due Process Clause, neither of them required the state to appoint counsel for indigents on discretionary appeals after direct appeals had been exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.071" offset="8588225">There was reference in that case to the other decisions outside of the criminal law area in which indigents have not been considered a suspect class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.754" offset="8626991">I would submit that Ross versus Muffet is a recognition by this Court, that is it is not possible to have absolute equality within the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.434" offset="8665652">There are other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.784" offset="8671086">Now, for example, the Court rejected an equal protection challenge in a case involving New York parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.360" offset="8697417">A New York statute said in parole eligibility, that are in clearly favor in those who had been or just clearly discriminated in those who's been unable to make bond prior to their trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.998" offset="8739944">An equal protection argument was summarily rejected in that case, McGinnis versus Roister.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.246" offset="8760947">Would also point out that an examination of the case as such as Griffin versus Illinois and it's progeny reveals that the Court has in fact invalidates statutes and practices which have placed the indigent at a disadvantage in the criminal justice system for no rational reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.845" offset="8823327">The lack of a rational reason I submit is a compelling factor in all of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.560" offset="8846211">Now, for example, in the Griffin case, the courts found and I think very correctly, that there's no rational relationship between the defendant's ability to pay calls for an appeal in advance in its guilt or innocence, there's just couldn't be any relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.293" offset="8901172">And for that reason, and others, the Illinois requirement was struck then.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.680" offset="8918622">The irrationality simply being in the fact that the merits of a post trial motion is in nowhere related to a defendant financial status.</text>

            <text syncTime="2433.583" offset="9734269">First of all, we contend that it's not constitutionally required to -- or it should not be required -- the Court should not be prohibited from considering the defendants financial status and all other relevant factors in determining whether he or she is a good risk for probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.060" offset="9800202">Secondly, we contend that the trial judge in assessing the sentence or determining what appropriate terms of probation would be or should be allowed to rely upon the defendant's assertion that he or she would be able to pay a fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.753" offset="9858926">Now, in this case, I would point out that the defendant was represented by appointed counsel and there's no challenge to counsels confidence and no challenge to the voluntariness of the guilty plea.</text>

            <text syncTime="2554.125" offset="10216490">But we -- the point that I was trying to make was that where a defendant is represented by counsel and indicates to the court, after having been advised with counsel and after having into a plea of guilty, that she can in fact pay a fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.688" offset="10270720">And then I should also point out that there was no effort made to withdraw the guilty plea at that time where there was no, at least the record reflects, no complaint of any type about either the sentence or the fine or any other aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.641" offset="10334563">Our position is that the -- to allow that the sentencing court to consider all pertinent factors is a very consistent of what this Court has decided in numerous cases, such as William versus New York in 1949 case, in which the Court stated emphatically that under the modern philosophy of penology, the punishment is supposed to fit the offender and not merely the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.363" offset="10425365">The rational of that decision was recently reiterated by the Court, and the decision handed down on June 26 of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.315" offset="10453159">I -- after the filing of that brief, United States versus Grayson, in which the majority of this Court held that -- upheld the action of a federal trial judge who had stated on the record that he had given a particular defendant a longer sentence because of his personal belief that the defendant had lied on the stand while he is testifying his own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.187" offset="10536647">The Grayson Court concluded that a defendant's truthfulness or mendacity was relevant to his prospects of rehabilitation as a reflection of his attitude towards society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.920" offset="10579592">The facts are obviously quite different, but we submit that under the rationale of Grayson and similar cases that to allow sentencing judge to consider along with many other factors, the financial resources available to a defendant in the event he is sentenced to probation is constitutional and is in fact desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.405" offset="10649600">Now, we do point out in our brief that in probably the majority of cases would not even be a germane factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.948" offset="10679693">In some case, very serious crimes, there would not be any factor at all to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.040" offset="10700069">But nevertheless, the court should not be deprived of the opportunity to recognize that someone is perhaps a better risk for probation because of their ability to pay a fine into the court under such circumstances as the court dictates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.308" offset="10765166">Now, to ignore that factor would in fact, be to ignore reality and I believe that an example of the reality of that is that since 1945, the federal rules of criminal procedure have provided that a pre-sentence investigation shall contain an information about the defendant's financial condition along with many other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.779" offset="10843115">The decision to grant probation is in fact difficult or perhaps more difficult in the decision of what number of years to give one who is going to be incarcerated, has great consequences for the defendant obviously, and also for society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.563" offset="10894211">We submit that the trial judge should not be encumbered in carrying out this very difficult function.</text>
