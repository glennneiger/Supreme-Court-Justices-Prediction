            <label>Mr. Noyes Thompson Powers</label>
            <text syncTime="19.799" offset="183547">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.312" offset="197653">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.724" offset="219282">At issue is whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 permits an employer and a union to remedy the past exclusion of minorities and women from craft employment by establishing a new craft training program which takes account of race and sex in selecting those to be trained.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.385" offset="317921">Let me begin by stating one central fact, the provisions of the 1974 Kaiser Steelworker Labor Agreement which are being challenged in this case where a remedial measure adopted in response to employment discrimination litigation concerning a lack of minorities and women in craft employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.266" offset="413424">Those are not simply my words.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.026" offset="424500">They are contained in the provisions of the labor agreement itself and they appear in paragraph 5 of plaintiff's complaint in this case which is reprinted in the appendix at page 11 and they were admitted not only by the company but by the union in its answer to the complaint which appears in page 17 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.944" offset="532125">So the character of the program is not really in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.597" offset="554799">It was remedial and it sought to do more than remedy or achieve racial balance for society sake.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.541" offset="598580">The program was explicitly focused in response to employment discrimination litigation in which both Kaiser and the steelworkers were then engaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.207" offset="653228">To meet the situation, the Kaiser Steelworker Agreement established a new program at 15 company plants under which Kaiser employees who had no prior craft experience could achieve training.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.391" offset="721983">And, as was being done in the steelworks consent decree to which the steelworkers were a party, the agreement provided that 50% of the training opportunities would be allotted to minorities and women.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.165" offset="797006">One of those 15 clients is the Gramercy Louisiana plant which is engaged -- which is the site of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.075" offset="840683">It is important to emphasize that the company's desire to assure compliance with its Title VII and Executive Order obligations were not simply involved in the establishment of the 1974 program, they were the reason for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.320" offset="933679">If the company had been able to recruit what it regarded as adequate numbers of minorities and women who were already fully trained, then it would have had every reason to continue to take advantage of its ability to recruit fully trained craftsmen and save the substantial cost that training involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.331" offset="1041721">As it's clear from the record, at the Gramercy plant alone, by agreeing to this training program, the company undertook an obligation that could be expected to cost it $400.00 up to $400,000.00 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.261" offset="1121447">Now, this training program provided opportunities not only for blacks and women but for white males who had no prior craft experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.825" offset="1175677">The respondent Brian Weber was one of those employees who had no prior craft experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.564" offset="1210681">And when opportunities came to bid in this new craft training program, he bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.661" offset="1235028">And when he was not selected, he filed a charge under Title VII alleging that he would have been discriminated against because blacks less senior than he had been selected.</text>

            <text syncTime="310.403" offset="1345996">It does concede that both the substantially low employment of minorities and women in craft jobs at the time and the fact that it had insisted on prior experience as a condition not only for employment as a full craftsman but also for entry to into training programs where factors that a court might have used in finding that there was a prima facie case of discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="370.433" offset="1586113">We certainly would concede that it's arguable and I think the Fifth Circuit's decision in Parson against Kaiser which involves a neighboring plant of Kaiser to the Gramercy plant and one that is also subject to this 1974 agreement shows that courts could reach that conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="393.426" offset="1678064">Well, what I'm asking whether ultimately whether you concede that after the case, that you could not make out any defense but do you concede that the figures would make a prima facie case that would require you to come forward?</text>

            <text syncTime="414.841" offset="1763746">We do recognize that there are the elements that a court might use to find such a prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.989" offset="1792376">The two points that we want to stress at this time are these, in our judgment the standard which the Fifth Circuit adopted and which the lower court and which the respondents argue for that there must be a proof of prior discrimination and an identification of the victims of that discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.817" offset="1895612">Well, literary in affirmative action, if that is the price that employers and unions must pay, in order to try to remedy the exclusions of the past, it is in our judgment prohibitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.872" offset="1955903">Secondly, we consider that the type of remedial action that was taken in this case is consistent with the standards which a majority of this Court approved in the Bakke case and are otherwise reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="913.754" offset="3759397">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.704" offset="3775175">The case that's here today reflects one small part of what was the nationwide program undertaken by the Steelworkers Union in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.684" offset="3819165">In that year, it negotiated not just with this company, and not just with this industry but with all the major industries whose employees it represents programs similar to this at every plant providing that where a racial imbalance exists as between the production jobs and the craft jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.591" offset="3906727">A quota would be instituted awarding 50% of those jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.548" offset="3922610">The craft jobs and craft training jobs to minorities until that imbalance had been eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.976" offset="3952285">The union has since reconfirmed its commitment to that program at three successive conventions despite robust debate including arguments against that program from delegate Brian Weber at the most recent convention which followed the Fifth Circuit's decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.600" offset="4018845">And the union is most anxious to sustain as lawful its right to negotiated contracts of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.855" offset="4051864">Now, the union's view as to what Title VII permits is somewhat different from that of the company and it's broader.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.922" offset="4084046">In our view, Congress in prohibiting discrimination in Title VII did not intend to prohibit any form of, and I would call it affirmative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.345" offset="4137754">Congress did not intend to take from private employers and unions the right to adopt the program where they had a segregated workforce regardless whether that segregation was their own fault, was the fault of other societal factors and without the need to have to conduct the major investigation to trace just what the cause of that segregation was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.628" offset="4234930">That the mere existence of that segregation was an undesirable phenomenon which that company and union could address by the adoption of the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1929.786" offset="7823527">We shall not regulate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1964.397" offset="7961976">The United States agrees that the plan at issue before the Court is a valid plan but with -- there are many differences between our position and that of the union we just spoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.622" offset="8034910">We also agree that that the issue is a statutory issue of reconciling the broadly worded prohibitions of Title VII with the statutes remedial purposes and with its emphasis on voluntary compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.499" offset="8094365">However, we believe it would be a mistake to read the language of Title VII as it was drafted in 1964 and snippets of the many thousand of pages of legislative history as dealing with the question of voluntary programs of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.081" offset="8188719">They were not in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.934" offset="8196138">They were in a realistic sense to fire this thing from the mind of the draftsmen of Title VII at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.154" offset="8240964">And while the case immediately concerns an issue of voluntary compliance program, the contentions that have been made before this Court cut much more deeply than that into the remedial fabric and effect of enforcement of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.904" offset="8324033">The respondents and I regret to say, the petitioner union, are asking the Court in this case to repudiate the numerous federal court decisions over the years that have upheld the propriety of the ordering or numerical race conscious relief to rectify the effects of an employer's proven discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2378.064" offset="9616677">And the reasons for which the program was adopted but I find it very difficult to reconcile with the interpretation of Title VII that this Court has adopted with the legislative history of the 1972 revisions to Title VII and the consistent views of the agencies that administered Title VII, the idea that this is not a prima facie showing of the violation of Title VII because it was not done with an invidious purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.845" offset="9763798">And that the broad prohibitions are to be read more narrowly and that somehow by negative implication, every employer is left free which is the reading of Section 703 (j), as the Court has been invited to make.</text>

            <text syncTime="2461.546" offset="9950626">It seems to me that's what the Court is being invited to say and it goes far to it undermining both the subtle interpretation of the prohibitions what Congress was trying to do and the effectiveness of any possible enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.092" offset="10020739">It's -- the contention is that what the Court referred to an Albemarle Paper Company is the spur or catalyst that encourages voluntary compliance is to be removed and the Court is to take it on faith that employers like Kaiser will continue to spend hundreds of thousand of dollars even though there's no possibility that a court could order them to adopt a similar program and that unions will continue to agree to such program.</text>

            <text syncTime="2824.821" offset="11403661">And a similar program was adopted that changed the representation in the plant as a whole from some 10% minority over a course of 5 years from 1969 to 1974 to 14.8% minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.036" offset="11480566">The program was one that was adopted in an atmosphere where the employer was definitely had a reasonable basis to think that he was subject to the making of a prima facie case that he was guilty of employment discrimination and as a matter of fact, the Parsons case brought against the neighboring plant of Kaiser's based on very similar statistics said the Fifth Circuit held that a prima facie case had been shown.</text>

            <text syncTime="3096.293" offset="12489519">My name is Michael Fontham and I represent the respondents in this case, Brian Weber and the Class of the non-minority employees at the Kaiser Plant in Gramercy, Louisiana who were eligible to bid for on-the-job training programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.433" offset="12546152">The issue present in this case is not the issue stated at the beginning of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.092" offset="12564752">But instead as whether a company in the labor union may institute a 50% racial quota for entry into craft training program that discriminates against non-minority employees and prefers minority employees solely to achieve a certain statistical ratio and in the absence of any past discrimination by the company or the union, against the preferred individuals, and in fact in the absence of any past discrimination at the plant in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.491" offset="12694319">In the course of argument, I would like to first of all address three factual areas which I think are of concern and have not adequately been covered discussed the law if I have an opportunity to do so and some of the arguments raised by my opponents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.577" offset="12754714">First of all with respect to the facts, I think it's important to note what the operation of the quota was in this case because Kaiser and the union have instituted training programs in the past and the basis for entry into those training programs in additional to the skills required or the absence of physical handicaps was seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.112" offset="12840814">And that seniority criterion was a plant-wide seniority criterion at this plant available to all individuals whether they were white or black or other minority whether they were male or female.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.160" offset="12889088">Every person who was hired at the gate at the Kaiser plant of obtained his or seniority status and was treated equally with respect to that seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.326" offset="12933705">But with respect to the craft training programs and I might add, that the union had been negotiating for its members to have this training opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.585" offset="12970695">The members of the union were unskilled laborers at the plant and the opportunities presented by the training programs were considered very important by these persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.211" offset="13009251">An opportunity to advance, to learn a skill, which skill can be obtained only after years of training and schooling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.131" offset="13040912">And so it was very important to this people who thought that they could obtain higher wages, better working conditions and even more importantly more security.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.497" offset="13078424">But in addition to this seniority criterion for entering into the training programs, Kaiser and union imposed a 50-50 racial quota which said that for every non-minority individual who entered a training program, they must take a minority individual so that if --</text>

            <text syncTime="3677.399" offset="14813999">And as a result of that fact, even though Kaiser --- I believe Judge Wisdom's opinion said that Kaiser had made good faith efforts, a laudable efforts to try to seek and find minority craftsmen.</text>

            <text syncTime="4211.942" offset="16952174">Well, Your Honor, the question is would the Office of Federal Contract Compliance be enforcing it but if it's not, if Congress wants to return the situation to pre-1964, I think you're absolutely right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4223.325" offset="16997731">They could do that and employers and unions could try to achieve social goal with race discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4231.490" offset="17030332">I certainly hope that Congress doesn't decide to do that but I think Congress is definitely as of now decided that there should be no race discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4240.615" offset="17066904">And what I was going to say previously is that what Kaiser and the union and the Government have apparently have decided to do in this case is to achieve the social goal which is quite laudable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.790" offset="17107550">But by the same token, Kaiser is not paying the cost nor is the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4256.589" offset="17130747">Instead the entire the cost of this program is placed on the shoulders of the non-minority group members and the unskilled labor force at Kaiser.</text>
            <text syncTime="4266.221" offset="17169304">And these persons, with respect to these persons, I don't even think that the word remedy in the broadest sense could be applied because they work side by side with the minority group members.</text>
            <text syncTime="4277.443" offset="17214130">They have the same skills.</text>
            <text syncTime="4279.010" offset="17220399">They have the same economic standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4280.994" offset="17228340">They have the same seniority rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4282.967" offset="17236281">They have the same opportunities to advance within the plant and yet the non-minority group members find it the company post bids with one of the bids saying that for this opportunity it won't be seniority but it would instead the sole criterion will be that only a member of the minority group can apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="4302.613" offset="17314858">And with respect to other bids, that it's not seniority but that at least half of the persons that we're going to select would be members of minority groups and say that there are one means of advancement within this plan, under the company union agreement, seniority is accrued after years of service to the employer in the union and is the most really, I think even this Court has said the most fundamental kind of important right for a person who works in the labor force such as this taken away that the accrued rights of the non-minority employees are simply taken away and race becomes the factor for determining who enters into the training programs superimposed upon the seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4349.128" offset="17500954">And it is, I think in view of this Court's decision in the Teamsters case where even in the case of the –- a finding of past discrimination and even in the case where you're talking about a fair degree of clarity that the persons being preferred had been discriminated against in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="4370.148" offset="17584964">The Court is saying, only with respect to the individuals that Government must bear its burden of proving that the individuals here by preponderance of the evidence but that the individuals had been discriminated against in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="4384.453" offset="17642224">In -- in this case we have a pure out and out preference being granted to members of minority groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.822" offset="17671690">We feel that under the cases decided by this Court and under Title VII, this is illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4397.400" offset="17693947">Title VII says in Section 703 (a) and I will discuss the legislative history, in fact maybe I should do that first, I think that the inferences drawn by the union in this case are very difficult to adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4411.788" offset="17751521">I think that the union's brief demonstrates very, very substantially that there was nothing sporadic and there was nothing infrequent about the statements of the supporters of Title VII with respect to the issue of quotas, with respect to the issues of preferences and of achieving racial balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4433.446" offset="17838143">The fact is that what happened when Title VII was passed was that the opponents got up and they began making claims which were regarded almost as outrageous by these supporters and the claims were, well, this would permit quotas to advance minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4448.484" offset="17898329">And Senator Humphrey saying a quota would violate Title VII and upon the same, this would permit attempting to achieve a racial balance and Senator Williams and Senator Clark and Senator Case, the persons who are really behind say no, Title VII says no discrimination against anyone whether he be a member of a minority group or a member of a non-minority group and just as we the legislative history of Title VII, I think that this is the thing that comes through the most fully.</text>
            <text syncTime="4483.436" offset="18038136">In fact, the union was able to find 90 pages or 80-some pages of legislative history all in the same subject and all of them expressing the same thing the opponent is saying you could have ratios.</text>
            <text syncTime="4497.745" offset="18095397">The supporters saying this is a non-discrimination statute that has prospective effect that will allow the breaking down of barriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4506.562" offset="18130610">And then if you would say Section 703 (j) says you can't require quotas, they will put that in there because the opponents were saying some government agency is going to require quotas which that's what Kaiser and the union, thought the Government was doing in this case, and the supporters saying they can't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4524.322" offset="18201663">It would violate Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.280" offset="18213470">And in -- so what does the statute say that's applicable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4531.049" offset="18228621">It says that there can be no discrimination against any individual with respect to their employment opportunities on the ground of race, color, sex, national origin, and the other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4545.796" offset="18287553">And Section 703 (d), what does it say?</text>
            <text syncTime="4548.054" offset="18296644">Because it's very important with respect to this argument, this is a new program and it gave opportunities to everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="4554.610" offset="18322871">Well, the fact is that Section 703 (d) says that a company or a union or a joint labor management command may not discriminate against any individual with respect to entry into training programs or with respect to the terms and conditions of training and opportunities provided under training.</text>
            <text syncTime="4575.931" offset="18408135">And I think from my own standpoint at least, the Court's decision in McDonald answered any ambiguities about construction of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="4586.688" offset="18451184">McDonald came out of the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4588.977" offset="18460275">The Fifth Circuit had dismissed the case of a white individual who allegedly had been stealing and assertedly some minority employees were not dismissed and the case was kind of decided by the Fifth Circuit in a fussy manner that left it open whether the white individual had any cause of action, one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4607.089" offset="18532791">And number two, whether the same standards were applicable to the claim of the white individual because he might have construed the Fifth Circuit as having said that well there is a cause of action but your review is different because possibility of invidiousness or nastiness of the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4625.266" offset="18605411">So the case was brought up here and the Court said that first of all a white individual does have a cause of action under Title VII and secondly and most importantly, the same standards are applicable as if that white individual were a member of the minority group.</text>
            <text syncTime="4643.346" offset="18677823">And if you apply the same standards to this case, what if Kaiser and the union imposed a discriminatory quota against members of minority groups to achieve what they thought was a desirable ratio in the workforce.</text>

            <text syncTime="4976.974" offset="20012262">I think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4980.614" offset="20026890">I think also the other -- some of the other decisions of this Court support our side of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4986.947" offset="20052177">The decision of the Court in Griggs against Duke Water indicates specifically stated that preferences in what we're talking about here is a preference that discriminates to any group minority or majority is exactly what is proscribed by Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="5003.460" offset="20118215">The decision of this Court in the City of Los Angeles against Manhart, I think is very important because in that case, although it wasn't a race discrimination case, the Court stated that the emphasis in Title VII is with respect to the rights of the individual and that it's made it clear that these rights are personal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5024.025" offset="20200448">And what we have in this case is this asserted justifications being brought up on a class basis in which the minority classes are amorphised and made into non-individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5041.885" offset="20271919">In the sense where -- when you have preferences being granted to individuals, the claim is made that these are remedies because they are members of the class and yet at the same time we have very overt discrimination against white workers that has the same kinds of economic impact or frustration or raising potential loss of the opportunity to advance that 20, 30, 40 years ago was the rule for the minority group members in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="5074.860" offset="20403785">And for that reason, we think that decision is important, very important to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5081.813" offset="20431684">The emphasis should be on the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="5084.056" offset="20440670">In the Teamsters case, this Court made it very clear that the emphasis is on the individual that we cannot have in this country decisions that are made on the basis of race or class, at least as long Title VII is operative that when the Government came in, in Teamsters and said, well, we had a fair degree of specificity here, why don't the Court just say they're all members of the class and its okay to grant them a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5111.446" offset="20550175">The Court said, prove that they were discriminated against in the past on an individual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5117.104" offset="20572850">And this is, one thing that isn't present in this case conceded by everyone, none of these persons had been discriminated against in the past by Kaiser.</text>
            <text syncTime="5127.826" offset="20615690">Instead they had equal rights with the non-minority members of the unskilled labor force.</text>
            <text syncTime="5133.087" offset="20636693">Equal rights to advance, their seniority status was the same as everyone else's except in some cases they have been working at the plant for less time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5142.292" offset="20673578">But where Kaiser and the union did was, they said that the persons who had been working at the plant for more time who had accrued economic expectations, we have to step back because Kaiser understood that the Government wanted to achieve this social goal and Kaiser was going to help the Government do it and by placing all the cost on its workers rather than any of the cost on itself or any of the cost on the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="5165.833" offset="20767723">I think that this in other factor that is very important that should be answered, these pieces of voluntary compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5172.847" offset="20795831">The one thing I think that the Court does not want to do is to allow employers and unions be the arbiters of what Title VII means.</text>
            <text syncTime="5180.890" offset="20827909">Because the one thing you can expect the company to do and the union to do, just naturally, and I'm not trying to say that this is done in wrong, I mean with the wrong intent or whatever but the fact is that if they can put the cost elsewhere, they will.</text>
            <text syncTime="5195.642" offset="20886946">And in this case, that's what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="5197.678" offset="20895096">They put the cost elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="5199.964" offset="20904291">And even if you assume that there was an arguable case, if it cost on the unskilled labor force, who themselves had no training skills, who themselves have never been to a training program, who themselves have never been to a training program, who themselves have never been in a construction union.</text>

            <text syncTime="5227.248" offset="21013379">There -- I think the one thing that the courts would not do is say because there was an asserted remedy which in fact was a preference to one member of the minority group that another individual who was actually discriminated against was barred from suing.</text>

            <text syncTime="5249.391" offset="21101986">That's correct, Your Honor, but what they immunize themselves from was harassment or in their view, harassment by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5260.069" offset="21144722">In other words, the compliance officers under the federal contract program require this utilization analysis which focus on the statistics and if the statistics are low, then the possible things that can happen are the lost of federal contracts and reporting you to the Justice Department and Publication of the company's name and even this matter which all the company lawyers think is the denial of due process, the absence of the hearing on the debarment from future contract opportunities, and this is what they avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="5291.359" offset="21269797">It really didn't have anything to do with litigation at Gramercy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.197" offset="21285157">There may have been some litigation at some other plants but the main thing that they were trying to do is getting compliance with the OFCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="5302.612" offset="21314832">Now, what they did was they went even beyond what the OFCC has ever required and actually instituted a quota that took away accrued seniority rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5310.728" offset="21347328">All that the Government has ever said that it's for previous to today is these goals and timetables and if you read the back of the Government's brief in this case you'll find that you know they even say that were quotas aren't good.</text>
            <text syncTime="5326.379" offset="21409917">And if you read what the EEOC said when they issued their guidelines they said, “Huh, somebody thought that when you said numerical ratios in our preliminary guidelines that we meant quotas but we really didn't” so they deleted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5338.833" offset="21459759">So I think that this is important too cause everybody says to me, well is this the end of affirmative action if whoever wins this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5346.157" offset="21489016">And the fact is that affirmative action has never gone so far as Kaiser and the union wanted to go in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5352.631" offset="21514930">The Government has not said that quotas are alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="5355.866" offset="21527886">Certainly, nothing ever fixed the rigid nature and in enforcing its affirmative action programs in addition to that the taking away of accrued rights has been stayed away from by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5367.137" offset="21572921">Even when you have these instances of terrible refusal to comply with the requirements to breakdown barriers at the entry level sometimes, the lower courts has said, "Well if the state police just won't comply, we'll make them higher a certain percentage for a while but they have stayed away from doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5384.800" offset="21643557">With respect to accrued rights and that's what in the case where there is a violation of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="5390.806" offset="21667589">But in this case, they go beyond any type of an affirmative action measured that's been used in the past and admitted to be used, a quota that takes away accrued seniority rights and that is in the absence of any past discrimination and I think if the Court rules in favor of my side in the case, it doesn't change anything in terms of affirmative action actually or substantively.</text>
            <text syncTime="5416.707" offset="21771243">On the other hand if the Court says that a company and the union or the federal government can require quotas, 50-50 racial quotas and as in this case that quota can discriminate against whites and take away their accrued rights and the sole purpose of the quota is to achieve the statistical parity and in this case, if Your Honors will review the record you will find that even after they achieve the 39% representation in the workforce, that they will then use the quota of how many minority group members are in the workforce at large indefinitely in order to keep in the crafts in perpetuity the exact statistical percentage of the minority group representation in the population at large --</text>

            <text syncTime="5709.809" offset="22943619">They've lost their seniority rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5712.894" offset="22955948">The goals or desires of the Government or the union or the company may have been laudable or objectives that may reach some social desirable point but the fact is that they can't try to accomplish that by discrimination against non-minority employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="5731.320" offset="23029718">The statements of Title VII which prohibit any discrimination against individuals, the legislative history of Title VII where the statements are repeated and repeated and repeated and repeated that it would not permit preferences that discrimination against non-minority group members is prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="5750.159" offset="23105055">It indicate and decisions of this Court saying that why individual cases are to be trying into the same standards as cases brought by members of minority groups all say that the class of the plaintiffs in this case, Brian Weber and the other individuals who lost their seniority status who did not have the opportunity to enter these training programs have been subjected to a violation of Title VII and there was no past discrimination in this case that could justify that in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5781.288" offset="23229503">There was no discrimination against the individuals who are being preferred and in fact there was no discrimination at the plant at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="5788.469" offset="23258237">Seniority rights were granted on a plant-wide basis to everyone and everyone had an equal opportunity to advance and minority group members will advance to that seniority system and some day minority group members will be fully represented in the craft positions at that plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5805.040" offset="23324588">It may not be as speedy as some planners would desire but even so those planners cannot reach that point via discrimination against non-minority group members.</text>

            <text syncTime="5853.568" offset="23518626">First, let me say that this is not an unheard or form of an affirmative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5859.425" offset="23542136">In the two largest consent decrees which have been entered in this country, the AT&amp;T consent decree and the steel industry consent decree, this very form of action was proposed, was adopted by the lower courts that affirmed on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5877.653" offset="23614966">Secondly, Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to emphasize that we do not believe that a congressional amendment is required to approve the type of action that was taken here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5889.488" offset="23662299">We think that --</text>

            <label>Mr. Noyes Thompson Powers</label>
            <text syncTime="5891.339" offset="23669718">We think that nothing could be clear and that the Congress intended that this type of voluntary action be taken consistent with the broad remedial purposes of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5904.739" offset="23723321">There has been a suggestion that counsel have engaged in euphemisms.</text>
            <text syncTime="5910.686" offset="23747145">Let me stress that we're not suggesting that this matter should be solved in terms of a label that's placed on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5919.147" offset="23781000">And I would suggest that the action that the company and the union have taken here is entirely consistent with the words of this Court in Albemarle Paper against Moody, when it suggested that it wanted to provide the spur or catalyst that causes employers and unions to self-examine and to self-evaluate their employment practices and to endeavor to eliminate so far as possible the last vestige of an unfortunate and ignominious page in this country's history.</text>
            <text syncTime="5956.855" offset="23931779">We believe that what the company and the union have done in this case meets that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="5963.809" offset="23959677">We would suggest that far from debasing or taking away from Brian Weber and other white employees who lack craft experience at the Gramercy plant and at other Kaiser plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="5979.651" offset="24022998">What the company and the union did here enhance their seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5985.372" offset="24045881">It gave them an opportunity along with black employees and other minority employees and female employees to become craft qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="5995.941" offset="24088200">It set up that program in the best way that the company and the union could find to both respond to the value and virtues of seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="6008.543" offset="24138564">And yet to make a demonstration that the old barriers for minorities and women had ended and that the new opportunities promised by Title VII were in fact real.</text>
            <text syncTime="6025.055" offset="24204601">We believe that this is a commendable example of what can be achieved through collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="6032.624" offset="24234904">But we're not here asking for commendation, we ask only that our right to continue this program be upheld.</text>
