            <text syncTime="46.039" offset="287535">The Yakima Reservation is an extensive tract of land in Central Washington of more than 2,000 square miles, almost the size of the State of Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.527" offset="333511">Four-fifths of that land is held in trust or restricted status by the United States for the benefit of the Yakima Nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.816" offset="370604">The other one-fifth has been removed from trust status and sold almost entirely to non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.755" offset="402369">Most of the fee land is located in the northeastern portion of the reservation; it is shown in gray on the map, which is exhibit 34 in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.943" offset="455137">The population of the reservation was stipulated in the pre-trial order in this case to be about 25,000 of which 3,000 were members of the tribe. Since the date of that pre-trial order, the members of both groups have increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.481" offset="529324">Indians and non-Indians live together on most of the inhabited portions of the reservation but most of the non-Indians live on fee lands near the Yakima River.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.500" offset="589406">The Indian population is scattered more evenly throughout the non-forested portions of the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.163" offset="623992">Two small cities, Toppenish and Wapato, are located entirely inside the reservation borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.484" offset="661295">Each of those cities has an Indian population of slightly less than 10% and each of them is located almost exclusively on fee land.</text>

            <text syncTime="164.499" offset="761396">In addition to city police officers in Toppenish and Wapato, the law enforcement system includes about 40 deputy sheriffs almost twice the number who run the force at the time of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.876" offset="810924">A considerable tribal police force and the state patrol detachment with headquarters at Toppenish.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.247" offset="840391">The under-sheriff of the county is a member of the Yakima Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.090" offset="859721">Working relationships among those agencies are extremely close.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.827" offset="878634">All deputy sheriffs and all state patrolmen are crossed deputized by the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.639" offset="905906">All tribal police are crossed deputized by the sheriff with authority for arrests within the exterior boundaries of the reservation, and many of the officers of each carry federal commissions from the BIA as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.948" offset="967137">That's the bugaboo of checkerboarding and the use of tract books which is a constant refrain of the tribe and the Solicitor General is therefore just that, a bugaboo.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.623" offset="1009873">And several of the sheriff's deputies testified almost any general law enforcement officer can make an arrest anywhere on the reservation for any criminal offense, whether the offense is to be tried by a tribal court, a state court, or a Federal District Court is decided later by lawyers.</text>

            <text syncTime="348.659" offset="1498049">If it's under the state code, the offender will go to a county jail and be tried on the County Superior Court or District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.705" offset="1534203">Yakima County however thus has some difficulty in making arrests on much of the trust land because the portion of the reservation west of a line roughly like that is closed by tribal action to non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.975" offset="1607241">Perhaps it goes without saying that this is not a racial discrimination case.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.276" offset="1628453">The trial court found no discrimination against Indians and the states program of law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.519" offset="1649455">A judgment, which had based in part on the explicit testimony, is to the absence of such discrimination from the chief of the tribal police force himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.056" offset="1695640">The complaints of the Yakima's about inadequate law enforcement protection are identical to those of non-Indians in Yakima and throughout the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.977" offset="1731271">There is not enough of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.839" offset="1738689">Why is there never a police officer around when we really need one?</text>
            <text syncTime="413.641" offset="1757915">As the court is aware, we do not regard the order noting probable jurisdiction as encompassing the assertion of the tribe and the Solicitor General but Washington was required to amend it's constitution in order to assume jurisdiction under Public Law 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.338" offset="1824684">Your Honor admits -- omits that question of course for the very good reason that you made it in our favor on three occasions, in Makah, in Tonasket, and in Comenout.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.107" offset="1863764">Nevertheless, that disclaimer caused argument represents the principal submission of our opponents occupying some 60% of the 162 pages of argument in their three briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.351" offset="1916740">Our reply brief for this reason demonstrates that your three decisions on the subject were correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.968" offset="1943280">Even before one reaches the argument however that the Enabling Act in our State Constitution still prohibit our assumption of jurisdiction, one must first decide just what lands are covered geographically by the disclaimer clause language, as well as what types of governmental power or jurisdiction the state was mandated to disclaim in 1889.</text>

            <text syncTime="511.136" offset="2147871">Under the Enabling Act Language in our State Constitution, Washington disclaims, and I quote, “All right and title to all lands owned or held by any Indian or Indian tribes and until the title thereto shall have been extinguished by the United States, said Indian lands shall remain under the absolute jurisdiction of the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="537.747" offset="2254346">The United States title to fee lands on the reservation has been so extinguished.</text>

            <text syncTime="548.440" offset="2297083">And even the tribe and the Solicitor General concede that Washington has acted to assume full jurisdiction over fee lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.529" offset="2333445">Fee lands are therefore are not covered by the disclaimer clause or by a debate over the existence or validity of partial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.843" offset="2374719">Next, what substantive forms of jurisdiction are covered by the disclaimer clause?</text>
            <text syncTime="573.158" offset="2396035">In an 1896 decision, Draper almost contemporaneous with our Enabling Act, this Court held that Enabling Act disclaimers do not encompass the type of criminal and civil jurisdiction envisaged by Public Law 280 at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.700" offset="2462177">Draper arose in Montana which shares the same Enabling Act with Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.204" offset="2492165">These arguments are of course academic because your three previous decisions on the method chosen by Washington to assume jurisdiction under Public Law 280 were correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.940" offset="2535111">This is not to say that we entirely disagree with a basic premise of the Solicitor General in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.891" offset="2566980">We agree with him that the Congress could have required a popular referendum as a prerequisite to assumption of jurisdiction by an Enabling Act state or for that matter, by any other state, if it had wished to do so on 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.565" offset="2625599">We also agree with the Solicitor General that Congressman Westland and others involved in the drafting of Public Law 280 assumed that Washington would be required to amend it's constitution in order to assume jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.624" offset="2681919">But we disagree that those two facts lead to the conclusion advanced by the Solicitor General on the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.361" offset="2712848">They contended that Congress added to a law designed to facilitate the assumption of jurisdiction by the states, an independent federal requirement that a handful of those states do so only by a popular referendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.124" offset="2771884">That haphazard requirement applies under their theory only to eight states in the entire nation but was to apply to them even though no such requirement existed under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.871" offset="2822875">That theory is consistent neither with the goal of Congress in 1953, nor with what it actually said in Public Law 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.888" offset="2854954">Congress' goal in 1953 was to have the states assume jurisdiction over Indian Reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.911" offset="2878986">In the words of the Solicitor General in this case, that goal was, and I quote, “To pull down the reservation fences that kept out state law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="703.531" offset="2917543">We agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.003" offset="2923395">Congress passed Public Law 280 to enable the states to pull those fences down by removing every federal impediment, not to build new fences.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.625" offset="2961847">In fact, some states were required to assume jurisdiction without either legislative or popular approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.399" offset="2989014">Some other states had constitutional amendments tied to their Enabling Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.187" offset="3008136">Those Enabling Act impediments were removed and the Congress authorized the amendment of those state constitutions to which they were tied with two important words as a qualification, and I quote, “where necessary”.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.682" offset="3074069">Obviously, that phrase “where necessary” implies that in some Enabling Act states, a constitutional amendment was not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.374" offset="3112835">The phrase is clearly inconsistent with the contention that the Congress intended to add the requirement of a constitutional amendment as a federal requirement even when no such requirement existed under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.632" offset="3165915">In fact, the counsel for the subcommittee which drafted Public Law 280 explained that that Section 6 granted states permission to amend their statutes or constitutions where state courts deemed to such permission to be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.070" offset="3227669">Still, other states, those in which neither a constitutional nor a statutory amendment was necessary were required to take affirmative legislative action not including a popular referendum to show their willingness to assume the burden of law enforcement on Indian Reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.963" offset="3291199">But the congressional purpose was consistent throughout all three categories of states, to encourage state assumptions, to remove impediments and road blocks, but not to create them.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.653" offset="3341981">In 1959, the Washington Supreme Court decided that no constitutional amendment was necessary and has repeated that conclusion on at least three more occasions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1042.565" offset="4273612">The Congress had listened at length to both the legal and policy arguments of the Yakima's and their supporters on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.269" offset="4300466">Congress knew that Washington's assumption under Public Law 280 was both the most significant and the most controversial of all of the option states, but the Congress consciously and explicitly in 1968 confirmed preexisting assumptions of jurisdiction and obviously meant to include Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.556" offset="4377579">Next, the tribe and the Solicitor General assert that Public Law 280 did not authorize what they characterized as Washington's partial assumption of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.081" offset="4415718">But Washington did not obligate and bind itself to use the terms of the Act to merely partial jurisdiction but to full jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.883" offset="4454902">In fact, it did so twice in 1957 and in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.106" offset="4475800">The Solicitor General quarrels with the manner in which the state assumed the jurisdiction in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.462" offset="4501191">In that year, the state obligated and bound itself to assume full jurisdiction but it did not exercise full jurisdiction on the Yakima Reservation because it made that exercise subject to the consent of the Yakima tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.192" offset="4564093">We did what Public Law 280 required of us even if Public Law 280 required a state commitment to assume full jurisdiction, a requirement which is evident neither on the phase of the statute nor in its legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.584" offset="4621667">By now incidentally, it should be abundantly clear that while the formal position of the tribe and the Solicitor General is that the state exercise is too little jurisdiction, their actual grievance is that it exercises too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.238" offset="4676315">At any rate, the Ninth Circuit not only upheld the 1963 state statute in Quinault, it characterized it as we do as an undertaking to assume full jurisdiction as authorized by Public Law 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.470" offset="4729292">That court also focused on the question of whether or not the state could condition its exercise of full jurisdiction on tribal consent and decided that it could do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.564" offset="4769625">When the Quinault's attempted to bring that decision before this Court in 1967, the Solicitor General filed a brief here agreeing with us that Washington's assumption of jurisdiction was valid even though he characterized it as partial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.972" offset="4823228">The Solicitor General still believes that the phrase “in such manner” in Section 7 of Public Law 280 permitted the state to condition its assumption of jurisdiction in its entirety on tribal consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.561" offset="4885608">We can see nothing in that phrase which forbids state-by-state flexibility in dealing with the extent to which each authorizes a tribal option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.029" offset="4923538">For that matter, the phrase does not seem to bar even a true assumption of only partial jurisdiction, a course which is actually adopted by five option states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.034" offset="4971499">After all, the 1953 Congress wished to facilitate the assumption of jurisdiction by the states and itself provided for a form of partial jurisdiction in all but one of the mandatory states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.816" offset="5026670">It knew less about the situation in the option states while it was actually working in drafting Public Law 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.167" offset="5060002">It's thus difficult to believe that Congress was not willing to permit flexibility in those states and impossible to find such an unwillingness in the language of the statute or in its legislative history.</text>

            <text syncTime="1883.975" offset="7639228">No, they did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.398" offset="7648946">In fact, the state's choice was not only -- not irrational, it was both reasoned and logical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.928" offset="7687084">It tied at the tribal option, the tribal choice of law to Indian lands or the lands under Indian control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.151" offset="7716028">Most non-Indian residents and businesses on the reservation are located on fee land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.287" offset="7740479">Most transactions between Indians and non-Indians like those involved in your cases of Williams versus Lee and Kennerly take place on fee land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.382" offset="7772871">There's no doubt do most Indian claims against non-Indians for consumer fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.280" offset="7796485">Most traffic offenses and minor crimes by both Indians and non-Indians which affect one another in integrated society take place on fee land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.387" offset="7832952">Thus, it was on fee land that the legislature -- with fee land that the legislature was most concerned about establishing a uniformed system of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.767" offset="7866389">Obviously, that concern affected Indian lands as well, especially in the field of traffic offenses and various social programs administered and financed by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.285" offset="7908498">But there, the Indian desire for tribal self-government was a major countervailing consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.804" offset="7934621">So on the classic manner of all legislative bodies, the Washington legislature compromised the demands of those who wanted plenary state jurisdiction everywhere and the tribes who wanted no state jurisdiction anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.651" offset="7990000">The Ninth Circuit panel decision from which this appeal is taken found as a basis for its equal protection holding that a Yakima Indian living on trust land received no law enforcement protection from the state while its Indian neighbor on fee land did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.997" offset="8055411">That is a fatally erroneous view of the effect of the states law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.699" offset="8074219">State law does protect the member of the Yakima tribe on trust land from anyone except a fellow member of the Yakima tribe, and that omission is due solely to the choice which the tribe has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.180" offset="8128136">Even in that situation, the tribal member is treated exactly as a non-Indian on trust land who also lacks state law protection as against the member of the Yakima tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.181" offset="8176097">The distinction is not based on a difference in the need for legal protection by the state but on the state's concern in 1963 for the preservation of a maximum of tribal self-government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.866" offset="8226879">In Antelope less than two years ago, this Court held that the use of land status is the basis for the choice of which criminal law is applicable to an Indian did not constitute a denial of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.717" offset="8278288">It was simply of no consequence that the federal criminal code differed from that of the surrounding state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.409" offset="8300962">In Antelope, that choice of law worked to the detriment of the Indian defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.530" offset="8317471">In this case, it works to the advantage of the Indian who prefers federal or tribal jurisdiction to that of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.739" offset="8346311">And in footnote 13 of Antelope, you recognize that a similar choice of law at question would be involved on almost any military base.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.768" offset="8382464">Actually, scores of military reservations throughout the United States are divided into not two but three types of jurisdiction, exclusive federal, exclusive state, and concurrent jurisdiction, depending on the date and circumstances under which the United States acquired its title.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.110" offset="8455816">That haphazard mixture is apparently of no constitutional significance and in addition to that, it seems to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.072" offset="8483610">There are of course some limits to the tribal option offered by the state even on Indian land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.392" offset="8504926">The eight subjects enumerated in R.C.W. 37.12.010.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.307" offset="8528645">The tribe attacks that form of what it calls partial jurisdiction, as well as the geographical distinctions based on trust status as an unconstitutional deprivation of equal protection and due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.284" offset="8572531">We've already -- I've already discussed the rationale for the state's handling of those eight subjects on trust lands but that same rationale caused the Congress in 1929 and again in 1946 in 25 U.S. Code 231 to authorize the state's partial subject matter jurisdiction on Indian Reservations over health regulations and compulsory school attendance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.096" offset="8663751">And in 1968, the Congress amended Public Law 280 expressly to permit partial subject matter jurisdiction with consent over any subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.306" offset="8704606">By reason of those 1968 amendments to Public Law 280, partial retrocession is also possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.705" offset="8730206">But to the best of our knowledge, no such request for the state legislature has ever been made by the Yakima tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.916" offset="8759045">Clearly, the tools now exist for a flexible approach to state jurisdictions and it is difficult to conceive that they are used to accommodate both Indians and non-Indians either now or in the past would constitute a denial of equal protection or due process to either group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.249" offset="8832397">Finally, the subject matter of this controversy has of course been before the Congress almost continuously for two centuries and will without doubt be considered there again and again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.990" offset="8875342">The Solicitor General and the tribe therefore ask you to frustrate the obvious intention of both the 1953 and the 1968 Congresses and of the Washington State legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.990" offset="8919333">They assert that the practical affect of such a determination would be minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.486" offset="8937305">They can make that assertion only by ignoring reality and by assuming, as the Ninth Circuit panel did, that only the tribe is affected by this controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.241" offset="8980355">The 1963 legislature in contrast with what we believe was a considerable better understanding of the way in which an integrated society actually operates was concerned with the welfare of all its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.137" offset="9031868">It sought a stable legal system which recognized the legitimate aspirations of both Indians and of their non-Indian neighbors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.746" offset="9062379">Instead of wiping out tribal self-government in the jurisdiction field entirely as the Solicitor General believes the state had to do under Public Law 280, the state substantially preserved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.385" offset="9108877">Instead of ignoring the desire of reservation non-Indians for the right to be governed by their own laws, a demand not unfamiliar to those who live in the District of Columbia, the legislature granted that right but not to its maximum extent without the consent of the tribes whose members are also voting citizens of the county and the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.034" offset="9195499">Washington did what it was authorized to do by Public Law 280 and did it well.</text>

            <text syncTime="2400.432" offset="9705096">If I may in the shortness of time turn to the substance of the argument, may I begin in this way?</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.737" offset="9742294">The suggestion has been made that the propositions put from this side of the table frustrate the true intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.972" offset="9783254">I suggest to the Court that far from weaving any fine-spun arguments or erecting any technical obstacles to defeat what everybody knows Congress intended in 1953, we on the contrary are faithful to that congressional intent in 1889, in 1953, in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.552" offset="9873533">That is demonstrable in at least two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.515" offset="9897462">But for Congress' recognition that Washington had what appeared to be an impediment in its state constitution, it is predictable with some assurance that Washington would have been treated as her neighbor Oregon and as four other states, that is, would have been subjected to automatic or mandatory coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.567" offset="9989622">That is because the five states that were so treated in Pubic Law 280 were those where the responsible officials had consulted both the state authorities and the tribes and therefore, the Department of the Interior was in a position to say to Congress, “These states want jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2639.091" offset="10659715">But since here, Congress gave permission to the state to remove this obstacle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.329" offset="10688658">The Coyle problem would seem to disappear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.296" offset="10708511">But my suggestion was, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that -- but for Congress' recognition that Washington like seven other states had impediment in its constitution because it had consulted with the state officials in Washington, and we have Congressman Westland's word for it in the congressional committee that Washington wants to come in on jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.103" offset="10815822">The Indians had been consulted and two of the tribes had indicated their objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.480" offset="10837243">What is more, the Department of Interior indicated that they would at least tentatively recommend exemption of those two tribes, and one of those two tribes is the Yakima tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.085" offset="10879666">So that if Washington had been treated like Oregon, the result would have been that Washington would have been fully covered except only for the Colville and the Yakima Indians who, like the Warm Spring Indians in Oregon, would've been exempted and this problem would never arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.555" offset="10957615">Now, that is how Congress treated ever objecting tribe with respect to whom the Department of the Interior indicated that they had a functioning law and order system, no reason to believe the Yakima wouldn't have been similarly exempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.423" offset="11037027">So we begin there that it's a fluke as it were that the question even arises with respect to the Yakima.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.901" offset="11070986">What is more, and this is conceded by the State of Washington, it is clear that if anybody had walked in on the congressional hearings of this matter in 1953, they would have come away with the conviction that every member sitting thought Washington could not take jurisdiction until and unless it had amended its constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.210" offset="11172237">And for that reason and for that reason alone, Congress wrote Section 6 of Public Law of 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.164" offset="11208077">And not only did it write Section 6, it provided the proviso of a Section 6 as to the effect that jurisdiction under this Act shall not take hold until after the appropriate amendments have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.536" offset="11277563">So the congressional understanding was that Washington would not now be free to assume jurisdiction having failed to take any action to amend its constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3667.810" offset="14774627">In the treaty in 1855, the Yakima Nation was reserved explicitly and implicitly the right to control its internal affairs by its own laws and by its own government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.339" offset="14832724">And for a good number of years, the Yakima Nation exercised that right with responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.684" offset="14858115">A time in 1953, they were exercising that right of control within the exterior boundaries of the reservation with responsibility and Congress, because of other areas of the country were not exercising the responsibility, passed Public Law 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.599" offset="14941811">This Act provided directly for state jurisdiction in five listed states and provided for assumption by statute in ten other states, and in Washington and seven other states provided for assumption of state jurisdiction by the amendment of the state constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.226" offset="15032299">In 1955, in the first legislative session after that act, Washington's -- the proponents of state jurisdiction over Indians tried to get a statutory -- constitutional amendment for the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.120" offset="15087888">They -- they did not amend their constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.829" offset="15102725">In 1957, they provided by legislative act that the tribes who wished jurisdiction could petition for jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.943" offset="15143163">Ten did, others didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.554" offset="15157582">It's interesting to note however that even the tribes who have given it a fair trial and who wished jurisdiction because of their experience they've had for the lack of adequate protection are petitioning this Court in amicus brief to be removed from state jurisdiction in the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.921" offset="15235009">We came to 1963 and unilaterally and without amendment of their state constitution, the State of Washington passed 37.12.010.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.925" offset="15287045">And this Act allowed the state to assume full jurisdiction over non-trust lands and assumed partial jurisdiction over trust lands for eight non-specified or non-defined or non-referred categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.790" offset="15366562">The rest of the jurisdiction over Indians and Indian matters remained with the tribe and with the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.541" offset="15405537">And so we had about four different systems underneath this Act for law enforcement officers to become familiar with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.019" offset="15443466">Now, the result of this unilateral action by the -- on the part of the State of Washington contrary to the treaty promises the Yakima's, has been law without order on the Yakima Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.373" offset="15492890">The record is clear in this case that the system is not adequate to handle the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.035" offset="15515564">The state has admitted that their system is not adequate in two reports into which we referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.515" offset="15541478">And it is particularly, and our biggest problem, it's particularly discriminatory in causing a lot of tribe problems as regards our Indian youth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.955" offset="15579199">The problem is that the state and county have neither the inclination nor ability to provide law and order that they so unilaterally assumed over our objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.811" offset="15626637">Mr. Gorton had his map here and he pointed out the vast area of the Yakima Reservation over 2,000 square miles and there's deeded and non-trust lands sprinkled throughout even in the closed area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.646" offset="15689958">But if you will notice from the record that in 1971, which was the last available figures that were available at that time this case was heard in 1972, the state made two felony arrest outside of the cities and towns, often this vast areas and 17 misdemeanor arrests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.300" offset="15796537">Unfortunately gentlemen, the Reservation law and order system under Washington system does not either meet any national standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.841" offset="15842722">It doesn't meet any parity statewide standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.707" offset="15854216">Sure, we have as good at reservation -- a good law and order as they do in some other bad parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3943.526" offset="15877517">It has no parity with cities and it has no parity if you please with other parts to the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="3952.521" offset="15913462">If you'll notice that while they're talking about 40 deputies assigned to the county today, at the time of the trial there were 29 and even though the whole area of the county is only 4,700 square miles, only two were principally assigned to the reservation, which is over half that area, and only seven were assigned to the entire lower valley which has a bigger population than the rest of the rural area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.057" offset="16035610">Now, what has happened here is been a decline of arrests of over 2000% above and beyond the time when the Indians were -- that was any Federal Government was handling the responsibility and the juvenile situation is a scandal, and that's our biggest problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4002.236" offset="16112306">Washington in its reports agrees to the lack of adequacy, if you'll see in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4011.046" offset="16147519">And the county officials, particularly in the testimony were particularly agreed that it was discriminatory, that there was more factors available for non-Indian youth than there was for Indian youth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4024.211" offset="16200182">Now, if there is to -- going to be law and order in the Yakima Reservation, we must regain our law and order and we're here today to see whether underneath the law, it is ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.086" offset="16255666">The Yakima's throughout all this time and are today been very responsible on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.728" offset="16274265">In spite of the unwarranted intrusions into their jurisdiction, they're spending per capita, spending per capita for each and every member more for law and order than any other community in the United States, even though they have not got the total responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="4061.477" offset="16349288">Washington as I said in contrast refers to meet any -- refuses to meet any reasonable standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="4068.701" offset="16378128">Now, as I understand my duty to this Court, it is first my duty to indicate to this Court why I believe that 37.12.010 should not pertain to the Yakima Indian nation before I get into the constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4086.898" offset="16450957">Now, I think that can be easily demonstrated, gentlemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4090.264" offset="16464436">Undis -- it is undisputed by all the parties here that the treaty with the Yakima's explicitly and implicitly reserved the Yakima powers over their internal affairs to be governed by their own laws and by their own government.</text>

            <text syncTime="5107.443" offset="20533164">And the Circuit Court said that that provision was not equal protection and therefore, that portion of the Section under 1963 would be stricken as unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="5121.478" offset="20589275">Now, I think the Court was very clear on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5125.711" offset="20606203">They didn't go into whether there would be strict scrutiny or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="5131.164" offset="20628041">I want to point out to the court however that the rational basis that the state has come up here at this very late date is a very -– is new, never been brought into this case before, and is inconsistent from their present position and inconsistent with their position before this Court in Docket 78-119.</text>
            <text syncTime="5153.570" offset="20717693">In that case, in the fishing matters, the Supreme Court of the State of Washington is saying that in regards to Indians and non-Indians, that there are -- in regards to the treaty rights that there can be no differentiation or it's a violation of equal protection of both state and federal constitution there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5174.508" offset="20801390">So, the state is trying to have it this way in this case and the other way in the other case and it's certainly a new rationale that they came up with.</text>
            <text syncTime="5183.216" offset="20836185">I would like to have the court consider also in this matter that strict scrutiny should apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="5198.595" offset="20897729">And certainly, the rights involved, the rights, the protection of person and property are most fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="5205.093" offset="20923747">And if it's necessary, I would like to have the court give that consideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="5436.427" offset="21849109">Actually, that police confusion is practically non-existent because the tribal code is practically identical in all of its definitions to the State Criminal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="5447.321" offset="21892681">That's simply a practical matter, however.</text>
            <text syncTime="5449.845" offset="21902712">The other matter which really amounted to retrying his case, which Mr. Hovis stated here even though he did not prevail on the trial court, has to do with his outrageous use of arrest figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="5462.009" offset="21951404">And Mr. Justice Stevens really answered that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5466.722" offset="21970213">What has happened Mr. Justice Stevens is that those arrests now are being made by the tribal police under their deputization from the county sheriff.</text>
            <text syncTime="5477.324" offset="22012635">The same number of people are being arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="5478.955" offset="22019218">They aren't being arrested by the Deputy Sheriff and I mean a Deputy Sheriff because the tribe keeps us off of two-thirds, you know, has closed to two-thirds of the reservation to entry by non-Indians.</text>

            <text syncTime="5489.674" offset="22062059">But what if the tribal policeman is acting as a county deputy sheriff, wouldn't the arrest figures show that the arrest was made by a deputy sheriff?</text>

            <text syncTime="5498.232" offset="22096332">No, the arrest figures that were given there were arrest figures by the county sheriff.</text>

            <label>Mr. Slade Gorton</label>
            <text syncTime="5504.344" offset="22120782">Not -- not by anyone else, not by the state patrol, which among other things have four times as many arrests as the county sheriff did, and which is also cross-deputized by the tribal police.</text>
            <text syncTime="5517.368" offset="22172818">Now, back to the submission of the Solicitor General in this matter, the Solicitor General wishes that the phrase “where necessary” were not in the statute and it would make his case a great deal easier and mind a great deal -- more difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="5537.655" offset="22254007">But he so -- he says, “Well, maybe it just is a reference to the fact that these are disclaimer states or maybe it applies only to statutes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5546.113" offset="22287862">But of course, it doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="5547.346" offset="22292773">That phrase appears right after the word “amend”, to amend where necessary its constitution or statutes, and what it means is quite obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="5557.124" offset="22331852">It means that the state determines under state law whether it's necessary to amend a constitution or a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5563.991" offset="22359333">If it is not necessary under state law, the state is a Section 7 rather than a Section 6 state.</text>
            <text syncTime="5571.391" offset="22388903">Congress was not interested in building up extra fences making additional federal requirements which didn't pre-exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="5581.921" offset="22431013">I simply wish to go back to the point which I made a great deal of the Solicitor General's brief has to do with the fact that this requirement of a vote by the people was made way back in 1889.</text>
            <text syncTime="5593.274" offset="22476466">But when in 1889, South Dakota said, “No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="5597.604" offset="22493811">It's not by the people.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5599.416" offset="22501021">The President of the United States accepted that as total compliance with the same Enabling Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5606.328" offset="22528711">South Dakota, Washington, Montana were admitted pursuant to the same Enabling Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5611.054" offset="22547623">That debate actually was all over South Dakota in its -- or Dakota at its division into two separate states.</text>
            <text syncTime="5619.853" offset="22582836">40 states in the country, 35 states rather, very clearly have neither Enabling Acts nor were required to take jurisdiction on a mandatory basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5632.032" offset="22631528">Yet, they were given the choice to determine under state law what jurisdiction they wish to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="5638.699" offset="22658173">The problem with this entire argument, we would be here before you -- we would not be here before you at all because of the fact that you have already decided the Enabling Act question, except for the fact that we were more considerate of the tribal desire for self-government than was any other state that dealt with Public Law 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="5660.248" offset="22744377">Their argument is you could give the tribes that option; is what it amounts to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5667.792" offset="22774575">We took full jurisdiction, Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="5671.720" offset="22790248">We exercised full jurisdiction over everything that was covered by the Enabling Act even when the Enabling Act was in full effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5680.891" offset="22826924">Fee lands as I've said earlier in an argument that was not answered here, fee lands are not covered by the Enabling Act at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5690.637" offset="22865899">And over them, we took full jurisdiction on those lands in which the Indians have the greatest interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5696.730" offset="22890245">The ones which they own or which are held in trust for them, we deferred to them, to the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="5703.397" offset="22916995">We agreed --</text>
