            <label>Mr. Edward J. Nowak</label>
            <text syncTime="16.895" offset="170924">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.863" offset="186807">This case directly puts in issue the rights of our citizens to be free from arrest or seizures for purposes of police investigation without probable cause under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of our constitution, and as applied by this Court in 1975 to the case of Brown versus Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.876" offset="270921">This case may also present a further issue, because if this case is not decided in accordance with Brown versus Illinois, then this Court will be faced with resolving the issue of the importance of the -- or the important right of our citizens to be free from unreasonable seizures for purposes of investigative detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.596" offset="353782">A question that was left open by this Court in Terry versus Ohio and again left open in Morales versus New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.762" offset="390457">If I may briefly outline the facts, there was a murder in the City of Rochester at a pizza parlor, March 26 of 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.770" offset="426402">The proprietor of that establishment was fatally wounded during the course of an attempted robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.219" offset="460257">The next fact that we have from the record, we do not know what the police did from the record between March 26 and August 10, but we know that on August 10, the police received information from an inmate who was incarcerated in the Monroe County Jail whom they had never used before, who was never established in this record as having been reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.949" offset="547192">They received information from this Mr. Sparrow, indicating that a Mr. Cole and a Mr. Irving Axlerod committed this particular murder at the pizza parlor.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.889" offset="594944">At that point in time, the police officer who was in the jail called the lieutenant in charge of the criminal investigation of the physical crime squad.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.555" offset="633605">The lieutenant came down to the police headquarters at about 8 o'clock at night, and he questioned Mr. Sparrow and he asked Sparrow where he got his information.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.799" offset="666520">How did he come about knowing this?</text>
            <text syncTime="142.634" offset="673938">Sparrow indicated that Cole told he did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.025" offset="691493">The police had then went and confronted Cole who at that time was also incarcerated in the Monroe County Jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.331" offset="720645">After two hours of questioning, Cole persisted and denied any involvement whatsoever in this homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.218" offset="748231">He said, “I had nothing to do with it, but I'll tell you who did, I didn't do it but Irving Axlerod did it with another guy called Ba Ba Adams.”</text>
            <text syncTime="172.922" offset="795042">The police at that point said, “Who told you this Mr. Cole?” “Somebody else, Adam's brother a guy named Hubert Adams.”</text>
            <text syncTime="181.448" offset="829210">“Well where is Hubert Adams?”</text>
            <text syncTime="183.888" offset="838928">“He's in the Elmira Correctional Facility”, which is about 90 miles south of Rochester.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.145" offset="859930">What did the police do?</text>
            <text syncTime="191.085" offset="867662">Again, I'd like to emphasize that Mr. Cole is a person charged with a crime, never having been used at all in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.373" offset="896815">His reliability has never been established.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.103" offset="907786">And while his reliability had never been established, he is denying that he was involved in this crime which is the original information that they got that he was involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="531.442" offset="2229164">And the testimony in this case, which is crucial, is that Mr. Dunaway asked the police in the police car while going downtown, “Why do we have to go downtown?”</text>
            <text syncTime="539.730" offset="2262288">And the police said, “You'll find out when we get there.”</text>
            <text syncTime="542.823" offset="2274617">Now I think that that type of a request indicates that the police had seized this individual and in fact had arrested him.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.769" offset="2302412">At this point in time, they didn't answer his direct request to find out why they had to go downtown.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.703" offset="2326235">And the record, I think, is also clear that there was an objection to one of the questions about putting emphasis, counselor on the word “had” and the court said, “Objection overruled, the officer knows what were driving at” and the officers says, “Well, if I remember correctly, that's what he said, why do we have to go downtown.”</text>
            <text syncTime="569.856" offset="2382764">And so I think that the state of the mind of this defendant is clear that he felt he was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.986" offset="2399274">It's also clear from the stipulation on the record that the people who stipulated the -- officers when they went out intended to arrested because the officers many times had said, “When we have a warrant of arrest, our directive is to pick them up and bring them in.”</text>

            <text syncTime="985.092" offset="4043734">The purpose or the flagrancy of this conduct -- what is flagrant official misconduct, I guess is the real question.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.173" offset="4068080">And I think in the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Powell in Brown versus Illinois, he said, that there are three types or three examples he gave of official flagrant and misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.702" offset="4106219">The first is when the police clearly act without probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.286" offset="4120534">The second is when they make a pretext arrest and thirdly, when they go in with arms, weapons drawn without probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.689" offset="4158151">And he cites those three examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.500" offset="4165360">Clearly Brown fell within example three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.424" offset="4173093">He was accosted at gun point in his own home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.840" offset="4190751">Example three does not apply to this case and therefore the people say there's no flagrancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.617" offset="4205798">But if you look at Mr. Justice Powell's concurring opinion, he says that the first example he gives is when they make an arrest without probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.839" offset="4238712">In this case they conceded that they didn't have probable cause, they were directly asked by the defense attorney on cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.069" offset="4271626">They said, “Did you have probable cause to get a warrant or did you go get a warrant?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.931" offset="4291062">And he said, “I didn't go get a warrant because I knew I didn't have probable cause to get one.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.720" offset="4306213">Yet knowing this they went to his house and seized him, and I submit to you as the dissent at the appellate division clearly stated this constitutes flagrant official misconduct when the police know they don't have probable cause and they act without it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.080" offset="4363682">And I think that this is a flagrant misuse of official misconduct and the exact purpose of the exclusionary rule as it was used in Brown would be served again by applying it in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1677.432" offset="6813132">He really knew nothing about what they were doing, they told him, “Well, we got to go hear” and they said, “By the way, let us stop off and see if this guy Dunaway is home.</text>

            <text syncTime="1973.593" offset="7997733">There was a split, there was a four to one, one dissent, three concurrences on the Morales theory and the Brown theory and a concurring opinion on Morales only, that was Justice Denman.</text>

            <text syncTime="1998.479" offset="8097311">On two grounds, in the first place, as they already tried to indicate, there would be no deterrent effect if the police reasonably believe they are following the law as it exists, and the testimony of the officer on the stand clearly indicates that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.854" offset="8150810">I think as a matter of fact I have it, it's at -- it's on our brief at page 27 and in the appendix at page 61.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.004" offset="8175365">The officer said, he had “the right to take him downtown, I did not have probable cause to arrest him, I did have his words probable cause to take him downtown” which was his way of saying reasonable suspicion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2042.492" offset="8273377">Now speaking strictly to the question of attenuation, if I understand Brown correctly, that too is a balance of a different sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.826" offset="8314650">The extent of the necessary attenuation to separate the statement from the presumed illegality is always a question of fact, if I'm correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.844" offset="8354774">That I am suggesting that under strict Brown -- strictly under the theory espoused in Brown, the good faith of the officers, the minimum take, the lack of exploitation, the clearly voluntary nature of the statement itself shows that there was a separation in his mind when he made the statement as opposed to when he was arrested, assuming again that there was an illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.996" offset="8455398">There's a separate matter which I ask the court to consider as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.859" offset="8474833">Originally, after Brown after the defendant Dunaway made his first statement, the police officer left.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.466" offset="8509210">Late that afternoon or early evening according to the testimony which was accepted, he asked to see the officers again and they came back late in -- later in the evening 9 or 10 o'clock after their tour of duty had long -- was long over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.236" offset="8556335">And he said something like, it's in the record, he said something like, “Look, I didn't give you the whole story before I want to make it clean, the rest of it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.851" offset="8578800">And he gave them a much more detailed statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.816" offset="8586637">Now he started to name names and he cleaned up some of the things he had told them before which weren't altogether accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.403" offset="8612968">At trial there was a preliminary hearing, a hunt -- we call it a Huntley Hearing, a pretrial suppression hearing, at which both statements were ruled admissible, however it was a joint trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.064" offset="8659675">And since the second statement had the names of the other defendants, there were Bruton problems, the trial attorney decided he didn't need the second statement, the first one was all he did need which and he proved himself correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.828" offset="8706696">He therefore never used it, but I would also suggest the fact of that second statement being absolutely voluntary to pure essence since the defendant called the police, should also be considered on the attenuation theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.989" offset="8763329">Now with respect to what facts -- some questions arose as to what happened, I think maybe I should spend a minute or two detailing what the New York rules are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.197" offset="8800110">The appellate division can find facts -- the intermediate appellate courts in the State of New York can find facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.452" offset="8821217">Ordinarily, the highest court, the Court of Appeals cannot, they're a court limited to questions of law only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.066" offset="8843682">In this case, I suggest that a fair reading of the opinion shows that the appellate division did find facts, and the facts that they found fully credited the police testimony to the extent that there was any conflict.</text>

            <text syncTime="2442.073" offset="9871653">They had reached an impasse and the Court of Appeals tried to strike a balance and the balance that they sought to strike was that where in a narrow class of cases, a very narrow class of cases, the police can demonstrate, they can articulate that they have reached an impasse in their investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.779" offset="9950438">But that they have reasonable suspicion which is a step below probable cause to suspect that one or more individuals either has information about the crime or may be a defendant that is a perpetrator.</text>

            <text syncTime="2761.141" offset="11147891">I think the real knob of the question is this, if the police want to investigate this matter and they have reasonable suspicion to believe that a certain individual knows something about the crime, what they want is an exchange of ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.723" offset="11210271">They want communication, you can't -- if you stop people on a street, unfortunately in our society in certain parts of town all you'll going to get is an argument in a crowd.</text>

            <text syncTime="2854.230" offset="11520293">In the first place the information that they had gave them no direct evidence concerning Dunaway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.098" offset="11543803">If they credit Cole's testimony, Coles statement, Cole heard from Hubert was the co-defended Ronald Ba Ba's brother, his older brother.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.659" offset="11582046">The information they got from him was that maybe a direct statement had been made to the brother but not direct statement had been made by Dunaway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.831" offset="11614647">The would just have another layer of hearsay to contend with no matter what Hubert Adams told in Elmira, they still had to go talk to Dunaway and they would be in no better position than they were before they left.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.860" offset="11666787">Second of all, when you have someone who is -- who might arguably want to protect his own brother more so than he might want to protect Dunaway who is not his brother, anything that he said, anything that Adam said, is immediately suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.150" offset="11735960">He might promise them anything either to get his brother off the hook or to get a better deal for himself or a better jail assignment or parole time or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.356" offset="11764799">It seems to me they made a practical decision, and of course Ba Ba was a juvenile and I don't think they knew where he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.815" offset="11790608">My recollection of the record is that they were looking for him too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.125" offset="11803878">It was just coincidence that they found Dunaway first within a day or so.</text>

            <text syncTime="3515.498" offset="14165347">And that's what the respondent here is trying to urge that they can go to Cole on reasonable suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.119" offset="14187813">They can question him and make him prove his innocence, but they don't have probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.515" offset="14205471">They can make our citizens prove because it's a murder case, it's serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.273" offset="14224488">They can make our citizens prove by detaining them and questioning they didn't do it, and that's reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.984" offset="14243297">And I submit that it is not reasonable that before we can compel our citizens and be interrogated which is the greatest form of deprivation of liberty in police headquarters, probable cause is required, and that should be clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.560" offset="14293661">And I think that the New York rule should be definitely overturned in this case.</text>
