            <label>Mr. Eugene K. Connors</label>
            <text syncTime="60.711" offset="346258">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.791" offset="358588">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.009" offset="383457">This case was brought under two federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.021" offset="395473">The first statute is Title 42 U.S. Code Section 1985 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="80.368" offset="424835">Previously it was codified as 42 U.S.C. 1985 (3) but it's more popularly known as the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 passed on April 20th of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.057" offset="479587">The second federal statute under which the suit is brought is Section 704 (a) the so-called retaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.778" offset="522533">It's a suit brought by a person named John Novotny, a former second ranking official in the Pittsburg, Pennsylvania Savings and Loan Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.252" offset="556387">It was brought against the association and its individual officers and directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.161" offset="580002">The facts alleged are that the association and its individual officers and directors discriminated against women in promotions and other aspects of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.808" offset="618559">Mr. Novotny allegedly protested against this at a board of directors meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.200" offset="640188">His Title VII cause of action is grounded upon the allegation that his subsequent discharge resulted from his protest at the board of directors meeting and therefore was opposition against a practice made unlawful within the meaning of Section 704 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="151.618" offset="709883">That cause of action incidentally was brought against both the association and the individual officers and directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.812" offset="738617">The 1985 (3) cause of action is grounded upon the allegation that the individual officers and directors acting at all times on behalf of the association conspired to deprive women of their Title VII rights and they acted further into the conspiracy was Mr. Novotny's discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.013" offset="807476">A motion to dismiss in the district court was filed and granted as to both causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.902" offset="830986">The Third Circuit however sitting en banc reversed this to both causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.634" offset="849899">Certiorari was sought and granted only on the 1985 (3) cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.875" offset="874872">Therefore, Mr. Novotny's Title VII retaliation cause of action against both the association and the individuals will survive irrespective of the outcome in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.169" offset="916041">The issues as we see them are three, whether a depravation of Title VII rights is a depravation of equal privileges and immunities under the laws within the meaning of 1985 (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="214.186" offset="960136">Secondly, whether agents of a corporation acting only on the corporation's behalf can conspire within the meaning of 1985 (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="224.584" offset="1001723">And thirdly and lastly, whether the Congress under 1985 (3) intended to reach sex discrimination in private employment through the Commerce Clause or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.357" offset="1060760">The language in 1985 (3) material to this case grants a federal remedy when two or more persons conspire for the purpose of depriving a class of persons of equal privileges and immunities under the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.388" offset="1120946">It grants this civil cause of action to a person injured in his person or property were deprived of any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.448" offset="1165145">Moving to our first issue to determine whether Title VII grants equal privileges under the laws, we believe it's most appropriate to see what the effect of the Third Circuit's opinion is on the workings of Title VII which is the right allegedly being asserted under 1985 (3) here.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.518" offset="1241422">Through Title VII, Congress has created certain rights to be free from discrimination in private employment including for the first time effective July 2, 1965 sex discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.172" offset="1296071">At the same time, Congress created what in Section 706 is the exclusive procedure for asserting and enforcing this Title VII created rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.843" offset="1338702">According to Mr. Novotny and the Third Circuit however, 1985 (3) made Title VII's administrative judicial procedures permissive at the very moment of its creation.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.355" offset="1396799">A person deprived of any Title VII right whatsoever can bypass Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.322" offset="1420622">Congress has carefully designed, carefully thought out administrative judicial framework with its emphasis on conciliation and with specific time limits, deferral, provisions, all can be very easily subverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.010" offset="1483421">The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or a state fair employment practice agency, the agencies charged by the Congress with expertise in these matters that are supposed to take a very active role in conciliation and persuasion within the framework at the administrative processes in Title VII can be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.404" offset="1565027">Alternatively of course, a person under the Third Circuit's reading of 1985 (3) can proceed through the administrative processes of Title VII and ultimately perhaps the federal court and at the same time proceed immediately to federal court under 1985 (3) creating a very real possibility of conflicting erroneous inconsistent decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.007" offset="1671398">This situation is different from what this Court decided in the Johnson versus Railway Express case.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.888" offset="1698879">Johnson involved a preexisting independent right to sue under Section 1981 of Title 42.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.905" offset="1739003">In this case, we're talking about 1985 (3) being read to take a right created by Title VII and thereby invalidate the administrative processes under which that Title VII created right was to be asserted and enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.884" offset="1826879">In addition, despite the Third Circuit's disclaimer that 1985 (3) would not apply to anything beyond equal employment opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.417" offset="1865017">There's no holding back the thrust of the Third Circuit's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.802" offset="1882572">The thrust -- the logical trust of that opinion is to extend 1985 (3) to any federal substantive statute irrespective of whether such a statute has it's own administrative framework and irrespective of whether Congress decided and designed it to be handled exclusively through it's own administrative processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.944" offset="1975150">We would have in this Court and other courts a needless flood of duplicative litigation under such laws as the National Labor Relations Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Equal Pay Act, the Labor Management Reporting a Disclosure Act, the Age Discrimination Employment Act, and we can multiply that by 10's and 20's and 30's and 40's.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.218" offset="2084237">In our view however, that chaotic unreasonable result is unnecessary because --</text>

            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="569.834" offset="2382660">We realize the opinions here but we're passing on the judgments only.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eugene K. Connors</label>
            <text syncTime="573.818" offset="2398647">I understand, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.941" offset="2411186">We believe however that the chaos is unnecessary and the unreasonable result is unnecessary because the legislative history makes clear and the draftsmen and sponsors of 1985 (3) made clear that 1985 (3) is a remedial statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.651" offset="2486000">In fact, the Third Circuit specifically quoted from both Senator Edmunds who was the floor manager in the Senate for 1985 (3), then of course the Ku Klux Klan Act and also Representative Shellabarger.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.989" offset="2543365">The Third Circuit quotes from these two individuals appear at pages 27-A and 29-A of the Court's opinion as reproduced in the cert petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.527" offset="2585475">1985 (3) does not stand on its own, it needs a right from another source.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.336" offset="2616717">It's a remedy in search of a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.961" offset="2627166">For that reason, it's unlike such laws as 1981 or Title VII which are substantive statutes combining both a right remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.530" offset="2669484">And that is the distinction between 1985 (3) and for instance 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.709" offset="2694248">Admittedly, the phrase laws in 1985 (3) appears all inclusive but the legislative history makes clear that Congress was creating a federal remedy and a federal form to assert rights, federal rights where none previously existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.690" offset="2774183">It was a need filling statute the Ku Klux Klan Act was finally passed in 1871 by the Congress because Congress learned from painful experience that it wasn't enough to just create laws -- create rights under for instance the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth Amendments saying that citizens had certain rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.141" offset="2871986">The states and private individuals is recognized in the Griffin case who are unable or who are unwilling to protect and respect such naked rights, unassertable rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.693" offset="2922141">Under 1985 (3), Congress made for the first time such previously unassertable rights assertable in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.700" offset="2962160">1985 (3) was and therefore is a gap filling statute to fulfill a particular need.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.028" offset="2987447">It wasn't designed to supplant or replace other carefully thought-out legislation which stands on its own like Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.827" offset="3030706">It was meant to apply where an existing remedy if it did not exist or was not being enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.171" offset="3068008">Additionally, in 1985 (3) the phrase “equal privileges” is mentioned, equal privileges and immunities under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.084" offset="3107715">We're talking here about sex discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.488" offset="3121298">Not every citizen has a federal right to be free from employment discrimination under Title VII and that's the right we're talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.879" offset="3158915">For instance only employees who are employed by employers employing 15 or more individuals have a federal right to be free from sex discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.916" offset="3215026">In other words, since not every citizen has a right -- a federal right to be free from sex discrimination, in our view, freedom from sex discrimination is not in equal with the acts on equal privilege and immunity because it isn't extended to each and every citizen.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="798.030" offset="3295483">Well, wouldn't the Third Circuit's answer to that be that with respect to all persons employed by employers are 15 or more persons, it is a right to equal treatment?</text>

            <text syncTime="808.977" offset="3339264">The Third Circuit may well say that but if we go a little bit farther in the language of the statute it says in order to assert a civil cause of action under 1985 (3), a person must be injured in his person, in his property, or deprived of a right of national citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.051" offset="3415542">And I submit that you do not have a right of national citizenship to be free from sex discrimination since all citizens do not have that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.386" offset="3468936">Griffin recognized the possibility that courts could read 1985 (3) to be the (Inaudible) it was not and caution against reading 1985 (3) as a general federal tort law.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.143" offset="3539989">We believe that Third Circuit's overbroad analysis and construction of 1985 (3) creates a general federal tort law despite the language in for instance Griffin which talks about having to establish under 1985 (3) and invidiously discriminatory class-based animus.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.656" offset="3622013">We submit that whenever you violate Title VII you automatically have class-based animus because we have created, Congress has created certain protected classes such as sex, national origin race, etcetera under Title VII to automatically would have class-based discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.510" offset="3713442">Invidiously discriminatory, I'm not sure exactly what that means.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.263" offset="3732459">I do know from the Screws case and from the footnote in the Griffin case that it does not mean specific intent, so it means something less and it may very well mean something as simple to prove and automatically approve as people intended the logical consequences of their action.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.918" offset="3823052">And thirdly, since we're dealing here with a corporation I submit -- but it doesn't make any difference whether it's a corporation or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.291" offset="3860564">I would submit it virtually every decision to discharge somebody, not to hire someone has a legal plurality of personalities involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.637" offset="3921899">In other words, at least two people have had input into that situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1741.047" offset="7067564">As we've pointed out, to determine what a corporate -- moving to our second issues since I see my time is fast moving.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.407" offset="7113017">To determine whether a corporate agent is acting on the corporation's behalf can conspire under 1985 (3), we must recognize first of all how our corporation really acts exclusively through its agents incapable of acting without them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.291" offset="7172577">That's why a corporation is only one person under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.646" offset="7185951">Next we must see if under 1985 (3) there's any need to disregard how a corporation really acts and we say there is no need for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.239" offset="7224299">First, because under Title VII the corporate veil can be pierced in the classic sense where a corporation is a shell without assets or erected for an unlawful purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.670" offset="7266095">Also under Title VII, an agent can be held individually liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.652" offset="7285948">In fact, the Solicitor General has cited a few cases in his brief to that effect and that's taken from the definition of Section 701 (b) which defines an employer as a corporation and any of its agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.146" offset="7335999">Under principles of tort, agents can be held individually liable as joint tortfeasors through principles of respondeat superior, a corporation and its agents are already exposed to liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.848" offset="7386781">Much as individual conspirators are exposed to liability in a civil conspiracy context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.481" offset="7413321">We say there isn't any need to punish, to get out and punish the conspirators because this 1985 (3) creates a civil conspiracy and it's only a criminal conspiracy that is out to punish individual conspirators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.872" offset="7474866">That's the job of Section 241 of Title 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.201" offset="7492211">We also say that to rule it otherwise and to say that a corporation can conspire with its agents could very easily show collect of action.The very life blood of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.424" offset="7533066">And finally, the Dictionary Act which was passed on February 25, of 1871 near days before 1985 (3) was drafted, defined the word person to include the corporation as noted in this Court's Monell decision to include a corporation within the framework of the definition person unless the contacts to the statute clearly indicates a more limited definition.</text>

            <text syncTime="2915.696" offset="11766157">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.582" offset="11785697">It is the position of the United States and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in this Court that eight years ago, this Court after a careful review of the legislative history of what is now 1985 (c) in the latest edition of Title 42 restored that statute to its proper role in civil rights enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.540" offset="11901576">And that the Court of Appeals in this case properly extended the principles of the Griffin decision in a manner that is compatible with the Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.285" offset="11956537">As we understand the basic principle of Griffin against Breckenridge it's that 1985 (c) serves as a remedy for aggravated cases of the violation of other federal rights in which aggravated cases in which a number of individuals sharing a class based discriminatory animus join in scheme to deprive a person or persons of their rights under federal law and therefore denied him equal protection of the federal law equal rights and privileges under the laws in the words of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.589" offset="12157680">And that is the kind of claim as the Court of Appeals construed the complaint here that was raised in this case and no question has been put to this Court about the Court of Appeals construction of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.366" offset="12216822">Nor has any question been raised about what the Court of Appeals has decided under Title VII in the case thus far although we noted on page 27 of our brief in footnote 16 that the petitioners have resolved the possibility of asserting a defense for the individual directors under Title VII based on the fact that they were not named in the original Title VII charge individually.</text>

            <text syncTime="3112.932" offset="12555055">The question had been raised about why did the petitioners bring only the 1985 claim here and this is one factor that was not mentioned in previous discussions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.739" offset="12610330">The Court of Appeals had to reach some issues that the court -- that this Court in Griffin did not find it necessary to reach in order to decide the case and a number of those have not been presented in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.585" offset="12673755">There is no claim made in this Court that the Court of Appeals aired in construing 1985 (c) as extending to class-based deprivations other than racial deprivations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.596" offset="12737808">The Court of Appeals dealt with that issue correctly in our view but the question as we see it is not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.259" offset="12768423">Although what the case does present to the Court is the question whether the kind of supplemental remedy that Section 1981 provides under this Court's unanimous decision in Johnson against Railway Express on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.073" offset="12843656">That kind of supplemental remedy in racial cases under Title VII will also exist in sex discrimination cases under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.151" offset="12891930">Oh, that's one way of looking at the question that's presented here because 1981 addresses only racial discrimination and the other classes protected by Title VII have to look to 1985 (c).</text>

            <text syncTime="3663.903" offset="14758954">It is not more complex than that Mr. Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3667.965" offset="14775254">Mr. Wallace, it's certainly a pattern in the business life of this country and that's carried over into the Government of this country and right into this Court, that most of the secretaries of the justices and the presidents of corporations and congressmen are women.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.636" offset="14849964">Now would that be the kind of shared purpose or some way, are all these people disfavoring men because we have found that at least we think we have found that women are more dexterous, they do a lot of things better than men do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.309" offset="14920600">So, I think for years and years there is two or three exceptions over this century all the secretaries of justices on this Court have been women.</text>
