            <label>Mr. John E. Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="57.009" offset="331421">The outline of my argument points this morning would be first of all, I'd like to classify the Eighth Circuit opinion as it may as one of policy contrary to the warnings of this Court in antitrust decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.957" offset="387218">Secondly, we look at the statute language exactly what it does say which I say is in the disjunctive.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.774" offset="414490">Then, I would like to go to the opinions of this Court starting with Mr. Justice Holmes in Chattanooga Foundry through Mr. Justice Marshall and Hawaii versus Standard Oil, and in through each one of the Justices here what they said in Pfizer versus Government of India.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.058" offset="479587">Lastly, I would then like to describe if I may for the Court, what I see the result of the Eighth Circuit's opinion being which is -- severely added complication to the antitrust laws, the destruction of the parens patriae legislation, both for the states and the private opt out provision in that legislation, and finally, the elevation of foreign governments to a preferred position over American citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.576" offset="589720">First of all policy, I think if we look at the Eighth Circuit opinion, it concludes we think it sensible as a matter of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.491" offset="617305">To me, this is indirect conflict with this Court's warning in U.S. v. Cooper Corporation where this Court said it is not for the courts to indulge in the business of policy making in the field of antitrust legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.370" offset="672893">This Court has said many times Saint Paul Fire and Marine case and Blue Shield of Texas, so forth that the starting point in any case involving a statute language is the statute language itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.152" offset="720018">Let's look at that, Section 4 of the Clayton Act reads, any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust law shall recover, is the business or property --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="168.732" stopTime="178.357">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="168.732" offset="778324">Mr. Thomas, if you -- why didn't the Congress simply say any person injured rather than injured in his business or property?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_e_thomas" startTime="178.357" stopTime="500.593">
            <label>Mr. John E. Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="178.357" offset="816776">Well, Your Honor, that Senator Hoar's Section 7 amendment I guess to Senator Sherman's initial proposal, and at that time, Senator which I believe did basically read that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.137" offset="871946">Senator Hoar said there is no change.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.090" offset="879783">It was well understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.885" offset="886888">His amendment has change to business or property.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.707" offset="898173">So I would say that it reads the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.709" offset="918235">The dictionary, Black's Law Dictionary of course says or is in the disjunctive and Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I will touch back on that a little more directly, I'm coming to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.454" offset="957210">Legal scholars, all of them who have touch on this, who have considered this question, all of them, through Professor Sullivan, Professor Bork, all of them say that it's in the disjunctive business or property and the consumers has standing to recover from money paid for price-fixed goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.766" offset="1022412">Professor Sullivan says that Mr. Justice Holmes noted it was in the disjunctive.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.571" offset="1041638">Judge Wyzanski in referring to this Court said that Congress and the courts have frequently shown their regard to Sherman Act as an economic charter of freedom of hardly less than constitutional dimensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.808" offset="1094614">It deserves ungrudging and as sometime said liberal reading to accomplish its purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.138" offset="1115930">Now, this Court in Pfizer versus India where Mr. Justice Stewart wrote the majority opinion with Justices Brennan, White, Marshall, and Stevens said this, the petitioner's argued that the antitrust laws were intended to protect only American consumers, and those Justices who here this morning said concluded clearly therefore, Congress did not intend to make the treble-damage remedy, and I'm going to hammer on that term remedy, available only to consumers in our country.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.067" offset="1263679">That was what the majority said.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.893" offset="1274964">The dissent lead by or written by Mr. Chief Justice Burger with Justices Powell and Rehnquist said this, as this Court observed last term, the legislative history, the treble-damage remedy which does exist quoting form Brunswick now indicates that it was conceived of primarily as a remedy for the people of the United States as individuals, especially consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.039" offset="1379558">And then, this is the language of that three judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.786" offset="1390529">It said, what we so recently saw as primarily a remedy for American consumers is now extended all nations of the world, and that was the cause for the dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.318" offset="1432639">Mr. Justice Powell who wrote a separate dissent noted this all important case of Georgia v. Evans where the State of Georgia by the asphalt for its roads was a consumer?</text>
            <text syncTime="343.293" offset="1476524">And Mr. Justice Powell apparently saw no direct legislative history but he said this, in Georgia v. Evans, a clear policy to protect the states of the union was reflected and the antitrust laws and in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.703" offset="1530232">The court could perceive no reason for believing that Congress wanted to deprive a state such to consumer here as purchaser of commodity shipped in interstate commerce of the civil remedy, there is that term remedy again, of treble-damages which is available to other purchasers who suffer through violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.952" offset="1611212">Those are the words of all the Justices here, those three.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.735" offset="1626363">Now, remedy, come back to that term remedy, legislative history, we can go right back to Senator Hoar where he in 1890, he raised this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.270" offset="1660426">He said to Senator Sherman, he inquired and he said -- he asked Sherman if the purpose was to give private citizens a civil remedy in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.655" offset="1705984">Senator Sherman replied, certainly, the second section gives a private remedy to every person injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.829" offset="1742660">Now, this Court in U.S. v. Cooper Corporation cited and relied on that and said in U.S. v. Cooper, private purchaser is given a remedy under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.810" offset="1794591">In footnote 10 of the Brunswick Corporation versus Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, this Court again is considered what legislative history there is and concluded, it is a remedy, a specially for consumers and it is opening the door of justice to every man.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.219" offset="1880273">And that's why we're here this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.834" offset="1890722">The result of the Eighth Circuit is this as I see it, and that's why I ask this Court in -- to reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.128" offset="1923845">Defendants defined property, they say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.476" offset="1933249">This Court should now hold the property is this they say, “a commercial pursuit or interest unconnected with one's business or primary livelihood.”</text>
            <text syncTime="468.512" offset="1977448">Well, we've heard Judge Wyzanski say what this Court had said over the years that the Sherman Act is of constitutional proportions.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.580" offset="2009736">This type of definition belongs in the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.543" offset="2029589">As we all know from that code, this is the type of thing you get there where we would fight over.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.393" offset="2048920">Is it connected?</text>
            <text syncTime="487.155" offset="2051950">Is it unconnected with one's business?</text>
            <text syncTime="489.446" offset="2061145">What is the primary livelihood?</text>
            <text syncTime="490.945" offset="2067101">Their definition would turn the antitrust as a private antitrust practitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.872" offset="2086849">It would turn it into a three-ring circus, and I used to be a tax lawyer many years ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="907.196" offset="3732146">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.253" offset="3744371">In deciding as it did that the consumer has insufficient standing, that it has not been injured in its property.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.065" offset="3779584">The Eighth Circuit at least as to the retail trades in this country, created an antitrust exemption, except for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.906" offset="3822947">$1.3 trillion of commerce, nearly 50% of the gross national product of this country would be removed from the effects of private treble-damage actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.470" offset="3881253">And that fact remains in spite of the thrust of the legislative history, in spite of a clear meaning of the language in my view, in spite of the language used by this Court in many recently decided cases, and in spite of the obvious policy purposes of the treble-damage remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.646" offset="3969964">For commerce at the retail level, the Court of Appeals simply deprives antitrust enforcement altogether of the benefit and assistance of private policing and the private attorneys general.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.565" offset="4025657">And in so doing, the Court of Appeals I think does violence to the twin policy purposes that this Court has ascribed to private antitrust enforcement, compensation and deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.467" offset="4077275">Compensation, because the only victims of the antitrust violation at the retail level are unable to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.217" offset="4116250">Deterrence, because the violations and the violators of the antitrust laws simply do not have to be concerned about the threat of private suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.100" offset="4159822">Indeed, it could be argued that antitrust violations would be encouraged by this ruling if it were made -- if it were generalized because a violator rather than having to anticipate that he would be deprived of the fruits of the illegality, in fact could count on garnering storing up retentions of the fruits of antitrust violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.098" offset="4259715">Now, analysis begins with the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.343" offset="4276746">Injury alone Mr. Justice Rehnquist would not be enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.334" offset="4292733">That is the standard under Section 16 of the Clayton Act for anticipatory injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.748" offset="4322408">But the legislative history makes clear I believe that in formulating a remedy and requiring a proof of standing in order to achieve right of damages, there had to have been some kind of injury to business or property, that is injury to a commercial interest, not in business (Voice Overlap).</text>

            <text syncTime="1104.196" offset="4520208">Mr. Justice Stevens, you can injure business in my view without injuring property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.592" offset="4545703">You can injure business by denying business opportunity, an exclusive dealing arrangement for instance in violation of the antitrust laws might not injure a plaintiff in his property, but could conceivably injure his business by denial of business opportunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1733.574" offset="7037680">The states are interested in this case because of the state's increasing role in antitrust law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.207" offset="7068191">The language of Section 4, the legislative history, and the overwhelming way to the case law supports non-business consumers standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.892" offset="7102986">But even more importantly, the existence of non-business consumers standing is important in the overall scheme of antitrust law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.490" offset="7137364">Threat of treble-damages is a strong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.962" offset="7147186">Indeed, the strongest threat against antitrust violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.571" offset="7169651">Denial of standing the private purchasers would certainly reduce the number of treble-damage actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.170" offset="7196087">This would defeat the two major purposes of Section 4 to deter violators and deprived them of the right of real --- to keep their illegal profits and two, to compensate victims for their injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.504" offset="7249377">This would of course the states recognized the importance of non-business consumer standings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.497" offset="7285321">Criminal prosecutions and government civil actions certainly are not sufficient deterrent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.800" offset="7310608">Public agencies do not have the ability to bring every possible action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.914" offset="7330983">The Justice Department can only bring about 60 to a 100 cases a year, and states are severely and similarly restricted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1817.228" offset="7372257">The lower court exhibited a strong disliked towards private consumer actions saying that they were either coercive by nature or many time non-meritorious.</text>

            <text syncTime="1832.194" offset="7432129">Affirmance of the Eighth Circuit opinion would eliminate all nine business consumer actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.440" offset="7465148">Certainly, there are many cases when private parties can bring a lawsuit on their own and there are certainly many cases when the class would be small enough to be manageable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.360" offset="7504854">For example, a conspiracy to fix real estate prices on residential homes and a particular area could give a small group of individuals enough economic incentive to bring an action on their own, or an individual who purchase a large quantity of goods over a -- or a large quantity of a single item over long period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.203" offset="7596178">For example, a life maintenance drug might have the incentive to bring an action on his own individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.430" offset="7625122">The remedy for a non-manageable class is a refusal to certify the classes and a remedy and the remedy for a non-meritorious action is either dismissal or summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.273" offset="7676426">Next, we would like to discuss the parens issue that was raised here a few minutes ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.393" offset="7700982">Ideally, the parens patriae authority should not be an issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.086" offset="7719685">However, we would hope that this Court would not rely on the parens issue as to the Eighth Circuit to deny private rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.919" offset="7751032">The parens issue was not meant to be a substitute for all private actions, it was meant to be a supplement and not a replacement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1982.348" offset="8032737">But the reason that we feel that this -- that private actions are important is because first of all, the states don't have the resources and the ability to bring all the possible meritorious actions that may exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.649" offset="8085922">And secondly, it could make the whole situation become very political if the Attorney General had to bring every conceivable action in the state, he might then be forced to bring some actions you wouldn't normally bring because he felt that without merit, and it bring a merely to make sure that he wasn't criticize at some future date for not bringing the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.035" offset="8179545">And so the other provision that -- excuse me, that Congress granted was the opt out provision in the Bill itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.506" offset="8209429">Congress said that individuals who didn't feel they wanted to participate in the action of the Attorney General and wanted to retain their own private right to sue could opt out of any specific action that their Attorney General might bring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.863" offset="8262823">And Congress also provided for an opt out provision by the entire state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.782" offset="8282467">Upon action of the legislature, the Attorney General can be prohibited from bringing any action whatsoever, and you could find the very serious and difficult position that a consumer in one state would have a remedy because his legislature did not opt out, and a situation in other state where his state did have an opt -- did opt out and he have no recourse under the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.949" offset="8379120">And so, it's clear I think in the legislative history that Congress was did not intend the attorneys generals to be the exclusive parties in this matters, and that private rights were intended to remain because of the two opt out provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.521" offset="8453413">And as I said earlier, it's -- the attorneys general don't have the resources to bring all the potential actions in their state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.384" offset="8484864">Finally, this Court has expressed concern with the complexity of the treble-damage actions and stated recently that the already protracted treble-damage proceedings should be kept as simple as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.532" offset="8541497">The states would like to suggest that this would -- affirmance of the Eighth Circuit would merely make it more complex situation because in entirely new line of thinking would have to be device new body allotted to determine whether or not it was a business or a personal purchase, and whether or not the business purchase was used as intended for genuinely business purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.841" offset="8650689">So, we would like to -- we would respectfully hope that this court would reverse the Eighth Circuit, that the affirmance of the Eighth Circuit would frustrate the underlying principles of the antitrust laws, that would permit a price fixer to keep his ill-gotten gains and deprive the victim of his most effective remedy and have no means to be compensated, and it would eliminate a major deterrent to treble-damage actions, and so we would urge this Court to reverse the Eighth Circuit and reaffirm the existence of non-business consumer standing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2249.378" offset="9100936">However, I think that Congress has already acted and through the reading of the language of the legislative history of the Sherman Act as we've talked about here earlier, and also the discussions that were back in 1973, 1974, and 1975 when the antitrust to prove an action to pass it, Congress already assumed that the consumer had -- the consumer had this right, and consequently, they felt that there was a necessary to make it any more clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.048" offset="9227577">And I think that the courts if I may say, the Eighth Circuit has gone beyond what the Congress intended and they are the once who have acted in the policy and the legislative way rather than this Court doing the same thing if they reverse the Eighth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2419.043" offset="9779493">It purports to be a class action but as yet, there has been no certification of the class.</text>

            <text syncTime="2630.469" offset="10625233">Judge Larson in the Reiter decision at the outside -- at the outset of this case denying the motion to dismiss for lack of standing very amply pointed out at page 937 of his opinion that nobody knows what the word consumers meant when the Sherman Act was on the consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.416" offset="10737037">Nobody knows what Congress was thinking about at the time with regard to retail consumers except if you read the history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.766" offset="10782386">You find that there was great concern in the Congress, that they would be interfering with state's rights and state's jurisdiction if they dealt with the kind of retail consumer that we have today in our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.285" offset="10856469">In the context of the society at the time, we had come to the end of the first 100 years of the republic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.615" offset="10889801">There had been a depression in the 70's, there had been a depression in the 80's, and there had come along in our economic society, this then new thing which we called trusts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.387" offset="10944972">There were corporations and corporations where to some degree regulated by the states, but there where these trusts which were completely unregulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.885" offset="10982902">And there was this squabble going on between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party at the time over protective terrors, and people were clamoring for some halter on the trusts as they were called at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.443" offset="11049148">President Grover Cleveland made a speech to the Congress in his third message on the state of the union that something had to be done about the trusts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.232" offset="11092302">And in 1888, Senator Sherman in the 50th Congress introduced resolutions to the effect that something had to be done about the trusts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.629" offset="11145906">We finally get to the 53rd Congress where we had his bill, Senate Bill 1, which was the forerunner of the Sherman Antitrust Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.497" offset="11189373">And if you read this legislative history carefully, the bill was finally sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee and it came out in a relatively few days with nothing left except its title, S1 and Senator Sherman's name absolutely obliterated everything he had in his bills except his name and the title.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.061" offset="11291564">The Bill came out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and for the first time, we had this phrase that we're worrying with here today called business or property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.397" offset="11336913">What does it mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.878" offset="11346840">The various members of the Senate Judiciary Committee talked about the small businessman, the small mechanic who is in business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.020" offset="11387486">He talked about small farmers, and you can find in there references to problems such as the one I remember most specifically, if a small tobacco farmer had to go to the “trust” to buy baling cotton to bale his tobacco and he was overcharged, this was the kind of commercial enterprise we were talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.466" offset="11485288">Nowhere do we find any definition of property such as we try to find in the dictionary, the Webster's International on the bridged, Black's Law Dictionary, I went back to Bouvier's Law Dictionary of my law school days of many years ago, nothing that will give us a guideline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.831" offset="11570657">All that you can sense out of this total legislative history on the Sherman Act was they were talking about business or property in the total commercial sense of property involved in business.</text>

            <text syncTime="3062.104" offset="12351822">They simply reiterated what was Section 7 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.893" offset="12374915">Now, I've heard some talks here today about parens patriae and about direct purchasers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3098.607" offset="12497795">With regard to parens patriae, I went through the legislative history of the 1976 statute very carefully because in the Government's brief, they say it's a procedural device.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.520" offset="12577416">They point to Footnote 14 in the Illinois Brick case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.472" offset="12609285">In the state's brief, we find that the states are saying it created a new cause of action, a substantive right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.975" offset="12647320">And if by chance you have to interpret the 1976 parens patriae provisions, they would prefer to have it treated as a substantive provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.129" offset="12691937">Well, the legislative history of the 1976 Act is quite something to read.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.260" offset="12728404">A bill -- there were three bills in the House, there was one bill in the Senate, the bills went back and forth, There came a time when they were worried about losing the Bill because of a filibuster by Senator Allen of Alabama at the end of that particular session.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.099" offset="12787754">There was never a conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.068" offset="12795695">There was a legislative name such as I have never read in my lifetime where a motion was made by Senator Byrd, then the majority whipped.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.246" offset="12836342">Senator Philip Hart handled it, and the upshot was two sections which were not concerned with here, the first two sections of that Act where the House's version.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.634" offset="12881899">The third section which is parens patriae was the version of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.071" offset="12899662">It was the Senate's Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.003" offset="12907395">And if you read what the sponsor of the bill said, Senator Hart and his analysis of the bill as they it, he says very specifically, we created a new cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.387" offset="12964968">In that respect with due deference to the court, Footnote 14 in the Illinois Brick case which says it's a procedural device and which says only the House Report on the Bill is just plain incorrect because Senator Hart's remarks has sponsored the Bill of the intention, the intention to create “a new cause of action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.152" offset="13071966">And the Senate Report, are to the contrary, and I would say they governed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.333" offset="13096730">And so, you have a new cause of action and I do not believe that an adverse rulings such as that of the Eighth Circuit will obviate the parens patriae provision or take the heart out of it.</text>
