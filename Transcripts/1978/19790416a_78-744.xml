            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="61.070" offset="347617">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.480" offset="361305">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.038" offset="383561">The issue is whether a defendant is entitled to collateral relief from his conviction under 28 U.S.C. 2255 merely because the district judge failed to follow the formal requirements of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in accepting his guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.315" offset="456600">We believe that under this Court's consistent interpretation of the scope of habeas corpus for non-constitutional errors, respondent was not entitled to Section 2255 relief as a result of this violation of the rule and that the Court of Appeals therefore erred in reversing the District Court's order denying the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.400" offset="532982">The facts may be briefly summarized as follows.Respondent was one of 22 defendants named in a narcotics conspiracy indictment filed in the Eastern District of Michigan in May 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.181" offset="588048">After extensive plea bargaining, respondent agreed to plead guilty to the conspiracy count of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.777" offset="618454">In return, the Government agreed to drop the remaining 17 substantive counts and also agreed not to pursue an unrelated bail jumping charge against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.155" offset="660041">The District Court then conducted a Rule 11 proceeding at which it questioned respondent prior to determining whether to accept his plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.565" offset="693582">There's no dispute that the Court's inquiry at this proceeding fully complied with Rule 11 in every respect except one.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.978" offset="727333">Although the court mentioned that if respondent pleaded guilty he could be sentenced to 15 years imprisonment and a 5 -- and $25,000 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.623" offset="761814">The court neglected to add that responded could all -- would also be subject to a mandatory special parole term of at least three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.576" offset="793684">Four months later, respondent was sentenced to 10 years in prison, 5 years special parole, and to a $5,000 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.863" offset="830777">Now, respondent did not appeal his conviction nor during the following two years did he signal his displeasure with any other aspect of his plea in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.277" offset="872469">In August 1976 however, respondent moved to vacate his sentence under Section 2255, alleging for the first time that the District Court had violated Rule 11 in it -- by failing to mention the special parole term at the time of his plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.097" offset="939760">Motion is set out at page 11 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.536" offset="961494">It alleges only that Rule 11 was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.878" offset="978840">It doesn't expressly state that respondent was actually unaware of the special parole provisions when he pleaded guilty and more important, it doesn't claim that respondent wouldn't have entered the exact same guilty plea if the judge had notified him on the record of the special parole requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.099" offset="1051773">In fact, the motion doesn't allege that respondent was prejudiced in any way by a violation of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.740" offset="1078314">And the same can be said for respondent's allegations in his memorandum in support of his motion which is set out beginning at page 14 of the appendix and the oral argument that the hearing on that motion which begins at page 18 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.190" offset="1144142">No allegation of actual prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.455" offset="1157204">Now, the District Court denied respondent's 2255 motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.773" offset="1170474">The court acknowledged that it hadn't complied fully with Rule 11 in taking respondent's plea but it concluded that respondent had -- respondent hadn't been harmed in any way by the technical error and that he therefore was entitled to Section 2255 relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.489" offset="1233377">The court noted that there were strong indications in the record that respondent had been informed by his attorney of the consequences of his plea prior to pleading guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.160" offset="1276008">But that even if he hadn't in light of all the factors involved in the plea bargain, knowledge of the special parole provisions wouldn't have influenced respondent's decision to plea guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.462" offset="1317177">The Sixth Circuit reversed and remanded with instructions to vacate respondent's conviction and to allow him to plead anew.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.604" offset="1345808">The Court of Appeals didn't dispute any of the District Court's fact findings but it held relying primarily on this Court's decision in McCarthy against the United States that since Rule 11 had been violated, respondent was automatically entitled to withdraw his plea without regard to whether he was actually prejudiced by the defect or whether he had raised the Rule 11 violation on direct appeal or on collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.285" offset="1448521">Now, I think it would be helpful for me to begin my discussion by explaining the limits of the Government's submission in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.926" offset="1479032">We certainly don't contend that a defendant who pleads guilty is there ever foreclosed from ever attacking his guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.242" offset="1508289">Defendant has a number of adequate remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.960" offset="1519261">He can move to withdraw his plea before sentencing and under Rule 32 (d), withdrawal for virtually any reason is to be freely allowed at that stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.368" offset="1556877">And after sentence has been imposed, the defendant may appeal his conviction and may of course raise any objections he may have to the plea taking procedure or to the plea itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.122" offset="1599822">And even after the time for appeal has run and the conviction has become final, a defendant unquestionably may always attack his conviction collaterally under Section 2255 if the plea was involuntary or otherwise constitutionally defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.206" offset="1668159">Our contention here is simply that a defendant who foregoes all of these remedies is not entitled to collateral relief from his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.333" offset="1700655">Often as in this case, years after his guilty plea when all that he can show is that some portion of Rule 11 was not complied with when his plea was accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.089" offset="1739734">We believe that on collateral attack there must also be some showing of substantial prejudice to the defendant either in the sense that the Rule 11 error materially affected the defendant's decision to plead guilty or because for any other reason it would be manifestly unjust to hold him to his plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.978" offset="1811310">This standard of collateral review of non-constitutional errors is one that this Court has frequently applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.189" offset="1840149">And perhaps the case closest in point is Hill against the United States in 368 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.482" offset="1865331">That case like this one involved a motion to vacate sentence under Section 2255 by a defendant who claimed that his conviction had been entered in violation of a rule of criminal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.762" offset="1914441">The rule involved there was Rule 32 (a) which gives a defendant an absolute right to make a statement prior to sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.204" offset="1948191">Although the court acknowledged in Hill that the right guaranteed to defendant by Rule 32 (a) was an important one and that the defect would've required vacation of the defendant's sentence if it had been raised on direct appeal, the court denied collateral relief, saying that the error was not a fundamental defect that inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="485.580" offset="2045680">Mr. Geller, was there anything said in Hill about prejudice?</text>
            <text syncTime="490.289" offset="2064488">I had read Hill to simply mean this is not the kind of thing for which you can have collateral relief, period.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="496.798" offset="2090611">Well, the court could have decided Hill, I think, on the ground that, not having appealed, Hill was foreclosed from getting collateral relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.119" offset="2123839">But it went on.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.776" offset="2126451">It didn't go off on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.070" offset="2131675">It went on to discuss what the requirements are for getting collateral relief for a non-constitutional plea and it set forth the standard that we rely on here which is that there must be a fundamental defect that inherently results in a substantial miscarriage of justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="522.414" offset="2193011">But it -- is it because the nature of the fundamental defect is such that the defect will inevitably in every case result in a denial of justice or is it a question of prejudice case by case?</text>

            <text syncTime="543.084" offset="2275662">Well, Hill says that on the -- for a Rule 32 error, the only remedy is a direct appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="556.394" offset="2328952">Well, except, I suppose, in the situation of a change in law such as in the Davis situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.019" offset="2351417">That made that to limited exception but otherwise I would agree with Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.103" offset="2371793">The court added in Hill that collateral relief as I said, is not available in that type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.644" offset="2397915">And the same statements that the court made in Hill were repeated even more recently in the Davis case in 417 U.S. and again in Stone against Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.223" offset="2440234">In light of these decisions, we think it's rather clear that respondent's claim which as the District Court noted amounts to nothing more than the assertion that Rule 11 was violated when he pleaded guilty is not cognizable under Section 2255.</text>

            <text syncTime="1128.881" offset="4618846">So, like the District Court in light of these factors, we think it's exceedingly improbable that that respondent would've changed his mind about the plea bargain if he had been informed that he could also be sentenced to a term of special parole which would not have any appreciable effects upon him unless he were years later to violate the conditions of the parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.364" offset="4696795">Moreover, there's no manifest in justice in holding respondent to this guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.863" offset="4718843">As I just mentioned, respondent knew he -- when he pleaded guilty that he could be sentenced up to 15 years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.053" offset="4747577">And his eventual sentence of 10 years imprisonment plus 5 years special parole is therefore no greater for practical purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.452" offset="4777148">It's substantially less than he was told he could receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.183" offset="4792090">Even if respondent violates the conditions of the special parole and the parole commission determines to send him back to prison for that 5-year period he can't serve more than the 15 years in prison that he knew was his exposure when he pleaded guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.338" offset="4852694">Now, perhaps the most important reason in our view why respondent isn't entitled to Section 2255 relief as a result of this non-constitutional violation is that this is hardly a situation where as the court said in Hill, the need for the remedy afforded by the writ of habeas corpus is apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.896" offset="4926986">There's no reason why this Rule 11 defect couldn't have been raised on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.639" offset="4945899">All the relevant facts relating to the violation are apparent on the face of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.220" offset="4964289">And respondent who had the advice of counsel should've been aware at the time of sentencing that the trial judge had neglected to mention the special parole term when the plea was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.742" offset="5006294">This is especially true I would think when a -- if a defendant's ignorance of the special parole term truly played a meaningful role in his decision to enter the guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.093" offset="5043702">There's no reason why a defendant such as respondent should be allowed to forego direct appeal and to wait several years to raise a claim such as this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1387.506" offset="5653400">Nonetheless, the court felt that respondent was entitled to relief because of the presumptive prejudice rule of McCarthy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1536.902" offset="6250977">Now, this Court is well aware of the strong societal interest in the finality of judgments in criminal cases and while society may be willing to incur the substantial costs associated with collateral attacks in order to correct or -- errors of constitutional magnitude or cases where a prisoner has been grievously harmed and the writ is the only effective means of preserving his rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2686.253" offset="10848423">I think the keyword to somewhat who is being sentenced his parole and the fact that this is a different kind of parole that applies only in drug cases and only since 1970 and does not apply in other circumstances in the federal system might easily escape the person who's being sentenced in terms of the significance and in terms of the differences between the mandatory special parole and traditional parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.373" offset="10948838">Section 2255 exists to ensure the capacity of our legal system to provide substantive justice and to ensure a forum for releasing all cases of illegal restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.394" offset="10996903">It is a flexible remedy and as this Court indicated in language in its opinion in Davis there is nothing in the holdings of -- in the prior holdings of this Court to indicate that the availability of 2255 is in any way reduced where the allegation of illegal custody is one grounded in laws as opposed to the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.049" offset="11091571">I think that's an -- by way of background, that undercuts the Government's argument with respect to the non-constitutional nature of the argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.590" offset="11133680">Additionally, I think that it is important for the court to consider the role of Rule 11 in protecting the adversary system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.824" offset="11162624">That in contrast to a trial situation and a collateral attack after a trial, such as occurred in Davis, where there is adversary litigation as to numerous questions of law and where there is a full fact finding process, the likelihood of any one error being prejudicial or being fundamentally prejudicial is reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.326" offset="11244648">In a guilty plea proceeding however, where the charges are not disputed and where a person is convicting himself or herself out of his or her own mouth, an indi -- an error that fails to advice the defendant of an important consequence of the guilty plea assumes much more fundamental dimensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.520" offset="11349452">When the additional fact that approximately 85% of the convictions in the federal system are the result of guilty pleas is taken into account, I think that the significance to the importance -- to maintaining the principles underlying the adversary system is enhanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.256" offset="11416430">And it's for that -- taking those matters into account, I think that the Government's argument with regard to restricting the scope of collateral review has to be unpersuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.783" offset="11458539">I think that the Government's argument with regard to direct appeal being a sufficient remedy is further undercut by the fact that the Rule 32 (a) (2) does not require an accused to be advised of the right to appeal and in point of fact, Mr. Timmreck here was not advised of his right to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.417" offset="11517053">And it is also important to note that the mandatory special parole term is a unique provision which operates very differently from traditional parole and can result in incarceration for the entire period of the mandatory special parole term even if the violation occurs on the last day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.221" offset="11584240">Also, that the risk of re-incarceration is not minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.400" offset="11600959">The statistics would indicate that between 35% and 45% of persons placed on parole are subsequently returned to prison for violations and that approximately 2/3 of those violations are technical and rather than being for commission of additional felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.141" offset="11671907">The Government's argument in this case that particular prejudice ought to be shown is similar to its argument in McCarthy that substantial compliance with Rule 11 was sufficient for purposes of direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.583" offset="11729690">The rejection of that argument in McCarthy, I think, applies with equal force here because as this Court noted in McCarthy, a violation of Rule 11 inherently prejudices the accused because it deprives him or her of the rule's procedural safeguards that are designed to facilitate the ac -- an accurate determination of the voluntariness of the plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.284" offset="11816521">Similarly, the Government's argument that particular prejudice ought to be shown, I think would create a standard which is more difficult to administer than the objective standard applied by the Sixth Circuit here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.818" offset="11870647">It would involve the District Courts in hearings on the question of particular prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.038" offset="11891545">It would involve the courts in -- it would be more time consuming in terms of judicial time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.598" offset="11913801">It would be more difficult to achieve uniform results and it would make it difficult to any defendant regardless of whether the defendant would in fact have continued with the guilty plea to meet the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.295" offset="11972524">I think it would be con -- I would hope that the Government would concede that persons plead guilty for numbers of -- any number of reasons, some of which are beyond the comprehension of experienced counsel and judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.511" offset="12025396">And that in these -- some circumstances, persons would not have continued to offer their pleas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.677" offset="12046085">The standard that the Government proposes is one which would make it difficult for all persons including them to sustain their burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.641" offset="12081925">An objective test would promote judicial economy by results being determined on the basis of the pleadings and it would provide an additional incentive not only to defense counsel and to government counsel on the basis of their general ethical responsibility, but by an additional incentive because of the standard --</text>

            <text syncTime="3514.121" offset="14159809">And you have to measure voluntariness by what he knew at the time he pleaded guilty or what he would've done at the time he pleaded guilty if he had been told what he now claims he should've been told.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.078" offset="14195649">And subsequent events are only relevant, I think, in determining whether it's fair to hold him to his plea which is a separate sort of an inquiry although an equal ground for allowing collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.423" offset="14237027">The final thing I want to say is that Mr. Mogill made the statement a moment ago, I think in an attempt to show prejudice for the first time since this motion never alleged prejudice that his client could be in prison for longer than he was told or at least subject to supervision for longer than he was told.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.178" offset="14304110">He can't serve more than 15 years because he got a 10-year prison sentence and a 5-year special parole term.</text>
