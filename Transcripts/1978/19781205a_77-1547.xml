            <text syncTime="1180.752" offset="4826363">It has been a gradual change in the government’s position with respect to the secrecy of grand jury proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.614" offset="4849873">It almost coincided with the semi-national scandal involving Dita Beard and ITT.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.984" offset="4887280">It was augmented by the Watergate situation and the fear of government prosecutors that the world would think that they had been guilty of a cover-up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.183" offset="4924061">In fact in this case, the accusation basically of a cover-up was made by the former antitrust division attorney who had left the office six months before the indictment came down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.854" offset="4978813">These are the Jonathan P Nave affidavits, which were attached as exhibits to the motion to supplement the appeal in the Ninth Circuit supplement the record by respondents and which per the Ninth Circuit opinion, it considered in making its ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.185" offset="5052061">There are pages 26 through 42 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.858" offset="5070764">The former person in the government Mr. Nave stated that his attention had been drawn to the portion of the competitive impact statement filed in the civil case which said "since the government did not develop evidence price fixing with respect to gasoline, other than rebrand gasoline basically" this is the only the reason the rebrand gasoline alone was involved in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.587" offset="5193749">Mr. Nave filed an affidavit in camera together with his statement about that portion of the competitive impact statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.440" offset="5229171">At the direction of the Judge Pregerson, he then filed the second affidavit which is contained in the appendix at approximately the page number I mentioned, approximately page 30, in which he while not referring to specific companies, gave five lines of inquiry that he knew from having conducted the portion of the grand jury until September of 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.520" offset="5341497">He gave the leads which the government had but as to which no indictment had come down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.427" offset="5377128">Retail price fixing, no indictment came down, no one was accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.227" offset="5400325">This retail price fixing under his affidavit included an alleged pipeline right into the executive office of the White House.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.526" offset="5433448">Second, use of exchange agreements to deny supplied independence, no indictment was ever handed down for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.576" offset="5461661">Third, collusive action they would like to deny import" no indictment as to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.186" offset="5484126">Fourth, collusion to eliminate cross hauling and fifth collusion to include the price of credit cards in the sale of crude oil so that independents, who did not have their own crude oil supply could not compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.659" offset="5542013">This charge was basically a charge to cover-up by a former man in the division.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.983" offset="5575346">I think it has made the government understandably very sensible about taking any kind of position against disclosure of any transcript involved in these grand juries but may I say to this Court the very act of a former attorney for the antitrust division in filing in this kind of affidavit is I believe a violation of Rule 6(e).</text>

            <text syncTime="2343.379" offset="9476890">Although the United States does not oppose disclosure in this case, it has a vital interest as prosecutor in preserving the traditional secrecy of grand jury proceedings and we do not believe our position in this case is in anyway inconsistent with that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.682" offset="9538121">As the briefs of the parties made clear, the federal rules of criminal procedure do not revamp the questions presented here, they do not designate which court should rule whether disclosure should be permitted nor do they specify what showing is required in order to warn disclosure in particular proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.945" offset="9611160">The government submits that the ultimate authority to disclose grand jury materials must trust in each case in the District Court in which the grand jury was convened and further that the grand jury court in this case properly permitted disclosure based upon a finding that there was a particularized need that outweighed the considerations in favor of continued secrecy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.738" offset="9706350">It is petitioner’s contention that the Arizona civil court rather than the grand jury court was in the best position to make a certiorari and examination of particularized need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.186" offset="9748146">And they urge that because the Arizona court and they urge that the Arizona court had jurisdiction to order disclosure because petitioners who were parties, over whom that court had jurisdiction had in their possession copies of the grand jury transcripts of the testimony given by their employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.080" offset="9815646">In our brief, we discuss what we believe to be the general reasons why the grand jury court and not the civil court should ultimately rule on a propriety of disclosure in each case, but we think then in this case, the court need not reach these more general considerations because the facts here make it clear that it would be inappropriate for the Arizona civil court to authorize disclosure by directing the petitioners here to reveal to respondents the copies of the grand jury transcripts that petitioners had in their possession.</text>

            <text syncTime="2906.321" offset="11728645">Well, I think that is quite right, in particular cases that will vary how much familiarity the individual judge has but one of the concerns that we have is how easy will it be for the court to determine what the most important considerations in favor of secrecy or continued secrecy are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.209" offset="11800221">If it’s the court in which the criminal proceedings have been conducted where the grand jury have, the entire record will be available there, not just bits and pieces, not just the transcripts which these petitioners happened to have disclosed to them, which may not give the whole picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.038" offset="11863542">The local prosecutors who have conducted the grand jury who will know where their further proceedings are contemplated, who will know if particular witnesses were extremely reluctant and feared that their statements might be unnecessarily made available to certain parties, all that information is most readily available in the court where the grand jury proceedings were conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.366" offset="11952880">And we believe that in many cases and this case is a very good example of the ability of the grand jury court to determine has the person requesting disclosure comes forward with a sufficient showing of particularized need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.408" offset="12012962">It is not a case we think where it is the court’s duty to go through all of the records and determine whether there might be some conceivable way in which the documents can be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.269" offset="12052459">The person seeking disclosure, the respondents here, came for we believe with quite a plain showing of particularized need and the government which despite petitioner’s disagreement is indeed concerned with the question whether there is a continued need for secrecy, took into account not only the question whether they had been showing a particularized need, but whether there is a reason for continued secrecy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3401.490" offset="13709354">Historically, the better practice has been for the trial judge to believe that he would need the grand jury materials and to ask the grand jury district judge to forward them to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.813" offset="13778631">In Baker versus United States Steel, pending to the District of Connecticut, Judge Newman came with the conclusion that portions of the grand jury materials might be relevant and he requested Judge White who was the titular custodian of those documents to transmit the grand jury materials to the District of Connecticut so that Judge Newman could review them and see whether there was a particularized need for the disclosure.</text>

            <text syncTime="3468.876" offset="13978833">And the third matter is that there is a particularized need in this litigation to refresh the recollection of a witness who has said he doesn’t remember now but when he has transcript, when he appeared before the grand jury four years ago, his memory was a lot better and he was sure that if he could look at that transcript, it would refresh his recollection.</text>
