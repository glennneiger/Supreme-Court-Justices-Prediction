            <label>Mr. Peter Megargee Brown</label>
            <text syncTime="94.500" offset="481364">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.683" offset="498082">This case, Stafford against Briggs, in tandem with Colby v. Driver, the next case to be heard, was argued here last April 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.171" offset="548028">And on May 4, this Court placed it on the calendar for reargument now.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.051" offset="579584">Very briefly, this is a case on writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.034" offset="611558">Colby is on writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.335" offset="640711">In both cases, the same precise issue is presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.123" offset="671848">Did Congress intend, in enacting the Mandamus and Venue Act of 1962 to grant to the District Courts national -- nationwide personal jurisdiction over federal officials sued for money damages in their pocketbooks for acts allegedly performed under color of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.303" offset="788564">In other words, did Congress intend back in 1962 that federal officials can be sued not only, in essence, against the United States, administrative actions, judicial review of those involving the interests of the United States, but also, as respondents claimed, in essence against their own pocketbooks, in any court of the country, regardless of where the harried official works or lives a burden never before imposed on the citizenry?</text>
            <text syncTime="215.931" offset="967137">Did Congress intend this discrimination against federal employees?</text>
            <text syncTime="220.960" offset="987199">Now, Stafford against Briggs is a Bivens type action, civil rights tort alleging unconstitutional acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.388" offset="1024920">All of the alleged acts took place in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.114" offset="1047803">Plaintiffs chose to bring their suit in the District of Columbia, seeking $1.5 million from the private assets of four individuals who were, or are, federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.463" offset="1105272">Plaintiffs' counsel acknowledged that this case was brought in the District of Columbia after shopping for the most favorable forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.136" offset="1135888">Similarly, Mr. Wulf, in his oral argument on April 24, conceded that Rhode Island was selected because, “We did not think it was an inhospitable forum, as a matter of fact.”</text>
            <text syncTime="274.262" offset="1200462">Who are the defendants in Stafford against Briggs?</text>
            <text syncTime="278.827" offset="1218644">It would be helpful to put this in perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.907" offset="1230973">First is petitioner William Stafford, then United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida, now a United States District Judge in the Northern District of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.616" offset="1285831">Petitioner Carrouth, Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Northern District of Florida, now in private practice in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.440" offset="1313102">Petitioner Meadow, a special agent of the FBI stationed in Florida, still working in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.916" offset="1342986">So all of the petitioners have roots in Florida, they're not floating public officials.</text>

            <text syncTime="471.841" offset="1990719">Plaintiffs are -- were anti-war demonstrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.746" offset="2002317">They were called before a grand jury in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.559" offset="2017573">None of these plaintiffs in Stafford below reside in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.919" offset="2051009">They were indicted for conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.754" offset="2058428">Their case became known as the Gainesville Eight, and each was acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.454" offset="2081207">Their complaint is that Goodwin somehow did a little dissembling before they went to the grand jury, even though they were acquitted, and that this violated their constitutional rights, and that therefore -- therefore Stafford and Carrouth and Meadow, who didn't say anything have to come to the District of Columbia under this Mandamus and Venue Act misuse and defend themselves for months and months and months, even though they're resident in Florida, and even though they could not under normal and regular procedures applicable to all citizens be sued in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.415" offset="2280991">And I think it's significant that we're not here saying public officials cannot be sued for wrongful acts under color of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.595" offset="2321742">We say that -- that they can be and in this particular case, the place to sue them is in Florida, and that's where the respondents concede.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.681" offset="2374092">They could have sued all of them in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.163" offset="2384018">So it's not a problem of multiplicity of suits, et cetera, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.806" offset="2398647">They can sue them in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.345" offset="2408782">Now, the District of Columbia Circuit determined that notwithstanding that the second section of the Mandamus and Venue Act does give personal jurisdiction over these Florida residents and this is the question before this Court at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.953" offset="2539186">My argument is -- is a simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.882" offset="2554859">It's -- it's one point common to petitioners in this case and in the tandem Colby case.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.637" offset="2577951">And that is that the statute involved here simply does not apply to respondent suits against federal officials' pocketbooks.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.636" offset="2621942">It wasn't intended to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.764" offset="2634480">There is nothing in the purpose, the history, of the statute to show that that was so.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.569" offset="2669693">Specifically, that section was not intended by Congress to supply jurisdiction and venue in tort suits and certainly not in -- in Bivens type actions which in 1962 were not heard of, and it was nine years later -- it was on June 21, 1971 that Mr. Justice Brennan's decision came down in Bivens, and it was -- it was a new law and new application.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.721" offset="2810232">So that the basic reasons that -- that I believe that the First Circuit and the D.C. Circuit have made a mistake, and that the Second Circuit is correct is, (a) the purpose of the statute is a single-theme purpose, and it doesn't include suing people for a million and a half in their pocketbooks, public officials, or a billion dollars in Rhode Island where none of them have ever been -- against their pocketbooks in Rhode Island in Colby.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.464" offset="2945233">And the history of the statute makes clear that it wasn't intended to -- to apply to pocketbook suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.330" offset="2984730">And we also take the position that the language of the statute, that is the Mandamus and Venue Act of 1962, the statute at large, that read as a whole, as it must be, shows that this is a -- in the nature of mandamus suit, it involves in essence against the United States and it -- it doesn't involve Bivens type tort actions, pocketbook suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.724" offset="3106252">So that, when the statute is read in its full context, with realization of its purpose, and in the light of its legislative history, it becomes clear that Congress did not direct or intend a coverage of the Bivens type actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.418" offset="3177096">Now, in Blackburn, I would like to point out one thing about Blackburn internally.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.640" offset="3221922">Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question about Mr. Goodwin.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.082" offset="3239685">Mr. Goodwin resides in Washington, D.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.743" offset="3258389">He's sued by -- by the civil rights bar in -- in the Southern District of New York in -- in Blackburn.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.973" offset="3299244">He's also sued in another case there called Cole, and they treated them together.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.752" offset="3318366">But he's sued twice, hit twice, like a shuttlecock, in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.234" offset="3336338">Now, the District Court made a holding, which was not appealed, that there wasn't the slightest evidence connecting Goodwin to a conspiracy as alleged in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.930" offset="3395062">No evidence, no threshold evidence therefore, the long arm statute, he held, goes out.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.751" offset="3426408">However, the District Court Judge Haight found that 1391 (e) did give the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.866" offset="3454830">Now there's the abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.366" offset="3460786">Not the slightest evidence under the long arm statute, but ah-hah, 1391 (e), somehow or other, because perhaps of the climate of thinking today, can reach out and bring Goodwin in and make him go through motions to dismiss, discovery motions, and a -- and a harassed life.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.568" offset="3549602">Now, it was -- it was that holding of the District Court on 1391 (e) that the panel reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.717" offset="3578232">We argued in March.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.855" offset="3582830">They came down September 10 with their opinion which is Exhibit A.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.125" offset="3603832">Now, I say that there are several things that show that pocketbook suits are not included by the intention of Congress in 1962.</text>

            <text syncTime="1016.631" offset="4169853">And again there was -- that was a habeas corpus action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.401" offset="4180929">The locale was Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.024" offset="4191483">The -- the young man seeking habeas corpus was in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.857" offset="4222830">The only problem was and it's stated quite clearly by this Court, Mr. Justice Douglas, the sole question in the case is whether the District Court for the district of Arizona had jurisdiction to entertain on the merits petitioner's application for a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.780" offset="4298480">Now -- now, Mr. Justice Douglas said that it was -- unless the -- the custodian, the necessary party in other words, was -- was within the jurisdiction of Arizona.</text>

            <text syncTime="1066.139" offset="4367966">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.080" offset="4371728">The -- the custodian was in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.573" offset="4385625">The -- the superior officers, also alleged necessary parties are in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.697" offset="4414151">And -- and it was argued and Mr. Mel Wulf was a -- a friend of the Court, more a friend of the -- of Mr. Schlanger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.578" offset="4465664">They argued that -- that the -- if the normal jurisdiction would not stretch to cover the custodians on some kind of Strait against Laird notion that if it wouldn't stretch, then -- then use 1391 (e), and that's where the discovery was made that 1391 (e) is a -- is a pretty good idea to grab jurisdiction over -- over public officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.918" offset="4579035">And -- and at that time, Mr. Justice Douglas held that the lack of jurisdiction was fatal, and that the 1391 (e) would not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.007" offset="4655417">Why wouldn't 1391 (e) apply?</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.120" offset="4667852">This Court, with the Chief Justice sitting, Black, Brennan, White, Marshall and Blackmun joined, Harlan, J., concurred in the result, Stewart, J., dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.458" offset="4725217">With that opinion, Mr. Justice Douglas said that 1391 (a) was enacted to broaden the venue of civil actions which could previously have been brought only in the District of Columbia -- only have been brought in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.698" offset="4802121">Now, the -- the Stafford case could not have been brought in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.460" offset="4841200">Tort actions in 1962 and before could have been brought anywhere as they were not restricted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.958" offset="4867218">And that is a limitation on the -- the kind of cases that can be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.056" offset="4903581">And it also shows that -- that 1391 (e), as a venue statute is not -- does not cover all civil actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1211.399" offset="4948929">Well, there's another very good explanation why 1391 (e) wasn't applicable in the Schlanger case and that is that 1391 (e) by its own terms provides this venue, as it says, except as otherwise provided by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.651" offset="5021968">And in the habeas corpus, is limited by law to the venue of the custodial officer, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1271.806" offset="5190614">And -- and it -- it found that it did not and that quotation of footnote 4 doesn't go to -- to exceptions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1301.698" offset="5310151">In fact, that is the recurrent theme going through the preferred sources, the -- the Senate Report and the House Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.130" offset="5371904">I think that -- that if you look at the purpose of this legislation, you will see that it doesn't provide for pocketbook suits, whether they be for $1.5 million or $1 billion or $100,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.949" offset="5467199">Take the House and Senate Reports, both state what the purpose is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.026" offset="5499486">+And I think everybody seems to jump over it but it's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.230" offset="5516309">It says, the purpose of this bill -- bill -- is to make it possible to bring actions against government officials and agencies in U.S. District Courts outside the District of Columbia, which, because of certain existing limitations on jurisdiction and venue may now be brought only in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.167" offset="5664057">Now, I also want to call Your Honors attention in connection with purpose to the House Report that states unequivocally that the purpose of Section 1391 (e), that's the second section, that the purpose of 1391 (e) was, “Similar to that of” Section 1361, which is the first section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.438" offset="5793102">And then the report says -- and I think it's highly significant, and this is at the Colby petition 91A, that the new venue provision was and now I'm quoting, “Designed to permit an action which is essentially against the United States to be brought locally rather than requiring that it be brought in the District of Columbia simply because Washington is the official residence of the officer or agency sued.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.191" offset="5980139">Now, what we have here is respondents and the court below turning the statute upside down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.255" offset="6008351">Instead of using the statute to bring a suit locally, which could formerly have been brought only in Washington, D.C., respondents seek to bring an action in Washington, D.C., which could only have been brought locally.</text>

            <text syncTime="1563.113" offset="6355780">Petitioners rely most heavily on that decision, but in a way, respondents rely upon it also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.666" offset="6390053">We rely upon it as making absolutely clear the importance of considering the entire legislative history, and not merely part of it in determining the scope of Section 1391 (e) for the only way the Second Circuit could have ruled as it did was by ignoring critical parts of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.675" offset="6510111">That is the only way that one can -- one can conclude that Section 1391 (e) does not encompass damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.211" offset="6556191">This Court is aware of the fact that three Deputy Attorney Generals and a Justice Department spokesman addressed the -- expressed themselves on the damage action issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.871" offset="6614810">Three of them told Congress before the law was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.083" offset="6639679">And that Congress interacting with -- and responding to the Department selectively either adopted suggestions from the Department of Justice, changing the wording of one or the other of the statutes before it or rejected the Department's suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.686" offset="6722121">The Justice Department was in repeated contact with Congress, trying to get Congress to exclude damage actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.337" offset="6760678">What the representatives of the Department of Justice said and the Congressional reaction thereto is essential to a meaningful analysis of Congress' intent because their statements to Congress show that Congress was made fully aware of the damage issue while it was considering the proposed bill and that Congress was fully aware that the proposed bill covered damage actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.126" offset="6879901">The Department of Justice tried to get Congress not to include damage actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.231" offset="6904247">It told Congress how to avoid covering damage actions, what language to use to avoid damage actions.At least twice, Congress rejected the Department of Justice warnings about proposed language and employed language that clearly covered damage actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.718" offset="6994213">Now we have the Second Circuit opinion, without a word, literally without a word about the communications from the three Deputy Attorney Generals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1738.199" offset="7056175">That is what the Second Circuit did and that is what petitioners would have this Court do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.761" offset="7078431">An interesting thing about the Second Circuit opinion is that it noted that the Department of Justice representative, Mr. MacGuineas had warned Congress at the hearings not to cover damage actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1759.663" offset="7142066">But the Second Circuit fails to mention that after that warning, after Mr. MacGuineas told them that if they use the language under color of law they would be covering out-of-pocket suits.</text>
