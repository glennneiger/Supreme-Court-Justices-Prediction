            <label>Mr. Garrick F. Cole</label>
            <text syncTime="85.103" offset="444771">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.391" offset="445921">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.351" offset="457832">My name is Garrick Cole.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.631" offset="462952">I'm an Assistant Attorney General, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and I'm here before you today on behalf of the Attorney General of the Commonwealth and its district attorneys, the named defendants in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.139" offset="508928">The Attorney General was sued because he is the chief law enforcement officer in charge with enforcement of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.906" offset="540066">After summarizing briefly the prior proceedings in this case, reviewing the results of the abstention process and stating the significant facts, I propose to concentrate my argument this afternoon on two questions: whether the Court should consider the statute constitutional on its face and whether the District Court's remedy, a declaration of total unconstitutionality and an injunction against enforcement of any aspect of the statute in the first trimester, the second trimester, and the third trimester as to immature minors or as to mature minors, whether the Court should consider that remedy appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.818" offset="695651">We are content to rely upon the arguments in our briefs concerning the other issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.727" offset="715295">The District Court's handling of discovery and the matter of costs on appeal in this Court and our prior appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.734" offset="743299">As the Court may review from the briefs, this matter was commenced in 1974 in the District of Massachusetts before a three-judge District Court as a Civil Rights action seeking invalidation of a state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.364" offset="793872">The Court had this case before it in Jan-- excuse me, in July of-- for decision in July of 1976 which had vacated the District Court's decision on abstention grounds and send it back for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.768" offset="851446">Those further proceedings occurred in 1977 and the case was retried in October of 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.043" offset="888539">In 1978-- in May of 1978, the District Court entered its decision, an order which we seek review here in this Court today, enjoining the statute, as I've said, the enforcement of the statute in its entirety and declaring the statute unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.102" offset="968788">Now, abstention-- the process of abstention which this Court directed the District Court pursue has had a substantial impact on the issues that are before us today.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.823" offset="1011733">As a result of abstention, the meaning of the statute is now clear and its purpose is certain.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.903" offset="1040050">Those purposes, as authoritatively construed by our Supreme Judicial Court, are to promote the best interests of pregnant adolescence and children by stimulating parental consultation accompanied by judicial supervision within the framework of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.580" offset="1110685">As a result of abstention, gone is any suggestion of parental veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.375" offset="1137852">Gone, also, is any question concerning the promptness of judicial proceedings, and gone is any implication of improper or discriminatory intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.306" offset="1189575">The statute, we submit, that, as before the Court today, stands in the long tradition of state legislation enacted to protect and promote the best interests of its minor citizens.</text>

            <text syncTime="324.503" offset="1402420">Well, in any event, what the Court clearly also held was that the district judge was not permitted to find that this was a mature minor capable of -- as an equivalent to an adult so far as being able to decide his -- her best interest by her own lights, and that that was sufficient, therefore, to approve the abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.003" offset="1532406">It had to say that the -- your Supreme Judicial Court held that “no, that's not enough and that's not the judge's function.</text>

            <text syncTime="406.935" offset="1732086">And, it said “assuming that this requirement and this purpose on the part of the Superior Court judge is constitutional, then we believe that it is constant with the long-established tradition of judicial supervision over the welfare of minors that the Court not stop simply at a finding of maturity of informed understanding but, rather, look and see whether there are things which it sees which the child or adolescent may not see for whatever reason, make a determination on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.960" offset="1848278">So, I think that, for that reason, the Supreme Judicial Court's suggestion as to the judge's proper role is constant, once again, with the tradition which we believe this statute stands.</text>

            <text syncTime="631.996" offset="2632370">Well, the situation is that -- your honor is referring to Section 12 (f) of the statute and the answer is yes, as a result of the provision, except for the proposition that Section 12 (s) does not apply to abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.315" offset="2701646">So, the fact that and I think I should perhaps explore that point at this point so that you understand it, Section 12 (f) if a general, as the Supreme Judicial Court says in its opinion, legislative mature minor rule, but it applies only in a very limited set of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.624" offset="2774894">It applies only to those minors who meet its six criteria and their now criteria, to some degree they codify the common law notion of emancipation, but they go a little broader.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.144" offset="2824944">But, they're still quite now and Section 12 (f) on its face does not apply as a result to the vast majority of children, male or female, who live with their families in Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.794" offset="2863606">Now, it's also true, Mr. Justice Blackmun, that it does not apply to abortion or sterilization, neither does Section 12 (e) dealing with methadone maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.251" offset="2901431">The legislature has made a determination, we suggest one which ought to be within its constitutional power to do, that some healthcare decisions, maybe a lot of them, maybe ones which inf -- include very serious surgical procedures or other things of that nature ought to be within the adolescent's ability to decide for his or herself and others should not.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.560" offset="2994636">And, abortion, sterilization, and methadone maintenance are three of those legislatively singled out severe and controversial decisions which the legislature has determined an adolescent should -- or a a child should not be able to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.920" offset="3060046">As a result of the Supreme Judicial Court's ruling, we suggest that there are only two questions of substantive quality before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.230" offset="3097349">First, is the statute invalid simply because, I'm on its face now, it requires parental consultation and notice in every case -- in all cases and is it invalid on its face simply because it requires physicians who attend mature minors to adhere to the same requirements which govern the conduct of physicians who attend immature minors?</text>
            <text syncTime="774.588" offset="3202779">Now, appreciation of the narrowness of these questions, it seems to me, a narrowness that derives from the process of abstention, is a helpful basis for turning to a consideration of the facts at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.799" offset="3263592">The facts are important, we believe, because they show the tenor and complexity of the judgment which the legislature has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.922" offset="3296089">They are predominantly legislative in nature, however, because we are not talking about a -- as applied attack.</text>

            <text syncTime="1134.378" offset="4641917">We feel the -- this matter, as Justice -- Judge Aldrich ruled at trial, was an issue not relevant to a facial attack and, therefore, we do not think that it's a matter which the Court should properly consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.284" offset="4697506">Turning quickly to my argument on the merits, although this is a facial attack on a statute -- state statute, plaintiffs' claims and the District Court's opinion concentrate on very narrow criticisms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.974" offset="4760304">They concentrate upon the effect the statute has on very narrow groups of minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.673" offset="4783083">Now, we don't believe -- we submit, this Court's cases don't permit the District Court to strike a state statute under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.332" offset="4825715">Starting from the beginning, parental consent and its appropriateness, our argument is that it's a longstanding tradition recognized in the law and Mr. Justice Stevens' opinions and opinions of Mr. Justice Brennan in the Carey case note the importance of parental counseling, and the parties all agree that supportive parental counseling is the b -- is in the best interests of minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.617" offset="4938877">So, we start from that proposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1223.934" offset="5000108">The Court may be aware from reading our brief and looking at the record, the American Academy of Pediatrics in 1973 had before it the question precisely of whether minors, adolescents, and children should be able to consent to the performance of abortions and sterilization on their own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.466" offset="5074296">And, the testimony and exhibits on file indicate that the American Academy of Pediatrics decide the answer to that question ought to be no.</text>

            <text syncTime="1318.048" offset="5376585">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.740" offset="5387348">My name is Brian Riley and I represent the appellant, Jane Hunerwadel, who was permitted to intervene in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.587" offset="5414724">Mrs. Hunerwadel was the mother of three unmarried girls of childbearing age.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.753" offset="5431442">At the time this action was commenced, she had no knowledge of the true identity of Mary Moe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.187" offset="5453176">She was permitted to intervene on behalf of herself and as representative of a class of Massachusetts parents having minor girls of childbearing age who might -- who are or might become pregnant and choose not to inform their parents as to the nature of their pregnancy and as to whether or not they were going to seek an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.601" offset="5526841">The intervener contends that the Massachusetts statute, as interpreted by a unanimous decision of the Supreme Judicial Court, is constitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.246" offset="5561428">The intervener contends that the Massachusetts statute is constitutional because it reflects a long line of decisions that this Court, holding that parents have the primary right, duty, and obligation to provide guidance and protection to their minor children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.744" offset="5619419">This Court has only intervened -- interfered with the primary right and duty of parents when the parents have not acted in the best interest of their minor children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.424" offset="5654110">This Court has held that parents are entitled to laws which aids them -- aid them in the discharge of their obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.143" offset="5689010">The Massachusetts statutes consistent with this body of law, first, it provides that the minor must seek parental consent and guidance before she may attain an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.181" offset="5733104">This part of the statute reflects the privacy of the family unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.885" offset="5751912">However, it does provide that a judge of the Superior Court, an inbred mechanism in the statute may grant consent where such consent is in the best interest of the minor child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.248" offset="5797366">The record demonstrates the rationale for such a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.756" offset="5811472">All of the experts agreed that, for a minor girl, an unplanned pregnancy is accompanied by a period of great stress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.692" offset="5839161">Typically, these girls are scared, they're frightened, they're desperate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.053" offset="5856611">One of the experts described these girls as upset, withdrawn, non-communicative, and anxious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.759" offset="5883465">Expert testimony also reveals that such girls are compelled to seek an immediate solution to the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.275" offset="5905512">In short, they want immediate relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.472" offset="5914290">And, yet, the experts state in this case that immediate relief is not proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.480" offset="5930277">There ought to be a period of reflection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.207" offset="5941248">This is where the role of the parents becomes critically important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.868" offset="5955877">All the experts again agree that the great majority of parents who give support and guidance to their children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.145" offset="5980954">They also agreed that parental support and involvement is extremely important and should be encouraged in every instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.852" offset="6007808">It's important that if the girl makes the decision to have the abortion that is the product of reflection and thought, and not the reaction to a crisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.763" offset="6047410">The testimony of the intervener, Mrs. Hunerwadel, demonstrates the important role the parents can play in this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.415" offset="6074055">First, parents are made aware of the pregnancy and they have an opportunity to discuss the pregnancy and the reasons and the circumstances that led to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.208" offset="6109268">That's a fundamental right, if a girl's daughter -- if the daughter is pregnant, the parents ought to be made aware of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.999" offset="6132360">It shouldn't be kept secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.756" offset="6139465">Second, if the pregnancy is symptomatic of other problems, whether they'd be emotional or not, affecting the girl, the parents can begin to initiate steps to resolve those problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.853" offset="6183769">Third, if it's determined that the abortion is in the best interest of the minor girl, the parents will be given the opportunity to assist their daughter in selecting the proper medical facility which best fits the girl's needs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1625.806" offset="6607579">Finally, the parents can ensure that the child receives proper post-abortion counseling and psychiatric care if necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.559" offset="6642584">A majority of the District Court found that the statute's requirement of parental consultation is unconstitutional because some parents may be physically or emotionally unwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.549" offset="6694619">First of all, the record establishes that it is real that a minor's fears about adverse parental reaction are in fact realized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.161" offset="6728997">It is also common that children have many fears about adverse parental reaction which are plainly unfounded and never realized in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.285" offset="6765568">It's common knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.337" offset="6773718">Second, that statute should be -- not be judged on the rare exceptions to the rule but should be judged on the broad sweep of the statute's purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.227" offset="6813320">Majority of the District Court questions the value of giving parents a “last-minute consultation with their daughter.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.333" offset="6841741">The majority seems to imply that if parents have not discussed the problem of the unplanned pregnancy, that it would probably won't be beneficial to give them an opportunity to talk to the girl when it's time that she may want one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.799" offset="6891583">Despite the obvious shortcomings with this statement, it's found better to give parents that last opportunity to help their daughter and to let them have a last-minute consultation possibly with a physician that may only have a narrow clinical interest in the abortion procedure or have solely a monetary interest in the abortion procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1800.718" offset="7307243">Never once has this Court ever advanced the theory that the child should become removed from both the state, removed from the family, and placed into the hands of the third party who is in no way responsible either legally by the parent-child relationship, or by the parens patriae relationship with the state for the welfare of that child in the long run.</text>

            <text syncTime="2088.764" offset="8459452">In a long line of cases, beginning perhaps back as early as Griswold, this Court has clearly established that the right to decide whether or not to terminate a pregnancy is a fundamental right constitutionally protected and insulated from interference unless warranted by some compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.114" offset="8544820">And, in Bellotti against Baird, this Court recognized that the unmarried minor has a fundamental right to an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.420" offset="8578048">Now that right cannot be unduly burdened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.183" offset="8593095">Now, when this case first came before this Court, the burdens imposed by the statute were somewhat unclear, and I don't think that it makes too much difference, Your Honors, whether or not it was unclear either because of the representations that were made concerning the interpretation of the statute at that time by the Attorney General's Office or whether they were unclear as a result of the fact that the District Court failed to abstain, but the fact of the matter is that we now have the benefit or the answers provided by the Supreme Judicial Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to some-nine questions that were certified to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.219" offset="8745232">And, I would suggest respectfully that those burdens fall generally into two categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.110" offset="8768846">First, those required by the necessity for two-parent consent and then those required by what the District Court described and which we adopt as judicial override.</text>

            <text syncTime="2274.364" offset="9201852">And, it makes no difference if the parents have been separated for years and one of the other or both have never displayed any warmth, any love, or any affection for the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.834" offset="9247723">The only exception to that, as far as the statute is concerned, is with respect to the legal definition of desertion, whether or not one of the parents deserted the other parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.658" offset="9295057">And, it makes no difference, may it please the Court, if the most renowned physician or group of physicians or psychiatrists were to attest to irreparable or long-lasting harm to the minor if forced unreasonably or arbitrarily or against her will to have an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.259" offset="9377395">And, according to the statute as it's written in the face of that kind of overwhelming interest as to what would be in the best interest of the child, even a dispassionate judge could not order that that abortion proceed without notification and consultation of the parent-- parents, both of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.278" offset="9477496">In short, this statute that talks in terms of a good cause and the statute that the Supreme Judicial Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts discussed in terms of both the Court and parents conducting themselves in a manner that would be to the best interest of the child would compel notification, consultation, and the obtaining of consent of both parents in total disregard of what every thinking person in a significant number of cases, I submit, would agree was totally irrational and dangerly harm-- dangerously harmful both to the child herself and very well to her parents, as the record in this case shows, because that judge would be forced to direct that notification of that pregnancy be made to parents even though, for example, one of them may be suffering from a very severe hot condition that could very well be triggered into something a lot more serious where that parent would find out that its child was pregnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.628" offset="9762858">As far back as Roe against Wade, reaffirmed by this Court in Carey against Population Services, this Court has spoken in terms of the necessity of there being a compelling state interest as necessary to justify regulation of a right so fundamental as to whether to bear a child in that, more importantly, any such regulation be narrowly drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.960" offset="9868288">Far from being narrowly drawn, we suggest that, obviously, the two-parent consent requirement of this statute is about as broadly drawn as any statute could be.</text>

            <text syncTime="2737.750" offset="11055397">The Massachusetts statute, Section 12 (s), singles out the unmarried minor who chooses abortion for imposition of a uniquely burdensome and discriminatory set of restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.542" offset="11106597">What the state has done is to invidiously classify into one group all minors who have never been married and who want an abortion, and into the other group every other kind of minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.998" offset="11160409">Now, these other kinds of minors consist of, first, any minor who wants to continue her pregnancy, second, any minor who has ever been married and who wants an abortion and, third, any minor who wants any kind of medical treatment however serious other than abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.050" offset="11232611">For all these other minors, Massachusetts either has no requirement of parental involvement at all or has requirements which are much less burdensome than those imposed by Section 12 (s).</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.835" offset="11283707">Now, let me illustrate this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.526" offset="11290499">The case of the minor who wants to continue her pregnancy is obviously the most simple.</text>

            <text syncTime="2963.219" offset="11957248">In other words, change it to require one-parent consent or, in the case of a mature minor, hold it invalid as to that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2985.361" offset="12045855">Second, that it would be unprecedented for the Federal Court to take a statute, eliminate its construction and, indeed, its text and rewrite it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.367" offset="12077829">And, third, you would have here by way of the construction suggested, distinguishing between mature and immature minor, a criminal statute which would make a physician's potential exposure to criminal liability turn on whether he correctly assessed maturity versus immaturity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.792" offset="12139583">Just as this last month, this Court considered a statute where a physician could or could not be criminally liable depending on how he assess the question of viability.</text>

            <text syncTime="3033.425" offset="12238117">The result of the Massachusetts overall system is that, for any case you can think of, except the unmarried minor wanting an abortion, Massachusetts law either leaves it up to the minor and her physician or, at most, requires one parent's consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.068" offset="12304677">Section 12 (s) stands in stark contrast in this otherwise liberal approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.085" offset="12328709">Under Section 12 (s) and only under that statute, an unmarried minor could actually be forced to bear an unwanted child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.907" offset="12360056">And, the consequence of letting the statute go into effect, as the facts found by the District Court show, which have not been challenged as clearly erroneous, the consequence would be to deter unmarried minors from seeking legal abortions, to force some of them to travel out of state or into the hands of backroom abortionists, and to force still others to bear unwanted and usually illegitimate children.</text>

            <text syncTime="3175.519" offset="12806437">That's -- there, at least, is no significant state interest in that distinction because the two-parent consent rule here is not only intermently burdensome in itself, adding an additional consent requirement, but it triggers the minor's exposure to all the other burdens of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.447" offset="12866205">For example, the discriminatory burden of judicial veto where, in the case other than abortion, a minor may obtain the medical treatment she wants upon the concurrent consents of herself, to the extent of her capacity, one parent, and her physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.684" offset="12927122">But, uniquely under this statute, a judge may veto those concurrent consents even if the other parent has not opposed the abortion in Court but merely declines to execute the required consent form, and the statute requires that a consent form be executed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3223.836" offset="12999743">Mr. Henn, it may -- probably is not terribly important, but I wonder if either in presentations to the legislature on the arguments in the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts there was any -- discretion of any kind about the predicament of the physician who performs the abortion after this Supreme Judicial Court decision, assuming it is sustained, who is later confronted with a malpractice suit or a battery suit by a 14-year-old or 15-year-old girl after she's matured several years later on the grounds that she was incapable of giving consent and, therefore, it would be a battery, in most states, if there was no adequate consent?</text>

            <label>Mr. John H. Henn</label>
            <text syncTime="3278.951" offset="13220216">Well, if Section 12 (s) were invalidated, I think -- in other words, if the District Court opinion in this case were upheld, then I think the physician would have a good faith defense under the, I believe, third paragraph of Section 12 (f) which, in my view, ought to apply which would provide a good faith defense either if he was reasonably mislead by the minor as to her competence or mislead as to her age.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.971" offset="13320317">Otherwise, it is, and indeed would be, the common law rule as to all medical procedures comparing the common law mature minor rule with the more traditional common law battery rule that a physician's judgment, with respect to maturity, is subject to exposure, if he errs and decides the minor is mature, to a possible battery suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.207" offset="13405268">I think there should properly be a good faith defense in that, and I can't say the common law itself is clear in part because the mature minor rule was only announced in this case by the Supreme Judicial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.935" offset="13452184">Now, the deterrent burdens which my brother, Mr. Balliro, has discussed at some length are ones which, in our view, make this statute a statute which is not safe from the Court's holding in Danforth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.852" offset="13519788">The suggestion has been that Section 12 (s), its provision for going to Court as an alternative somehow makes this case different from Danforth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.289" offset="13553539">But, the burdens of going into Court were found, as a fact, to be severely detrimental, and I call the Court's attention to the findings at pages 1,001 and 1,002 of 450 (f) set in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.319" offset="13609650">Those findings were that the burden of going to Court is a “heavy burden,” that the -- that an expert witness testified, credibly and without contradiction, that going into Court would be severely detrimental to the minor, testified that if the minor -- that most minors, at least if obliged to get parent's consent would not -- or many minors would not go to Court but, instead, would seek illegal alternatives and, quite importantly, found that if a minor did go to Court, she was in an impossible situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.951" offset="13748203">If she prevailed, that is, she beat her parents in Court, that was hardly going to help her family situation and, if she lost, if her parents forced her to bear an unwanted child, that was hardly going to help her family situation either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.992" offset="13804314">Now, Your Honor, I would like -- Your Honors, I would like to turn to the suggested state interest which appellants have proposed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.741" offset="13839318">The first suggested state interest is that of protecting against immature decision making. I submit this state interest is already met by existing Massachusetts law which provides for physicians to make individual assessments of maturity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.174" offset="13901072">And, surely, the requirement of parental notice when, by hypothesis against a minor's best interest, not to mention judicial veto of a mature minor's decision, have nothing whatever to do with protecting against immature decision making.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.998" offset="13960422">Indeed, where the state truly concerned to prevent immature decisions, this statute is obviously under inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.042" offset="13992605">It does not impose any requirements even if consultation or counseling on any minor who wants to have a child, however foolish or immature that wish may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.754" offset="14031370">And, similarly, the statute sweeps far beyond any requirement of encouraging parental consultation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.760" offset="14059478">It requires consent or notice of a lawsuit in every case even if, by hypothesis, harmful to the minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.766" offset="14099498">An example of a consultation statue is attached to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.424" offset="14114126">Our brief is the buffed colored brief, as the Maryland statute and, while the factual workings of that statute I can't speak to, that is the -- at least an example of the kind of statute which would encourage consultation in the normal case, but leave it up to the physician to decide whether to dispense with it in cases where parental cases would be harmful to the minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.809" offset="14191658">There are no judicial proceedings required and the physician may not be made criminally liable for his decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.699" offset="14223214">As to the matter of remedy, the District Court was surely correct in invalidating the statute in its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.706" offset="14251217">The claims of all unmarried minors who wish abortion were before the District Court and those are the minors to whom the statute applies, there is no as applied analysis therefore, that would be appropriate and this Court has not applied such analysis in its review of prior abortion statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.371" offset="14321852">In summary, we submit that the District Court properly invalidated the entire statute as imposing undue burdens and unjustified discriminations with respect to a minor's abortion choice.</text>
