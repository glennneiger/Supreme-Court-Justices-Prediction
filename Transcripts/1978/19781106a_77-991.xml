            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll hear argument first this morning in 991 Califano and the consolidated case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter Buscemi</label>
            <text syncTime="18.008" offset="175417">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.169" offset="188061">The principal issue in these consolidated cases is whether the Constitution forbids Congress from providing that certain federal welfare benefits should be pay only for those months during which the recipient is in the United States for at least part of the month.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.738" offset="254307">Cases are here on appeal from United States District Court for the Southern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.456" offset="277191">The named appellee in 77-991, Grace Aznavorian receives benefits under the Supplemental Security Income program.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.285" offset="316479">That program was established in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.598" offset="329749">It was designed to consolidate and improve upon the previously existing cooperative federal state aide programs for the aged, the blind, and the disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.722" offset="370291">The Social Security Administration was assigned the task of administrating a new program and the Federal Government agreed to bear the entire cause of providing basic monthly benefit levels for persons who could establish financial need and who could satisfy the requirements of aged, blindness or disability provided in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.014" offset="455450">The benefit levels under the Supplemental Security Income program are set by reference to the cost of living in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.141" offset="483976">In 1974, Aznavorian's monthly benefits were a $146.00 today after a several cost of living increases there approximately $190.00 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.445" offset="533191">I'd like to emphasis to the outset that the Supplemental Security Income program involved in this case is a federal welfare program involving Government grants to persons needing public financial assistance to live in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.565" offset="597661">It's completely unrelated to the Social Security old age, survivors and disability insurance program.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.494" offset="629321">Unlike that program which is funded out of a trust fund from employer and employee contributions the Supplemental Security Income program is funded out of general revenues and its only similarity to the Social Security Insurance program is that there both are administered by the Social Security Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.867" offset="702882">Aznavorian began receiving benefits in January 1st, 1974, the date that the SSI program became effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.827" offset="738722">She was converted from her previous coverage under a California welfare program for the disabled and therefore she began receiving benefits immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.176" offset="784071">Shortly thereafter on July 21st, 1974, she left the United States and travel to Guadalajara, Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.010" offset="815417">She did not return to the country until September 1st, 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.412" offset="832972">As a consequence to that trip, she lost her SSI benefits for August and September of 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.711" offset="862229">The Social Security Administration refused to pay benefits for those months because of Section 1611 (f) of the Social Security Act which is the statutory provision that's at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.034" offset="911548">Congress adopted Section 1611 (f) because it wanted to ensure that federal welfare benefits were paid only to people who actually need them to live in United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.091" offset="955747">The legislature did not forbid SSI recipients from traveling abroad provided only that where otherwise eligible persons decide to take foreign trips for an extended period of time they may not receive welfare benefits for the time they are outside the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.203" offset="1024188">This purpose to provide public assistance only to persons who need it to support themselves in United States is accomplished by Section 1611 (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="239.311" offset="1060655">That Section contains two sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.146" offset="1071940">The first sentence provides, “That no person shall be considered eligible for SSI benefits for any month during all of which he or she is outside the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="256.786" offset="1130559">Aznavorian lost her SSI benefits for August 1974 because of the operation of this sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.636" offset="1157935">The second sentence of Section 1611 (f) provides, “That once an otherwise eligible recipient is outside the country for 30 consecutive days, he is treated as remaining outside the country until he has returned to United States and stayed here for 30 consecutive days.”</text>
            <text syncTime="283.132" offset="1235884">Aznavorian lost her benefits for September 1974 because of the operation of this second sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.784" offset="1266500">Now, I'd like to make one thing clear about the way the second sentence of Section 1611 (f) operates before I go any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.129" offset="1299937">If a person is outside the country for 30 consecutive days, he is treated as remaining outside the country until he's returned and stayed in United States for 30 consecutive days.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.434" offset="1337135">But this does not mean that he cannot receive SSI benefits for any of that 30-day waiting period.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.022" offset="1367437">If the 30-day waiting period expires before the end of the month, the person can receive his full SSI benefits for that month.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.718" offset="1402232">Thus, a person who leaves for example on June 10th and returns to United States on July 20th.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.665" offset="1430026">If he's still in the country on August 19th, 30 days later, he'll receive benefits for the full month of August.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.327" offset="1456671">The provision is designed only to equalize treatment between people who are outside the country for a full calendar month and those who are out for a period longer than 30 days which spans two calendar months and therefore therein the country for part of each.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="387.746" offset="1654366">I see.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="390.469" stopTime="853.837">
            <label>Mr. Peter Buscemi</label>
            <text syncTime="390.469" offset="1665233">Now, it's the Secretary's position that Section 1611 (f) is rationally related to the legitimate Government purpose of limiting welfare payments to persons who actually need them to live in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.160" offset="1719986">Appellees in the District Court believe however that the operation of Section 1611 (f) involves an unconstitutional infringement on the right to travel outside the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.698" offset="1778186">Appellees after exhausting their available administrative remedies filed as class action and allege that the suspension of SSI benefits to otherwise eligible recipients who are outside the country for 30 or more consecutive days is an improper penalty on the exercise of what she called the fundamental constitutional right to foreign travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.523" offset="1869511">The District Court did not completely accept appellee's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.554" offset="1885602">It observed that international travel has traditionally been subject to more controls to interstate travel and said that the right to travel internationally should not be equated or put on an equal footing with the right to travel interstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.680" offset="1950072">However the Court did decide that the right to international travel is a basic constitutional right and therefore that any governmental restriction, no matter how minor on such travel must bear a fair and substantial relationship to a legitimate Government purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.606" offset="2013811">The Court concluded that Congress could have chosen less drastic means to prevent fraudulent claims for SSI benefits and to ensure that such benefits are paid only to United States residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.358" offset="2060831">The Court therefore declared Section 1611 (f) unconstitutional and directed the Secretary to pay Aznavorian the benefit she would have received in August of 9th -- and September 1974 had it not been for her trip to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.302" offset="2124570">We believe that the District Court erred in applying this unusually stringent standard of review to Section 1611 (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="512.476" offset="2153305">The Court has repeatedly held that statutory classifications of this kind in social welfare programs should be sustained if they bear a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.301" offset="2200534">Indeed, in Califano against Jobst decided just last term the Court may clear that the validity of a particular classification must be measured against the rational base standard even if the classification may have some incidental effect on a constitutionally protected right, in that case, the right to marry.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.609" offset="2281827">Another case decided last term, Califano against Gautier Torres, demonstrates the District Court's error in this case in a signing a special constitutional status to the right to travel abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.356" offset="2332818">As the Court said in Gautier Torres, the right to international travel does not enjoy the same degree of constitutional protection as the right to travel interstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.005" offset="2367404">The right to travel outside the country is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and such can be regulated within the bounds of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.649" offset="2405961">The statement runs directly counted.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.129" offset="2411917">We submit to the District Court's holding in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.452" offset="2437204">Now, the District Court cites three Supreme Court cases for its proposition that in a specially strong showing is required to justify any infringement on the right travel abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.998" offset="2483388">None of those cases support the result reached below.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.639" offset="2497912">Kent against Dulles, the first of the cases, was a statutory interpretation case that simply held that the Secretary of State did not have the power under the statutes passed in 1952 and 1956 to deny passport solely on the basis of personal beliefs, political views, political expressions.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.998" offset="2587355">Aptheker against the Secretary of State recognized Congress' right to regulate travel abroad but simply held that a particular exercise of that power, the Subversive Activities Control Act went too far by making it a crime for any member of any communist organization to use or even apply for a passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.563" offset="2665618">And finally, Zemel against Rusk sited by appellees in a District Court not only acknowledge the congressional power to regulate travel outside the country but upheld the constitutionality of the Passport Act of 1926 to the extent that it was interpreted to permit the Secretary of State to refuse to validate passports for persons who want to travel to particular countries if the Secretary found that such travel might be injurious to American foreign policy positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.780" offset="2790484">In none of those cases that the Court indicated that there was a special standard that needed to applied any time there was an infringement on the right to travel abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.248" offset="2832384">Its worth pointing out I think that Section 1611 (f) does not prohibit any foreign travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.377" offset="2852864">It's absolutely neutral with respect to trips of 30 days or less.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.125" offset="2871881">And with respect to longer trips, the Congress has chosen to provide only that no SSI benefits will be paid for months during all of which the recipient is outside the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.759" offset="2934366">As a practical matter of course, the SSI recipient's ability to travel abroad for lengthy period is -- periods is limited by financial factors that are unrelated to Section 1611 (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="719.304" offset="2980551">In order to receive SSI benefits at all, the recipient must demonstrate that he has less than $1500 in personal resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.914" offset="3023078">Foreign trips lasting longer than the 30-day period are unlikely to be within financial reach of most SSI recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.541" offset="3053484">And if such trips are made possible in some cases by the availability of accommodations with friends or relatives outside the country, this is precisely the kind of situation in which the payment of SSI benefits to persons outside the country would be inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.707" offset="3122239">We believe as I said before that Section 1611 (f) is rationally related to a legitimate congressional goal providing financial aide to persons who need it to live in United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.251" offset="3172394">We also think as we've stated in the brief that is related to the purpose of paying SSI benefits only to United States residents, a purpose that appellees concede as a legitimate one.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.232" offset="3224325">Section 1611 (f) makes it unnecessary for the Social Security Administration to decide each time a recipient leaves the country whether that person is abandoning his United States residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.641" offset="3273958">The Social Security Administration simply stops payments after the recipient has been outside the country for a full month.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.148" offset="3311992">And we believe that this is a rational legislative judgment that should be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.485" offset="3329337">Now, we've also argued in our brief that the District Court's -- a word of retroactive monetary relief was improper because Congress did not choose to waive sovereign immunity for claims that benefits were unconstitutionally denied under -- even when they were denied under a statutory -- in accordance with a statutory provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.027" offset="3435499">We've also argued that the District Court's limitation of the relief to -- in currently needy members of the class was a legitimate exercise of the District Court's equitable discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.124" offset="3479907">Unless the Court has questions on first part of the brief or any of these other two, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.</text>
