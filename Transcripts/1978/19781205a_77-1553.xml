            <label>Mr. William F. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="44.617" offset="281788">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.306" offset="296626">This is an employment discrimination case in which the Fire Department of the County of Los Angeles was found liable in order to make future hires in accordance with a quota for blacks and Mexican Americans until the Fire Department received -- achieved racial parity with the surrounding County population.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.427" offset="365066">The case raises the issue of whether 42 U.S.C., Section 1981 embodies constitutional equal protection standards and requires a showing of discriminatory intent to establish a violation of that statute or whether Title VII standards in which intent is irrelevant or applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.461" offset="437164">Since the discriminatory hiring took place prior to the March 1972, effective date of Title VII as to public agencies, the case raises the issue of whether through 1981 Title VII standards could be applied retroactively as to public agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.711" offset="502262">The other fundamental issue is whether the quota hiring order mandating 40% minority hires until racial parity is achieved, so within the remedial authority of the trial court under the facts and the findings of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.970" offset="555238">This employment case is different from others of recent vinigen (ph) that comes before the Court with an express finding by the trial judge that the County of Los Angeles had not engaged in any intentional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.416" offset="605080">The County had long administered a traditional civil service aptitude tests for fire fighters as well as other applicants for County jobs similar to those utilized by the District of Columbia in Washington v. Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.118" offset="659832">Other testing criteria for this particular job were great at oral interview, a 5'7” minimum height standard and physical and mental tests -- medical tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.034" offset="695463">This action was brought in January of 1973 by plaintiffs, none of whom were prior unsuccessful applicants for the position.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.907" offset="727019">And they challenged only two exam criteria, two written exams, one given in 1969 and one given in 1972 and the height standard, as these were the only exam criteria shown to have a disproportionate impact on minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.722" offset="786265">Now the administration of the 1972 case was somewhat unique because after the 1969 exam, the County of Los Angeles in an attempt to increase minority representation in the Fire Department and to reduce any disparate impact of their tests, decided to go to a random selection method.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.383" offset="856900">In that regard, they administered the written tests in January of 72, graded it, 97% of the applicants passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.765" offset="890441">The County's intention then was to draw by random selection applicants from those that passed, the 97% that passed and then proceed with them through the regular process, the oral interviews and other portions of exam which had not shown to have any adverse impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.596" offset="953762">Unfortunately, the random selection method was enjoined by another lawsuit on the basis that it violated the civil service provisions. Consequently, there was no hiring by the County for two years during the pendency of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.068" offset="999633">Finally in desperate straits because of the shortfall in fire fighter personnel, the County proposed to interview the top 540 applicants on the written exam for the purpose of filling the immediate requirements of the Fire Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.204" offset="1064208">There was no hiring however for approximately two years prior to the effective date of Title VII as to public agencies until after the judgment in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.143" offset="1103914">The law – the threat of the lawsuit intervened and there was -- and consequently the County never did effectuate the intent to interview the top 544 applicants, but proceed with them all through the remaining stages of the examination process and no adverse impact nor was there any discrimination in the compiling of the subsequent eligibility list.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.613" offset="1185834">During the trial, the court found no intentional discrimination on behalf of the county, but in reliance on Title VII standards, held the county liable because their written exams in 1969 and 1972 had a disproportionate impact on minorities and had not had been validated.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.875" offset="1250826">The court upheld the height standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.247" offset="1260335">The court went on to impose a remedy for the purpose of eliminating or remitting alleged past discrimination, a remedy of 20% blacks and 20% Mexican Americans hired until complete racial parity was achieved between the County Fire Department and the community, the County of Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.466" offset="1337240">The Ninth Circuit on re-hearing raised -- on re-hearing after the County raised the intent issue in the wake of this Court's decision in Washington v. Davis, reversed the trial court’s height finding, upheld the court order and appalled the finding of discrimination in the use of the tests on Title VII grounds, notwithstanding the lack of discriminatory intent and expressing the holding that intent was irrelevant under Section 1981 as it is under Title VII and that there was no operation of the distinction between Title VII liability and liability based on Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.099" offset="1471718">We believe that the Circuit Court seriously erred in holding that Title VII liability principles applied to Section 1981 and that no intent to discriminate need be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.632" offset="1529919">This Court in Griggs versus Duke Power articulated judicially the disproportionate impact standards based upon this Court's interpretation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.187" offset="1596165">The issue in this case then really revolves around the intent of the 39th Congress and the original enactment of the statute we now know as Section 1981, and the effect of any of Congress's enactment of Title VII in 1964.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="388.447" offset="1657187">Mr. Stewart, you have undoubtedly seen the Solicitor General's amicus brief in this case suggesting that the case boils down to a lot less than it seem to after the revised opinion of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.264" offset="1712462">Are you going to discuss that at some point in your argument?</text>

            <text syncTime="408.169" offset="1736077">I did also discuss it in my reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.890" offset="1766902">Well, perhaps I could address it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.200" offset="1776201">I just simply to state that I think the government's position was wrong on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.473" offset="1793233">The quota hiring order in this case designed to -- was clearly designed to remedy past discrimination and was clearly predicated upon a finding of violation of Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.680" offset="1830118">That clearly raises the issue of the standard of liability under Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.311" offset="1848613">We feel it has to be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.200" offset="1856136">If this -- if the Court determines that constitution equal protection standards apply to Section 1981, then under the trials court's finding in this case that there has been no deliberate indiscrimination then we believe that the quota hiring order must fall in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.718" offset="1922278">The quota hiring order is still in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.803" offset="1930533">The County has been obeying that quota of hiring order since judgment was entered in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.320" offset="1948609">The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals did not disapprove the quota hiring order.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.871" offset="1966895">It expressly approved of the quota hiring order, stating, we do not necessarily believe that the 1:1:3 hiring ratio is incorrect.</text>

            <label>Mr. William F. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="748.711" offset="3098206">It is a [Laughter] – there have many written about it sir, but I think it is a critical issue that is really before the Court because the quota hiring order is predicated upon the finding of a 1981 violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.057" offset="3163617">And as I will note in the moment, I think there is significant problems with finding no intent standard under Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.408" offset="3197053">The adverse consequences on the enforcement procedures of Title I and Title VII for one, the effect on cases that are currently pending with other governmental agencies, they have been sued around 1971 and 1972 under, before Title VII become effective as to their discriminatory acts in which the Court said that intent was not required and it applies, the question of the applicability retroactively of Title VII to public agencies who do not become subject to Title VII until 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.442" offset="3341145">But we believe that Congress in 19 -- 39th Congress when they enacted Section 1981 could not have had the Title VII adverse impact validation standards that arose through the court's Griggs decision in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.652" offset="3410004">The purpose of Section 1981 was to remove the legal disabilities of blacks and to provide them with equal protection of the laws and certainly many civil service tests have administered by the federal government subsequent to the enactment of Section 1981 that probably had the desperate impact on minorities and the Congress could not have intended to outlaw those tests simply by showing that they had a disparate impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.115" offset="3523793">The impact of the enactment of Title VII in 1964 on 1981, I submit was very little if any.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.709" offset="3566216">Congress considered 1981 to be a separate and independent statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.081" offset="3587741">There appears to be no indication that they intended to change that statute or to remove that remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.683" offset="3614072">This Court in Johnson v. Railway Express, held that the statutes certainly were overlapping and related, but not necessarily that they employed the same standards of liability, certainly they are related to the same end of eliminating discrimination, they apply to racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.263" offset="3688469">They both apply to employment discrimination and they both apply to intentional discrimination, but that is not to say that they both apply to Title VII standards of liability predicated upon showing of disparate impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.955" offset="3747192">The Constitution itself overlaps to those answers well that this Court held in Washington versus Davis that the constitutional standards for discrimination were not the same as those for Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.278" offset="3800482">The argument is raised that they should construe Title VII in pari materia with the Civil Rights Act; those Civil Rights Act now in Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.813" offset="3850637">But this strikes a rather discordant note because the 1964 Civil Rights Act expressly excluded public agencies such as the County of Los Angeles for its coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.312" offset="3892642">So you cannot engraft into Section 1981 Title VII standards by leaning on the rather weak stem of the court -- of the Congress's enactment of Title VII in 1964 because they obviously intended not to extend that coverage to public agencies until 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.534" offset="3973517">To hold that the intent is irrelevant under Section 1981, I think would have adverse consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.920" offset="3999013">It would permit circumvention of Title VII procedures that were laboriously debated in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.902" offset="4018970">It would extend Title VII liability standards to employers that Congress intended to exclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.073" offset="4055646">Cases have come up recently in the lower courts, Johnson Versus Alexander where the government argued that the army was not subject to Title VII, but if a suit could be brought under 1981 and apply Title VII standards that way then the distinction or the exclusion of the military from the coverage of Section -- of Title VII in 1964 is relatively meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.375" offset="4144880">Similarly in Johnson versus Ryder (ph), the claim was made that a bona fide seniority system was illegal, by attempting to apply Title VII standards through Section 1981 despite this Court's ruling in the Teamsters case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.749" offset="4222412">The recognizing an instant – an intent standard for Section 1981 will not adversely impact upon the enforcement of equal employment opportunities because Title VII is now applicable to public and private agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.412" offset="4293047">The plaintiff still has the benefit of Section 1981 in private and public cases where you can show we believe deliberate discriminatory intent does not mean that statistics are not prohibitive in Section 1981 actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.963" offset="4343202">This Court indicated in Arlington Heights, they can be prohibitive for proving the question of intent, but that is a far cry from saying that the Title VII standards of -- having to show job relating to supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.693" offset="4406105">Now, I would like to address the quota issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.135" offset="4423868">As I stated in response to an earlier question, the quota was predicated upon a violation of Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.507" offset="4445393">It would have followed that if there has been no violation of Section 1981 because there has been no showing of intent, the quota would fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.445" offset="4481128">Now, we are mindful of the decisions of the lower courts, including the observation of this Court in Bakke that a quota hiring order may be appropriate as a remedy in cases of proven discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.914" offset="4535045">The issue at bar however in regards to the quota is not the appropriate, that is quotas in general, but whether the one entered in this case was over broad, not properly tailored to the extent of the proven wrong, and was in excess of the court's remedial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.625" offset="4605889">There is clear distinction that has to be made between liability and remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.721" offset="4622294">The quota is a remedy and it's not a device to achieve racial parity, but it must be related to the proven wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.304" offset="4652596">The proven wrong in this particular case was the 1969 test, which had a disparate impact on Mexican Americans in the high standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.348" offset="4700766">The quota remedy should be applied with caution because it impacts on innocent third-parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.100" offset="4723754">It is not like applying remedy of back pay where it is a question between the employer and the employee, but the quota remedy obviously adversely impacts on innocent third-parties who have been denied a job if they were not a member of the or beneficiaries of the quota themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.819" offset="4802644">So we must balance the rights of the victims as against the rights of the innocent third-parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.550" offset="4821556">Judging the quota order in this case, we feel that it's clearly excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.082" offset="4843708">It was imposed to remedy past discrimination and not to assist the plaintiffs, none of whom had been prior applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.515" offset="4869413">It was not limited to the actual ascertainable victims of any discriminatory practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.792" offset="4894490">It was designed to cure presumed discrimination no matter how remote and time it may have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.020" offset="4915493">The County Fire Department was composed of individuals who have been hired over 25-30 year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.900" offset="4942973">It is one of those positions like of law enforcement where there is a concern for long-term retirement and so forth, and so there is little turn over in that department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.236" offset="4996368">And so the quota order in this case presumes a pattern of discrimination extending far back beyond the 1969 test, even beyond Title VII's enactment in 1964, discrimination that was totally unproven.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.329" offset="5056658">And the anomaly of the case is that individuals who may have been victimized by any discrimination would have their claims time barred as they are not filed in time, but minorities who have not actually suffered discrimination would get a preference under this quota at the expense of whites and other minorities, not black and Mexican Americans, would have the beneficiaries of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.343" offset="5164701">Thus we feel that the quota in this particular case is now achieved the character of a device to achieve racial balance and not a remedy for proven discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.517" offset="5213393">In fact, the finding say that it is designed to cure past discrimination as indicated by the racial imbalance of the department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.148" offset="5283924">And of course as has been mentioned by questions from Your Honors, the fact that the plaintiffs have no standing to represent past applicants, indicates that the quota order was not designed to remedy any discrimination as far as they were concerned, but was designed to remedy presumed past discrimination, discrimination that apparently the court felt would have resulted in the County Department being at racial parity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.435" offset="5413073">There is no evidence as to what the racial composition of the County Fire Department would have been, even it had no discriminatory practices if any had been utilized in past years, no consideration of the racial characteristics and demography of the County of Los Angeles whether there has been an increase or decrease in blacks or Mexican Americans over the years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2913.119" offset="11755813">The problem that we face here is not only this confusion on every one's part as to whether past, present, and future or just present and future applicants where represented, but in addition, we have the problem that there has been a remand on, assuming there is to be a hiring order, how much the hiring order should be.</text>

            <text syncTime="3026.902" offset="12210970">For example, it is important to note in this case that the test used by the county that was in the process of being applied to the current applicants, were also used in earlier years.</text>

            <text syncTime="3711.470" offset="14949230">But I have continued throughout this trail including briefs filed with the Ninth Circuit both times, objecting to the standing of the plaintiffs to represent the class and it is not merely a question of pleading, because there is no past applicants that are named defendants in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3732.422" offset="15033031">Well that is right sure sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.670" offset="15042017">But we have raised these points continuously and we have continuously lost on all of these points, the 1981 issue, the application of Title VII, the standing issue and everything through with the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.767" offset="15090395">We hope that we will not lose the case before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.915" offset="15103039">Well, I think the issues on Section 1981 and the intent are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.206" offset="15124146">The counsel indicates he would like to matter remanded and that will bring of course the 1981 intent issues to the fore again.</text>
