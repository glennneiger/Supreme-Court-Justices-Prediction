            <label>Mr. David H. Young</label>
            <text syncTime="93.933" offset="479065">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.653" offset="494007">The dispute in this case arises as a result of a March 1st, 1973 conversion that the State of Texas Department of -- what was then known as Department of Public Welfare made in the methods and procedures that it used to calculate a standard of need in Aid to Families with Dependent Children program.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.543" offset="581569">States are permitted by Section 601 in Title 42 that Section 401 of the Social Security Act to define the standard of need that they will utilize in the AFDC program and this Court has frequently stated and restated ever since King against Smith that states have that latitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.884" offset="678954">Before, the March 1st, 1973 conversion, the state's method of determining an individual's need for AFDC went through the four steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.145" offset="735901">First, a maximum standard of need was established which is not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.439" offset="757112">Second, a personal needs allowance, a shelter allowance and a utilities allowance were combined that portion is in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.641" offset="797968">Third, they percentage reduction factor was applied and fourth, the amount of any none exempt income was deducted from the -- what was referred to this has recognized needs which was a product to those first three steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.755" offset="862438">Much of that, of course was outlined in your prior decision in Jefferson against Hackney.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.329" offset="892740">The problem arises because of one step that Texas went through with regard to the shelter and utilities allowances that it allowed to be included in the standard of need that were being perforation.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.398" offset="968913">The method that Texas used was to count the number of individuals in the household without regard whether they were eligible or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.251" offset="1012381">And then subtract the appropriate per capita share for those people who were determined to be ineligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.798" offset="1050520">After March 1st, 1973, Texas has conversion provided for a flat grant system.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.565" offset="1077582">There's essentially no longer any dispute in this case that Texas can have a flat grants that other states can have a flat grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.208" offset="1112168">The shelter and utilities figures that Texas used and that from which this lawsuit comes were consolidated with the personal needs figure and average.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.072" offset="1175698">Neither the consolidation per se nor the averaging is an issue what the state did under the new system was say that you get so many dollars per eligible recipient rather than the former method of taking all the individuals in the household and then backing out a per capita share for those who were determined to be ineligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.757" offset="1302444">I think simply so I characterized the new method is just simple addition you add up the numbers for the eligible people there whereas before you added up numbers for everyone and then back out a share for the ineligible and that's the perforation.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.392" offset="1368900">It's important --</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="317.803" offset="1374542">What practical difference in that change?</text>

            <label>Mr. David H. Young</label>
            <text syncTime="320.920" offset="1387081">I hope to demonstrate there is no practical difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.646" offset="1409964">But it has been widely assumed that there is and that is enlarged part of basis for the Fifth Circuit's decision and I'm seeking an overturn.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.021" offset="1451447">It is important in that regard to keep perforation and economies of scale is separate questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.813" offset="1482585">There's no dispute that the state can utilize economy's scale in establishing its need standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.854" offset="1526784">Economy's of scale by the way is not a justification for perforation despite the contention that occasionally occurs that economy's scale is just another way of saying the state assumes the availability of income and runs contrary to everything the Court has said since King against Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.460" offset="1613197">In the District Court, respondents file suit against the new system saying, one, that it violated Section 602 (a) (23) or the cost of living increase requirement of the Social Security Act to use a flat grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.145" offset="1683937">The flat grant being what I described is just a simple addition of the average numbers rather than the former method of establishing a figure for individual needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.908" offset="1742973">And also alleged that the state's new system violated 602 (a) (7) which is the provision that requires the states to deduct available income.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.875" offset="1798875">606 (b) which has to do is whether or not the states can make restrictive payments and which we say is not an issue here and 602 (a) (23) which is the cost of living requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.384" offset="1844955">They said that by including the prorated members will obscured the standard of need and therefore do not give a true cost of living raises required by 602 (a) (23).</text>
            <text syncTime="448.163" offset="1896051">The District Court took jurisdiction of the alleged Social Security Act violations under 28 U.S.C. 13434.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.635" offset="1945893">And the Fifth Circuit's decision -- and they were required to judge view was required to by the Fifth Circuit's decision in Gomez against Florida Employment Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.918" offset="1999078">The rights involved which were found to be cognizable under 13434 were rights at the Fifth Circuit characterizes rights of an essentially personal nature referring to the need to have food, the need to have a shelter a place to live and things such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.065" offset="2079640">But the District Court found far that your petitioner is here on the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.712" offset="2106180">After the District Court entered its opinion, the respondents here attempted to reopen and amend their case to raise a constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.256" offset="2152364">They have not alleged any constitutional issue to the time the District Court made its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.868" offset="2186846">However, in considering their motions to reopen and motions for live to amend the court said that the demands of its docket do not allow a party who has had its civilian court to restructure and replead its case merely because it is obtained in adverse decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="552.324" offset="2312652">As I understand the general practice where effectively a jurisdictional basis or pleading are allowed to be amended at some time during the appellate process it is where the Superior Court and the Appellate Court is looking for an alternative means to uphold the decision of the court below that's already been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.569" offset="2409618">And in this case, the District Court said that they not only had and raise it or briefed it or argued it but that there was no proof in the record to support what the District Court took to be their Due Process claim but which was not characterizes Due Process or anything else in their motions for leave to amend their reopen.</text>

            <text syncTime="664.406" offset="2761017">What I meant by that is that when I did my petition for certiorari you'll notice that all that was available to me as to Gonzalez against Young was a short summary in United States law weaken my petition was based on Andrews against Maher and Randall v. Goldmark subsequently and prior to the preparation of my brief and did obtain a copy of Gonzales against Young and Alexandria.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.056" offset="2859551">I hope to come in on the respondent's petition about it but I cannot improve on or share any additional light.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.513" offset="2889435">I think really on the rational that the Third Circuit is and I just stand on it with the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.732" offset="2922350">To the extent it addresses the issue I raise which is 13434 not 13433.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.690" offset="2954115">The -- and with regard to that distinction between the two possible basis for jurisdiction, the Fifth Circuit found with the District Court that it was subsection 4 which was a basis for jurisdiction not subsection 3 and they declined to find the existence, excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.938" offset="3035094">Now, the subsection 3 claim even though by that time it arguably been briefed by respondents in the District Court and it have been repeatedly urged as a method to reopen the whole case and was sought to -- by them to be considered by the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.569" offset="3101654">Fifth Circuit said, That's not what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.489" offset="3109282">We have a subsection 4 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.960" offset="3119208">But they did on one issue in the merits overturn the Fifth Circuit on the perforation question and say that perforation was an impermissible assumption of income except when the recipient lives with none dependent relatives in the later shelter.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.078" offset="3207711">My petition for certiorari was intentionally and knowingly limited to as to jurisdiction 13434.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.309" offset="3256613">I also alleged that the Fifth Circuit fail to appreciate this Court's opinion in Jefferson against Hackney where is considered what the real requirements of 602 (a) (23) were and determine that Texas that are already met them and overlook the characterization in Rosado against Wyman and repeated in Jefferson that it's adventure some for the courts to attempt to alter the State's ability and set a standard of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.648" offset="3385971">I did say also that the Fifth Circuit misinterpreted this Court's decision in Van Lare because Van Lare really had to do with the substantive of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.719" offset="3426200">It didn't really have anything to do with the state's proper calculation of its standard of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.981" offset="3451277">I hasn't add I recognized the last paragraph in Van Lare is there because it jumps out at you and it's quoted in the Fifth Circuit's decision but then I will get to that later.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.574" offset="3493700">I don't think that that's controlling in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.358" offset="3512822">The respondents say that subsection 3 of 1343 is also before the Court which I did not agree but I will have to it after lunch because it will be then and in Gonzales against Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.736" offset="3570291">But they did agree with me that the issue on the merits is whether or not the state complied with the cost of living increase requirement of 602 (a) (23).</text>

            <text syncTime="1083.886" offset="4438915">I won't play for that now but I'll try to show that there's a very real difference between need and income per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.748" offset="4474337">So, let me talk a little bit about establishing the standard of need and refer you to the Ortega Family in this case which is the only of the original plaintiffs it's still in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.796" offset="4522506">The others were recipients of adult assistance program that are no longer in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.825" offset="4542673">In Ortega had four members in the family, two eligible for AFDC, one for Aid to Family and totally disable in one wholly ineligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.514" offset="4581439">For four people if they had all been eligible the shelter allowance would've been $44.00.</text>

            <text syncTime="1165.639" offset="4765968">I submit to the Court that if you don't first assume that proration has no effect and of course we say the Court has never said, We have to do that and you shouldn't not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1203.652" offset="4918000">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.780" offset="4930539">After the consolidation took place in 1973, the Shelter allowances in Texas for one to two persons were $33.00 for three to four persons $44.00 and five or more $50.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.933" offset="4979127">The Ortega household had four persons in it so their proper shelter allowance would be $44.00 if they were all eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.043" offset="5031581">What the state did of course was prorate and come up with a shelter allowance for that household of $33.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.235" offset="5064286">I've already attempt to discuss how that happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.457" offset="5077243">I would like to take just a moment to discuss what the respondent wanted to have happen though.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.496" offset="5101380">There were two grants remember in the household, one for AFDC, one for APTD.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.533" offset="5125517">The respondent's desire as the record reflects I believe at page 221 that that initial $33.00 shelter allowance is being included for the two AFDC recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.450" offset="5173164">And another initial $33.00 shelter allowance be included for the one APTD recipient and of course the fourth person be disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.468" offset="5217259">So, their result would be a $66.00 shelter allowance for this household of three recipients as suppose to the $44.00 which the state would budget and puts figure they don't challenge in this litigation had all four persons it's been eligible and 50% increase over that amount and of course twice what the state maintains the proper amount would be for three individuals $33.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.584" offset="5345677">The Fifth Circuit said that the state's proration policy violated the 1976 federal regulations because proration was a presumption that income was available to the eligible recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.111" offset="5411819">That's incorrect on several basis need as defined in the Social Security Act and by the state is not actual shelter cost in any given case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.890" offset="5454973">The Fifth Circuit also ignored the fact that there was no change in the shelter allowance for any given recipient; it remain in this case at $11.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.298" offset="5500531">It assumed that the state must provide shelter for ineligibles; I've already mentioned I believe that that's an assumption which this Court has never indulged in consciously and which certainly urge not today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.807" offset="5562598">Of course not even the respondents alleged that the state has to assume the burden for providing for the needs of the personal needs of a none recipient if he lives with recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.178" offset="5620067">They don't assume -- they don't assert that the state has to provide medicate benefits for the none recipient and so we urge for the sake of consistency of nothing else that the state not be obligated to provide for the shelter and utilities of that person because they happen to live with the recipient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.842" offset="5686732">We certainly wouldn't have to if they did not live with the recipient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.339" offset="5708779">The Fifth Circuit also of course relies on this Court's decision in Van Lare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.489" offset="5729364">We maintain there are several distinctions between our case and Van Lare and several things that need to be said about Van Lare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.525" offset="5753501">One, the New York policies do mentioned the income and we say did treat the situation in New York as an income question as impose to a needs questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.782" offset="5814523">They used the word in their policies and has to mean something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.794" offset="5830510">Van Lare is remarkable and that it criticizes a states for not prohibiting loggers for being in welfare homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.097" offset="5859767">I say that's remarkable because that was a case where the two of the constitutional claims alleged were privacy and freedom of association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.335" offset="5900727">Van Lare also criticizes a state for taking no further action and that is into allegedly reduce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.072" offset="5923610">I would say not reduce but allegedly reduce the amount for shelter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.312" offset="5940642">The only thing else the state could do is cut off the grant entirely and that would run into King against Smith and any number of your prior decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.623" offset="5973870">The Court said that the only victim is the needy child but I would attempt to demonstrate that the amount of shelter need budget for the needy child is not affected by a proration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.731" offset="6038340">Not even the Fifth Circuit completely ignore the implications of its holding because it did say that when the none recipient owns the home that the proration is permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.939" offset="6095078">How that, is not an assumption of income but the other is has not explained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.522" offset="6113468">That's a distinction, it's not recognized in the 1977 HEW regulations upon which the Solicitor General relies and upon which respondents rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.969" offset="6155264">But the Fifth Circuit's distinction is not challenged here because there's no petition for certiorari from respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.917" offset="6191000">Not incidentally, HEW prior to this time had not found any fault the proration in the record at 245 in the appendix at 40, there's instructions from the Dallas Regional Office to Texas to include prorated figures in the consolidated amounts and that even says in the record at 253 how HEW instructed the states to include its mistakes as well as the correct amounts and not attempt to determine which was which because the object of the fair pricing in consolidation was to come up with the average amounts that the state actually paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.414" offset="6361004">Another way of saying all these is my last argument and that's the state discretion argument 601, 42 U.S.C. 601 clearly allows the states to set their standard of need based on the conditions of each state provide assistance as far as practicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.536" offset="6425475">That's been recognized by this Court as I've said from King against Smith to as recently as Quern against Mandley right at the end of last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.194" offset="6460165">We think that states have legitimate interest in this area such as a head in your decision in Wyman against James and Dublino against New York, Department of Social Services and the goal in this case is not to provide for shelter and utilities for people that are ineligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.701" offset="6526203">We don't do where they -- where ever they live whether it was a recipient or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.061" offset="6547623">The bottom line in the case of course is, is that there's not enough money in Texas to provide for the actual needs of these individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.792" offset="6578552">The respondents sought to attack that by attacking proration but to increase the need standard in Texas by some $9 millions is would be the case if these were done doesn't increase anything except the number of ineligibles getting benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.336" offset="6636753">It doesn't increase the state appropriation only result it would be would have as if the percentage control factor which is now 75% would have to be cut further and the money that would go to the nearly created ineligible recipients would be taken out of the pockets of the people that are admittedly eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.325" offset="6744691">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1666.301" offset="6768619">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.961" offset="6799235">We take issue with petitioner's characterization of the rent range formulas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.614" offset="6829850">He claims that our client was budgeted for $33.00 in that shelter allowance just like she was before her mother and sister moved in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.842" offset="6870706">What he overlooks the facts is that for a household of three and four recipients say would have been budgeted to $44.00 maximum and did received only $33.00 if Sanjuana Ortega who was a public assistance recipient as well as Poller had taken her child had moved in by herself without her mother who was necessary to take care of her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.329" offset="6968717">That household would've been budgeted $44.00 for rent but because the mother came in their household was only budgeted $33.00 and paid 75% of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.481" offset="7013334">We believe this case is controlled by Van Lare versus Hurley, it involves a $9 million substantial question of which at least 65% as federal dollars and we and our brief at page 46 lay out the same budgeting arguments in Van Lare next to the budget arguments in the instant case and you can see that the dollar maximum works almost identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.127" offset="7119914">We would also like to note as to his references regarding HEW's approval came before this Court's decision Van Lare versus Hurley since the Court' decision HEW has codified that regulation, it's in the first two pages of our brief and we believe there's a clear conflict between that HEW codification, this Court's decision in Van Lare v. Hurley and the state welfare regulation on proration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.190" offset="7228165">And I also like to make it clear we're not alleging $66.00 rent allowance for this family.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.094" offset="7247705">We're alleging that they should receive the same rent allowance for any family of three persons or a $44.00 rent allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.268" offset="7300472">There's an other issue regarding whether or not we can raise our arguments for jurisdiction under Section 1343(3) in addition to Section 1343(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.933" offset="7343104">At our brief on page 16, we lay out the cases of this Court that allow us since we're defending a decision below to put forth the arguments which would give us the same relief and that at least as jurisdictional grounds the way we read story parchment, company and Paterson parchment in Lang and United States versus American Railway Express Company are placed in this issues and our position to the petition for certiorari brings them before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.484" offset="7461282">And we would like to begin now our jurisdictional arguments on Section 1343(3) jurisdiction because it's authorize by Section 1983 to its fourth right secured by the constitution v. of the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.970" offset="7527215">There is of course another argument under Section 1343(3) the end laws argument are the coextensive theory this would mean that the rights would come into the end law provisions through Social Security Act of Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.684" offset="7594088">As this Court said in Edelman versus Jordan there's no question that Section 1983 covers Supremacy Clause claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.798" offset="7622614">The questions is whether or not we get jurisdiction under Section 1343.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.448" offset="7649155">We stress 1343 because we believe it's a narrowest argument for this Court as this Court has held in Preicer versus Rodriguez alternative methods for review take Preston over Section 1983 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.885" offset="7710908">We think it's kind of valid that this case does come before this Court in a circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="3534.927" offset="14243088">Back to the Ortega Households for just one second that please remember the groupings of sizes of household one to two people get $33.00 for shelter, three to four people get $44.00 for shelter, five or more get $50.00 for shelter that $11.00 difference between the $33.00 and the $44.00 for the Ortega Household is a result to that grouping of the shelter allowances between the various sizes of household it's not a result of proration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.743" offset="14386343">With regard to the new HEW regulations that purport to codify this Court's decision in Van Lare.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.169" offset="14416018">Of course those were not available or considered at all by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.779" offset="14434513">They were promulgated prior to the Fifth Circuit's decision and the Fifth Circuit had them available at the time of its decision but it did not based its decision on them and did not cite them or make any reference to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.749" offset="14494386">I would also point out that the state's practice in this regard is of long standing, it's not something that post dates Van Lare are those regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.769" offset="14534405">It's not -- wasn't created in perpetuity wherever it comes from it's been around a long, long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.244" offset="14560319">It wasn't created with regard to Van Lare of those regulations at all and that under this Court's recent decision in Quern against Mandley the correct test to see by what standard a state's provision such as it should be tested is the standard that the state says it meets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.484" offset="14641298">Of course in Quern against Mandley it was a switch from emergency assistance to special needs in AFDC but you said the test was, Well, they characterized the special needs, doesn't meet those standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.628" offset="14689886">We characterized it and did long before Van Lare is in needs standard and I suggest the proper question is whether it meets the needs criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.034" offset="14739519">The only limit that I noted in the respondent's brief as to jurisdiction is put in footnote 23 where they say that they recognized limits on jurisdiction when Congress specifically acts to prohibit jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.371" offset="14812871">But I would submit to the Court that that is a backwards argument the federal District Courts unlike the state District Courts in Texas are not courts of general jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.005" offset="14851427">The District -- Federal District Courts are only suppose to have jurisdiction where the Congress grants jurisdiction to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.316" offset="14884655">And it's -- the only broad grant I was ever aware of that was sometimes utilize to take jurisdiction in wide variety of cases was Section 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.173" offset="14932093">I believe it was at the federal administrative procedures act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.275" offset="14944423">That was frequently interpreted where the issue was addressed that to authorize this kind of a test in this Court in Colafado against Sanders said, No, that's not what -- that there is no such independent basis for jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.154" offset="15007953">That was in part based on a statute that Congress had passed just prior to your decision that remove the $10,000.00 limit for jurisdiction against federal officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.034" offset="15047555">Congress is considering such legislation at this time with regard to the states and it's my understanding that the House has passed HR9622 which would remove it as to states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.855" offset="15086843">Of course that action of the House would be a nullity under the respondent's theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.254" offset="15120384">With regard to their reply brief, the real legislative history is what the Congress said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.105" offset="15139819">It's not the memo dredged up somewhere from within the Justice Department and in that respect it's interesting to know that when the Solicitor General filed his amicus brief in this case he said there was no independent federal interest in the resolution of the jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.836" offset="15214738">I find that in every remarkable statement considering when spend a good deal with the morning talking about the constitution laws in 1983 that regardless if it were the Solicitor General's opinion that these provisions referred to all laws surely he would taken the opportunity in his amicus brief to tell us some.</text>

            <text syncTime="3873.318" offset="15596648">Mr. Justice Stevens and Mr. Justice White seem to have some difficulty with an extensive interpretation of the and laws provisions in 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.957" offset="15643251">I submit that that perception is contrary to what Congress is all about when it enacted 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="3893.642" offset="15677942">I submit further that that perception is contrary to the wording of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.716" offset="15702288">Let me go back for a minute if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.993" offset="15711378">In the period 1868 to 1871, federal government was faced with a situation where several state's rights groups contended that not with standing the federal constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.417" offset="15773027">The ultimate legal authority to determine questions of federal law repose in the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.876" offset="15798836">This was at the time when the Freidman's Bureau Act was not being enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.068" offset="15815659">As a result to that situation, President Grant went before the Congress and effectively said, The laws of the federal government are not being enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.584" offset="15857664">Congress has to act pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.882" offset="15870934">In regard to that, Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1871 which is the precursor of 1983 and 1343.</text>
            <text syncTime="3952.456" offset="15913148">It was in point of fact congressional concern about none enforcement of federal rights by the direct interposition of state power that in fact was the focus of the entire juridical mechanism that we now know has 1983 and 1343.</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.507" offset="16001442">Viewed in that light there is not one reason to interpret 1983 in a restrictive manner in truth to narrow why is 1983 the basis and penalizes the entire congressional problem that was addressed in 1871.</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.531" offset="16085452">We must keep in mind here that we are not asking this Court to interpose each judicial power between private parties nor between situations involving simply federal law and none $10,000.00 questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.376" offset="16156923">But we are talking about here is the federalistic and taginism between states and the federal government.</text>

            <text syncTime="4040.130" offset="16263920">I do not believe that is significant for the following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.336" offset="16276668">Number one, in 1871, Congress could only act pursuant to Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.855" offset="16318777">Accordingly, when Congress spoke in 1871 of rights arising under the Constitution, there were clearly referring both to the Constitution itself and to the implementing legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4068.334" offset="16376665">Number two, the Constitution through the Fourteenth Amendment directed to the states of necessity incorporates the privileges immunities of citizens of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="4257.600" offset="17133798">In Swift, you had the following problem as a result of ex parte Young, it was decided that the federal courts could interpose themselves and enjoin actions by state officials.</text>

            <text syncTime="4275.100" offset="17203806">In a sort of compromised situation, there was enacted at three-judge court procedure which was enacted solely to lay the state's fears that a single federal District Court judge would have the power to in a sense interpose himself into the mechanism of state government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4290.978" offset="17267336">Now, during the progeny if you will or the paradigm of that legislation, we find that the Court carved out several exceptions and one of them was where there's a conflict between federal law and state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4304.850" offset="17322820">The Court basically said, This is not so uniquely a state problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4309.033" offset="17339538">That states would be all that concerned about it and would require us in a sense to convene a three-judge court rather this is by its very nature IE by the existence of the federal statute; a federal matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4320.424" offset="17385096">And accordingly the court said, There's probably not the same kind of state concern that would exist if we were dealing solely with an isolated state statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="4904.732" offset="19722324">But I think again the history doesn't support that because the Thirteenth Amendment dealt clearly with racially quality and the Thirteenth Amendment extended to private parties, it didn't even need stay action.</text>

            <text syncTime="4928.800" offset="19818559">But the game changed between 1866 and 1870 with the Fourteenth Amendment and the problem there was that they wanted -- Congress wanted federal rights to be vindicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4939.144" offset="19859937">And what they said was, We'll limit the breadth of our juridical interest by saying it's going to be state action that interferes with you.</text>

            <text syncTime="5588.957" offset="22459225">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5593.209" offset="22476257">I think it might be useful that the outset to note the specific allegations of the complaint which bring these jurisdictional issues before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5604.542" offset="22521501">I note them not because their important to the disposition of the jurisdictional issue are such but because they maybe useful just by way of illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="5615.448" offset="22565177">In brief, the complaint alleges that the petitioner was mugged after cashing her monthly welfare and Social Security checks and that as a result she was unable to pay her rent or her gas and electric bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="5631.920" offset="22631006">The complaint further alleged than rather general terms that as a result of the inability to pay either of these bills that the plaintiff was within approximation of dispositions since she can't pay her rent and imminent danger of having her gas and electricity terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5653.181" offset="22716061">It was further alleged that despite the Solicitor grant the family emergency assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5659.896" offset="22742915">Upon this position having been taken by the local welfare official complaint was filed directly in federal District Court based on these allegations which claim first that the denial violated the provision of federal law same provisions recently interpreted by this Court last June in Quern v. Mandley.</text>
            <text syncTime="5679.378" offset="22820864">And secondly, that this action violated the New Jersey regulations governing an emergency assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5687.751" offset="22854405">The critical part of those state regulations provide that when an actual state of homelessness exist or is manifestly imminent, the county welfare board shall authorize payment of the actual cost of adequate emergency care.</text>
            <text syncTime="5704.595" offset="22921801">I'm not with certainty at least on the face of the complaint that this case fail satisfy the governing state regulations and despite the circumstance, a complaint was filed directly in federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5722.318" offset="22992645">And today, we're confronted with the rather difficult questions concerning the reach of the jurisdictional sections of the 1871 Civil Rights Act in this prospect.</text>

            <text syncTime="5767.876" offset="23174875">And I think that claim is also fabulous at this point knowing the face of the complaint but in light of the affidavit is they were filing a motion for some rejudgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5775.919" offset="23207058">I think it's quite clear at this juncture that there's no substantial pending claim other.</text>
            <text syncTime="5786.381" offset="23248854">Section 1343(3) is the primary jurisdictional section that's relied upon by the petitioner as conferring jurisdiction on the federal District Court over this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5802.386" offset="23312906">This Section has two quite separate basis of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5810.022" offset="23343417">First, is the deprivation of any right privilege or immunity secured by the constitution and the second is the deprivation of any right privilege or immunity secured by any act of Congress providing for equal rights of citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="5830.106" offset="23423770">The petitioner in two disjunctive arguments relies upon both of these subprovisions of 1343(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="5844.059" offset="23479568">The constitutional Supremacy Clause argument relying upon the deprivation of any right privilege immunity secured by the constitution is an effect in argument that every time Congress enacts a new statute it creates a new right privilege or immunity secure against deprivation by state action through the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5873.838" offset="23598686">However, as the Third Circuit properly noted in its opinion when Congress enacts a statute creating rights, it is that statute and not the Supremacy Clause that confers any rights or privileges or immunities that the individual may claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="5896.042" offset="23687502">Now, the Supremacy Clause become relevant if the state through its legislative of actions seeks to take action that will work the operation of that federal legislation that is inconsistent without federal legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5912.898" offset="23755003">Yet, it remains the federal legislation that confers the right that maybe claimed by the particular individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="5920.951" offset="23787186">So, on its face, they secured by the constitution language just as is not applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="5929.773" offset="23822503">Furthermore, if the constitutional portion of 1343(3) were read as broadly as it's urged by the petitioner there will be absolutely no need for the statutory part of the section.</text>
            <text syncTime="5947.801" offset="23894601">District Court jurisdiction would extend to every state action case based on any federal statute and there will be no need for Congress and 3443(3) to have go in ahead and also confer jurisdiction based upon a more limited class of federal statutes providing for equal rights of citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="5971.377" offset="23988851">In other words, the second part of 1343(3) would be surplusage, it would redundancy if the petitioner's Supremacy Clause argument were correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="5996.084" offset="24087698">I think it's appropriate then to turn to the second part of 1343(3) and I think that this also really gets to the 1343(4) argument as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="6008.533" offset="24137540">The critical language of 1343(3) is that there must be an act of Congress providing for equal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6019.070" offset="24179649">Now, we think it's clear that neither the language of this provision providing for equal rights its historical origins in 1871 nor its relationship to other jurisdictional sections including 1331 supports its use in a case claiming solely a violation of the federal Social Security Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="6774.950" offset="27203166">First, there is the point that we've discussed previously that the 1331 leaves open the question of implying that a cause of action from some other federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6789.948" offset="27263143">And in implying the cause of action from some other federal statutes such as the Social Security Act it's possible to imply a right to secure declaratory or injunctive relief and at the same time not to imply a cause of action from money damages such as would be recognized under 1343(3) and 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="6814.896" offset="27362931">Secondly, the law under 1983 has evolved such that there is a very limited room if any for the operation of the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="6835.675" offset="27446105">This Court noted in Gibson v. Berryhill that that issue was not one that's closed that there may still be some circumstances under which exhaustion that administrative of remedies maybe required in 1983 actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6849.974" offset="27503261">But at the present time and as dealt with the lease by many of the lower federal courts that doctrine is practically none existent in an 1983 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6862.549" offset="27553520">What that would mean is a practical matters that if you accept the petitioner's argument -- any welfare case in which the cause of action is pleaded as having been -- is being predicated on federal law could be brought in federal District Court even if ultimately it turns out that the issues are essentially factual and that they are capable of resolution in terms solely of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6893.267" offset="27676400">And I take this case at least on the face of the complaint as an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="6897.728" offset="27694268">It may have turned out at some later stage that significant issues as to conflict between federal and state law Quern v. Mandley emerged.</text>
            <text syncTime="6906.952" offset="27731153">But on the face of the complaint and on the face of the Jersey regulations, this might have been a case where the $163.00 in welfare benefits which was what was an issue could've been resolved very easily within the state welfare administrative mechanism.</text>

            <text syncTime="6941.092" offset="27867721">But it would be a possibility for at least a subportion of that class, I think it's what I'm saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="6949.570" offset="27901680">There ultimately it may have turned out that there were some and in fact we now know that there were some petitioners who would not qualify for benefits under the Jersey regulation that might have qualified for benefits under the federal statute if this Court's decision in Quern v. Mandley had come out the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6975.709" offset="28006170">But as to this particular petitioner and some other part of the subclass then they may have been able to receive their emergency assistance benefits quickly and without regard to the ultimate resolution of that conflict issue in Quern v. Mandley.</text>
            <text syncTime="6991.410" offset="28068968">And my point is that this overly expands of reading of 1983 and 3143(3) urged by the petitioners with its concomitant generally prevailing rule of no requirement of exhaustion of administrator remedies would preclude resort to the simpler and easier means of disposing of many such controversies.</text>
