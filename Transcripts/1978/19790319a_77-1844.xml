            <text syncTime="1844.215" offset="7481219">I would like to begin by responding if I may to some of the questions concerning the commission form of government in Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.639" offset="7514969">Briefly, the history of commission government Mobile as Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out began in 1911.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.479" offset="7542345">The original statute did not require but did authorized the commissioners once they were elected to divide up the executive functions among themselves and it certainly was the practice and custom in Mobile almost from the beginning for the commissioners to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.711" offset="7619250">In fact, it is not a matter of record in this case but there was lawsuit in 1920's by some politicians who were unhappy that commission had adopted that course rather than act in this as a board of directors in common.</text>

            <text syncTime="1896.174" offset="7689049">That's correct and in 1939, pardon my understanding, that the law was explicitly changed to provide for one place to be the mayor in advanced to the election and the two associate commissioners would be assigned to executive functions after the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.119" offset="7772850">That plan also run on some technical problems in the Alabama's state courts and it ended up in 1965 for the first time of the executive functions of the three commissioners were designated by law before they run.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.108" offset="7840872">We would like to point out that the plaintiffs in this case never objected to the retention of the commission form of government which permitted the use of single-member districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.643" offset="7886952">It was a position of the defendant city in this case form the time it filed it's answer through its arguments in the pretrial motions, the pretrial document, pretrial briefs and on into the Court of Appeals that the assignment of executive functions to the three commissioners foreclosed, absolutely foreclosed any remedy in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.974" offset="7988308">That in fact was I think a key stone on their defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.090" offset="8004712">Based on that representations which can also be found by the way in their answer on page 33 of the appendix, that in order for single-member districts to be provided in Mobile, a change in a form of government will have to come about at the court acting in its equitable discussion when it was forced to enter an order of its own, when the City of Mobile and the State of Alabama refused after the Court's invitation to supply some legislative response to the infirmities of the at-large election system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.208" offset="8145251">Then the court, taking the advice of the defendants themselves changed to an optional form of government which is provided in the State of Alabama by other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.535" offset="8198541">State of Alabama has several optional forms of municipal government including the ancient mayor-aldermanic form of government which Mobile was using back in 1900 including a new mayor council, newer mayor council form that was devised specifically for Mobile in 1963 and including a special legislation that governs Montgomery for example and Birmingham which had adopted the so-called strong mayor that everyone in this trial agreed was preferable to the weak mayor where the council could interfere in the day to day business of the executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.897" offset="8359978">But to repeat, it is true that the plaintiffs in the end when asked proposed a remedy suggested a change to a mayor council only because the defendants were urging that any other use of the form government in the context to stay along with districts would be inequitable and inappropriate in Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.891" offset="8435942">The court's remedy list open at the state Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.733" offset="8447331">The option of adopting by legislation, a commission form of government that does permit of the use of single-member districts, that is still open to Alabama if it wishes to use it, but there has been no movement on the part of anyone in the legislature or in city government to seek or to bring about such change.</text>

            <text syncTime="3391.957" offset="13672239">We appear as amicus to urge the court to affirm the judgments below in both numbers 77-1844 and 78-357 which will be argued next.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.982" offset="13732321">Although there are slight differences in the legal analyses which are apparent, I believe, from the briefs we concur fully with the appellees that the maintenance of the at-large voting system for Mobile City Commission and School Commission in all circumstances of these cases violates the Equal Protection Clause and alternatively and independently the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.280" offset="13849558">In the Fourteenth Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause, our analysis like that of the Court of Appeals accepts the fact that Washington versus Davis requires aggrieved parties to make a prima facie showing that the challenged system is purposefully discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.890" offset="13935971">Our submission is that the exhaustive records in these cases demonstrates such purposeful discrimination that the careful factual findings made by the District Court and thoroughly reviewed by the Court of Appeals should be given great difference and that the at-large election system cannot be sustained in the circumstances because it impairs if not submerges meaningful access to the political process on the basis of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.311" offset="14081630">The starting point of our analysis is White versus Regester and its antecedents Whitcomb versus Chavis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.478" offset="14114335">Our reading of White is that the ultimate inquiry is whether black citizens of Mobile City and County had been excluded from meaningful access to the political process because of their ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.619" offset="14182881">In White versus Regester with all the Justices joining us to this point, the Court reiterated several factors alluded to in Whitcomb and in judging whether the at-large scheme at issue has been purposefully operated and maintained.</text>

            <text syncTime="4593.688" offset="18479188">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice I wasn't sure that I had any minutes left but let me answer one question for Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.455" offset="18510221">According to the Municipal Year Book and I guess it's fairly accurate 67% of all the cities are -- have elections apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="4615.009" offset="18564451">Now, the Government here and its brief, says the measure of the effect of an electoral system is not proportional representation but fair representation and I say to this Court that as they review the record in this case, they're going to find that blacks have been fairly represented in Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="4652.489" offset="18714394">We quote on pages 10, and I guess 9 and 20, Reverend Hope who had some Non-Partisan Voters League and he says that the current commissioners fairly represent the blacks in Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="4673.480" offset="18798299">And for 16 years, there was a commissioner, Mr. Langan who was noted for the fact that he represented the blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4686.414" offset="18850022">So I don't think that the blacks were indeed their support the kiss of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.353" offset="18877816">He was there an awful long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4695.612" offset="18886802">Now in conclusion, I believe very strongly in the right to vote, on an equal vote and I believe that that's what Mobile provides here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4707.139" offset="18932987">It provides equal access to the voting system, equal participation in that system and an equal count of those votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4718.736" offset="18979380">I think that's all the Constitution requires and polarization is the only thing that they've offered here to prove invidious discrimination, and I don't think that's enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="4772.335" offset="19193689">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4775.769" offset="19207481">My part of these proceedings concerns the constitutionality of the way Mobile County's School Commissioners are elected and since no later than 1836, these commissioners, the members of the Mobile County School Board, if you will, had been elected by the voters of the county at-large.</text>
            <text syncTime="4802.691" offset="19315210">There were so elected when this action was brought by black residents of the county complaining that this at-large electoral system unconstitutionally diluted their voting power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4819.097" offset="19380830">As you have heard, blacks make up about a third of the population of Mobile County slightly greater proportion of the population the city itself that is around the third the entire county.</text>
            <text syncTime="4836.636" offset="19450943">The District Court sustained the plaintiffs' complaint and the Court of Appeals summarily affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4843.983" offset="19480304">The issue that is posed by that decision is whether an at-large method of election in a school district that has a significant black minority is unconstitutional merely because there is racially polarized voting and black minority candidates have not been elected to the Board however deeply rooted the at- large method of election may be in history and non-racial policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4884.895" offset="19643935">I hope in describing the proceedings and the decisions below to demonstrate that the case poses the issue just that boldly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4895.980" offset="19688344">Then I will try to explain why the resolution of that issue by the district and the court of appeals is inconsistent with Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and with this Court's decisions construing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4914.293" offset="19761591">But first, the facts and how they give rise to the issue I've stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4921.335" offset="19789699">The longstanding commitment of Alabama to the at-large election of the members of the governing body of the Mobile County Schools is undoubted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4932.403" offset="19834002">The Pub -- the Mobile Public School system was established in 1826, 28 years before a statewide system of schools and public school was established in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="4945.401" offset="19886038">Either that original enabling Act in 1826 that seems to be ambiguous or if not that then a replacement stature, there was an Act in 1836, established a system of at-large election that has prevailed continuously since.</text>
            <text syncTime="4964.785" offset="19963570">As Your Honors, had may have learned from the perusal of the briefs, the statute that provided for single-member districts was an enacted in 1975 but was voided because of a technical defect in the giving of notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4982.157" offset="20033055">The original provision for the at-large election of Mobile County School Commissioners in the early 1800's and the enactment in 1919 of the at-large election legislation that governs today were not motivated by any consideration of the impact that at-large voting might have on black residents.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="5009.572" offset="20142665">I suppose that the time of, that would be 1836 or later, only white people voted, only white people were elected to the school board, and only white students went to the schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="5022.131" offset="20192925">And no one thought of the possibility that blacks might vote at that time in 1836.</text>
            <text syncTime="5028.982" offset="20220301">In 1919, when the present enabling statue was enacted, blacks have been effectively disenfranchised in Alabama by the Constitution of 1901, a situation that prevailed until about the time of the Second World War and shortly thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5047.860" offset="20295847">Now, there's another key fact that appears from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5052.894" offset="20316014">Notwithstanding, the history of which we're all aware and to which government counsel referred, of racial discrimination in many, many aspects of the life of Alabama, there are today no formal or informal barriers to full participation by black residents in the political process in Mobile County including in particular school board elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="5081.924" offset="20432102">Blacks are able freely to register and to vote, they participate in both parties in the partisan process that leads to the election of school board members.</text>
            <text syncTime="5093.808" offset="20479645">Any candidate who's interested in running for the school board may do so, and it doesn't cost much to run for the school board.</text>

            <text syncTime="5309.256" offset="21341372">Now as I've indicated, what I've recited heretofore are findings that made by Judge Pittman and accepted by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5318.760" offset="21379406">Judge Pittman also found that there was racially polarized voting in Mobile County and he said further that this tendency to vote according to race made it difficult for a black person, a member of this minority to be elected to the school board in at-large election.</text>
            <text syncTime="5342.799" offset="21475641">In fact, four black candidates run for the school board between 1962 and 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="5352.600" offset="21514825">Each of them was running for office for the first time, each of them reached the run-off, none was elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="5362.286" offset="21553591">Judge Pittman looked at these facts in the course of an analysis of the case that he felt himself compelled to follow because of the Court of Appeal's decisions in Zimmer against McKeithen and other cases that have followed Zimmer which have made the Zimmer factors decisive in Fifth Circuit voting delusion cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5390.506" offset="21666440">You can't really understand what happened below not knowing something about these Zimmer factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5397.948" offset="21696219">And the first Zimmer factor that Judge Pittman analyzed relates to minority access to the slating or candidate selection process.</text>
            <text syncTime="5409.310" offset="21741672">He made a finding, nominally a finding that blacks were denied equal access to the slating or candidate selection process I quote in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5421.700" offset="21791201">But this finding was obviously a mere function of his view that potential black candidates were discouraged from running because of the history of losing elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="5436.512" offset="21850446">And the candidates lost those elections because they were members of a racial minority in a community in which there was racially polarized voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="5446.421" offset="21890048">I submit that in truth that it is to saying nothing more than that racially polarized voting has prevailed in Mobile County.</text>

            <text syncTime="5988.762" offset="24059465">Judge Pittman professed not to endorse quota voting or quota elections but he adopted a plan that was designed, these are his words.</text>
            <text syncTime="5998.895" offset="24100007">To provide blacks a realistic opportunity to elect blacks to the Board of school commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="6006.212" offset="24129264">In fact, two of the five single member districts that he created would have weighted -- would have weighted black populations of more than 55% and the remaining three districts would have weighted black populations of less then 14%.</text>
            <text syncTime="6026.305" offset="24209617">The Court of Appeals affirmed this decision according to the Zimmer factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="6032.696" offset="24235217">It said that the District Court that applied the proper standards and that he's findings were not clearly erroneous and decided just one case the decision of a different panel on the Court of Appeals in the City of Mobile's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6047.450" offset="24294149">Now a good deal of argument has gone on about exactly what the Court of Appeals thereby decided and whether in particular the Court of Appeals decided and whether it is necessary to make out a violation of the Equal Protection Clause and of the Fifteenth Amendment to show purposeful discrimination on the part of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="6080.044" offset="24424552">The correctness of that view which I think clearly is correct that purposefulness is required is contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="6094.609" offset="24482858">So let me turn first by way of analysis of that to a couple of points that I think cannot be contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="6102.580" offset="24514727">One is that no one has asserted or even suggested that the at-large system here was conceived in racial animus with a deliberate purpose of discriminating against blacks or submerging the votes of blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="6122.426" offset="24594139">The second is that the District Court made its decision on the basis of an understanding that the Court of Appeals as Zimmer factors captured the effects of an at-large system on minority voters and candidates not on the understanding that those factors go to an intent to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6148.380" offset="24697898">At that point we get into more contentious ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="6152.128" offset="24712944">At one point in his opinion, Mr. Justice Rehnquist referred to the parallel point in this opinion in the City of Mobile's case, at one point in his opinion removed from his Zimmer analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6168.945" offset="24780131">Judge Pitts -- Judge Pittman said that it was possible to perceive a present purpose to dilute black votes based on legislative in action, based on the failure of the legislature to do anything about this at-large system that had been created so many years before.</text>
            <text syncTime="6191.410" offset="24869992">I can think that the person reading that passage, it's at page 34 (a) of the appendix in our case, will agree that this is no finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6203.523" offset="24918476">No finding of a present purpose to discriminate even though that's how the plaintiffs now like to describe it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6209.570" offset="24942717">It's in a Section titled “Conclusions of law.”</text>

            <text syncTime="6586.287" offset="26449565">First, there is a statutory claim in this case is which has the Chief Justice noted in the last argument ordinarily as a claim to this result prior to decision in any constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="6597.035" offset="26492510">We alleged that under Section 2 or the Voting Rights Act, the at-large election is using these cases violates Section 2 and we rely in particular on statement by Attorney General Katzenbach which is quoted by this Court in footnote 31 in Allen which says that Section 2 covers purpose or effect that it has, I would paraphrase that, the same meaning of Section 5 does but with a different burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="6624.454" offset="26602224">Second, there is a constitutional claim under White against Regester.</text>
            <text syncTime="6630.025" offset="26624481">Now, with regard to that, we are in agreement with the government that we seek only to apply decisions of this Court in White and before and after it which I think it fairly well-established.</text>
            <text syncTime="6640.134" offset="26664918">We are in disagreement with the Government which reads some intent requirement in to White.</text>
            <text syncTime="6644.474" offset="26682264">We see no intent requirement in White and we've set out at length in our brief why.</text>

            <text syncTime="7736.060" offset="31048683">It is our contention that they are indeed enough and they are enough under White against Regester, under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and of the Fifteenth Amendment although for somewhat different reasons because the rational of each of those rules is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="7749.277" offset="31101555">With regard to that I think perhaps I should answer a question that Mr. Justice Rehnquist asked earlier about Zimmer versus McKeithen.</text>
            <text syncTime="7758.860" offset="31139798">The -- both parties in Court of Appeals relied on Zimmer against McKeithen and you will find in the brief for the school board, the statement which says they think Zimmer against McKeithen is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="7768.384" offset="31177937">I think we were all obligated to operate in the context of Zimmer in the Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="7773.445" offset="31198208">I think here, it is indeed argue that Zimmer was too constricted in its application of White against Regester and that that left proof is required and is elaborated in Zimmer and we also have disagreement with the part of Nevett against Sides which is of course subsequent, which holds that intent is in fact necessary under White or Zimmer.</text>
            <text syncTime="7796.901" offset="31292040">We say there's a reason for that contention in our brief at length.</text>
            <text syncTime="7804.721" offset="31323282">Your Honor, I'd like to touch very briefly on our claim under the Voting Rights Act which we think is the issue which the Court ought to begin.</text>
            <text syncTime="7816.177" offset="31369153">We -- we've -- we've noted that the legislative history on this matter as such as this quite clear that Attorney General Katzenbach testified on the very issue of whether or not the statute covered purpose and effect and it said that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="7828.991" offset="31420353">We think if we're at the substantive standard under the Voting Rights Act under Section 2 is exactly the same as the substantive standard under Section 5 which is to say that if the election law permits white voters to nullify the electoral preferences of blacks that it falls under the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="7846.052" offset="31488585">The difference -- the only difference that we see between Section 5 and Section 2 is a procedural one.</text>
            <text syncTime="7850.830" offset="31507707">That the burden of proof is on the state under Section 5, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff under Section 2.</text>
