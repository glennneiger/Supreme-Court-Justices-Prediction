            <text syncTime="2056.232" offset="8328338">The New York statutory scheme does not discriminate against illegitimates inheriting either from their mother or father.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.763" offset="8362402">It merely provides in the case where an illegitimates is claiming through his father that there be an order of a New York Court determining parentage made during the lifetime of the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.295" offset="8412557">While the statute does refer to a two-year requirement, the New York courts have not enforced that two-year requirement and as you will find in the brief filed by the Attorney General, there are decisions which indicate that is not the law of New York at the present time, although there has not been a determination on that, but the New York Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2109.864" offset="8542856">They have treated it for various reasons constitutional and otherwise as just being an unwise legislative discribment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.425" offset="8581099">But other than that, the requirement that the order be obtained during the lifetime of the father, I think is a reasonable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.447" offset="8617148">I think we're here not to consider the peculiar equities of this particular case and there maybe equities on the appellant side, I don't argue that there are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.806" offset="8658631">What we're here to evaluate is the New York statutory scheme and whether the legislature of the State of New York in protecting its citizens and in passing laws with regard to decedent's distribution, could require as a requirement in the case of illegitimates inheriting from their father that there be a Court order during the lifetime of the father in order to prevent fraud, in order to prevent a situation where New York estates would not be closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.853" offset="8786735">Obviously, situations could arise where illegitimates are not known off and they could make claims later on, and it would destroy the sanctity of decrees which determine distribution in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.612" offset="8845772">And I think for that reason, the legislature as indicated by the report of the Bennett Commission was justified in making this requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.784" offset="8882552">I think, the requirement is a reasonable one and I think, that is the only test.</text>

            <text syncTime="2227.038" offset="9011493">So, I can understand why the New York Courts have gone out of their way to exercise the two-year provision, but I also understand why it's there and I think it's a functional purpose.</text>
