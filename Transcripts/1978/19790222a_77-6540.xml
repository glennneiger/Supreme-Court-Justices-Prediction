            <text syncTime="10.430" offset="145115">And here first the case 77-6540 Harold Ramsey versus New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.116" offset="255875">Mr. Fisher, you may proceed when you are ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="steven_fisher" startTime="42.161" stopTime="268.432">
            <label>Mr. Steven Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="42.161" offset="271966">Chief Justice Brennan and May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.659" offset="285968">This case involves the practice of plea bargaining and the voluntariness of a guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.352" offset="312822">Its distinguishing feature is that it presents for review, the issue of whether and to what extent; a sitting trial justice may participate in the actual give and take of negotiations for a guilty plea and it invites the resolution of a question specifically left open in Brady against United States of what the consequences would be if a judge were to deliberately employ his sentencing power to induce a defendant to tender a guilty plea by threatening to impose a harsh sentence after trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.368" offset="476871">Harold Ramsey, the petitioner was 24 years old when he took this plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.868" offset="494843">He had a history of emotional problems and was certainly no stranger to the criminal justice system in Kings County.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.959" offset="523160">He had been a juvenile delinquent; he had been adjudicated a youthful offender and had been convicted of a felony prior to this involvement with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.557" offset="561612">In this case, he was charged with two separate armed robberies.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.387" offset="580942">And as his case made its way to the Courts of King’s County, he appeared in a conference part, which was specially designated in King's County for the exploration with the possibility of disposition without trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.158" offset="639979">In that part, he entered a guilty plea to the reduced charge of unarmed robbery and did so upon a sentencing promise made by the judge of an indeterminate term from three and a half to seven years incarceration that being only slightly greater than the very minimum he could have received under New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.936" offset="727124">Subsequently, he was through that plea and the case was transferred to a trial part where Mr. Ramsey for the first time encountered the judge whose conduct is called into question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.199" offset="784175">It was 18 months after he had been arrested and he had been incarcerated throughout that period of time when Mr. Ramsey was afforded a pre-trial Wade hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.377" offset="840913">One witness was called, she identified the petitioner as the perpetrator of the armed robbery quite definitely and the defense tried to raise some issue as to the propriety of a pre-trial identification techniques.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.703" offset="906219">However, the next day, the next morning, prior to the conclusion of that hearing, the defendant Mr. Ramsey offered to plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.386" offset="952926">This time to the charge of armed robbery has charged in the indictment, one count to cover both indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.914" offset="983019">This plea upon a sentencing promise offered by the judge of an indeterminate term now from six to twelve years incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.895" offset="1026905">There is no transcript of the negotiations that led to this guilty plea, because as is the custom in King's County and in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.049" offset="1075597">Plea negotiations are generally conducted at bench conferences and are not recorded, they are not on the record, but we learn about the negotiations and what happened to lead the petitioner to plead guilty, because immediately prior to sentence, the petitioner moved on paper supported by his own affidavit and the affidavit of Defense Counsel.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="268.432" offset="1177057">Mr. Fisher, before you continue you had told us just a moment ago that ordinarily in King's County plea negotiations are conducted at bench conferences of which no record is made.</text>

            <text syncTime="280.597" offset="1225749">Does that apply that it's quite usual for judges to participate in the negotiations?</text>

            <text syncTime="289.090" offset="1259708">In fact, at oral argument in the appellate division below, the district attorney quite candidly conceded that this type of negotiations goes on all the time.</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="304.335" offset="1320730">Well, I would ask that the Court establish a procedural safeguard based upon my analysis of Jackson, the needless encouragement of guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.597" offset="1365765">I would think that the active participation of a trial judge in the give and take of negotiations for a guilty plea encourages a defendant to plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.185" offset="1408084">And it serves no State interest therefore it is needless.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="328.937" offset="1419160">Well, to what extent would you suggest the judge has any role in the file?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_fisher" startTime="332.636" stopTime="351.901">
            <label>Mr. Steven Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="332.636" offset="1433893">Well, I think that an agreement maybe reached between the Defense Counsel and the Prosecutor, and that agreement maybe presented to the trail judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.240" offset="1480286">Now, my argument is limited essentially to judges who are scheduled to preside at trail in the event that no disposition is reached.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="351.901" stopTime="356.694">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="351.901" offset="1511006">A judge here will sentence the man if he pleads not guilty, but is found guilty.</text>

          <turn speaker="steven_fisher" startTime="356.694" stopTime="401.111">
            <label>Mr. Steven Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="356.694" offset="1530128">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.361" offset="1536815">I find no constitutional objection to the conference part concept that is established in King's County where a defendant who may invite judicial participation can do so knowing that the judge with whom he is negotiating will not preside at a trail should no disposition be reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.698" offset="1630124">It seems to me that the source of the encouragement to plead guilty is the defendant's knowledge that a rejection of a plea offer made by the Court, by the judge will mean a trial held before the same judge who may view him then as a guilty man who has rejected a fair disposition of this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="401.111" stopTime="424.989">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="401.111" offset="1707865">What if the prosecutor offers to recommend a certain sentence to the defendant if he pleads guilty and the defendants says, how do I know what the judge will do?</text>
            <text syncTime="411.810" offset="1750601">Your recommendation isn't binding and the prosecutor says, well, if you are agreeable, we can take it to the judge and we make it some feel for how he thinks about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.618" offset="1793860">Would you say that's unconstitutional?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_fisher" startTime="424.989" stopTime="464.770">
            <label>Mr. Steven Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="424.989" offset="1803368">I would not object to the presentation as in the federal system of an agreement being presented to a judge who then may ratify or reject the offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.238" offset="1864286">The judge must act independently in accordance with his own responsibility and certainly, his responsibility is to ultimately impose sentence, so that an independent agreement reached by the prosecutor and Defense Counsel cannot bind the judge and they may present that I find nothing, I do not find the same course of impact in that presentation to a judge.</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="465.839" offset="1966686">Well, the first difference that comes to mind is although, assume that, that agreement was rejected by the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.409" offset="2012975">There would be no personal investment in the plea bargaining procedure by the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.711" offset="2038262">There would be no personal rejection as in the case where a judge himself makes a specific plea offer and the defendant rejects it.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.696" offset="2078177">The judge apparently or presumably would make an offer that he would plea fair to all sides and by the defendant rejecting the offer made by the Court, he would then face the possibility that the judge would resent that reject, and that his resentment might either intentionally or subconsciously work its way either into a sentencing function or into the discretionary ruling that he would make a trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="584.103" offset="2439816">In this case, this is a good example of where the prosecutor is taken out of the plea negotiating procedure, because all the prosecutor did here was prior to the Wade hearing, he said that, he would consent to a reduction in charge, he would consent to a guilty plea to unarmed robbery; his consent being needed under statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2084.284" offset="8440560">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.476" offset="8453308">Before I respond to petitioner's arguments with regard to the constitutional propriety of judicial participation plea negotiations, I would like to clear up what I perceive to have been a misconception not a misrepresentation but a misconception of what the conference part in Kings County is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.821" offset="8526660">Conference part is not statutorily mandated there is no provision it for anywhere in the New York Criminal Procedure Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.536" offset="8553514">However the court rules enacted by the various appellate divisions of the state of New York have established a separate and distinct conference part whereby after a defendant has been indicted, his case will be sent to the conference part for discussion concerning the disposition before plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.425" offset="8633031">Present at this discussion are defense counsel, the prosecutor, not necessarily the defendant he may waive his presence and the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.515" offset="8673468">At that time, the prosecutor presents the information he has with regard to the case; defense attorney responds with regard to defenses or any other matter that he'd like to bring before the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.185" offset="8720071">At that time, the judge after evaluating the entire record by reading the grand jury minutes, listening to both sides advises the defense attorney of what he would consider to be a favorable or permissible disposition in this case, is not as, as counsel has pointed out most of these negotiations, in fact all of these negotiations do not appear on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.052" offset="8811604">But this is not necessarily a detriment to the plea bargaining system in Kings County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.548" offset="8837517">Because if there is any question certainly defense counsel and the court may go on the record and spread out, as in this case, their understanding of what the plea agreement was all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.915" offset="8887045">I have suggested in my brief that due process would be satisfied if a trail judge participated if at the -- well during the negotiations everything is spread out on the record, but that does not necessarily preclude or require for that matter that the negotiations be taken down step-by-step.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.585" offset="8961755">I see nothing constitutionally wrong with the situation in which at the conclusion of the discussions, the prosecutor, defense counsel, and the judge spell out the agreement and the terms of the agreement as they understood them to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.876" offset="9018911">Certainly under those circumstances, particularly where a defense counsel may be looking towards a claim of prejudicial conduct or coercion would be expected to indicate what he believed to be the coercive aspects of this plea negotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.328" offset="9084635">Secondly I would like to point out that it was raised during oral argument, during petitioner's argument that suppression hearing is markedly different because the suppression motion must be addressed to a particular judge therefore establishing the strict necessity which he perceives under United States versus Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.293" offset="9164570">But the easy answer to that is that in addition to all of the prejudicial information which is brought out at this suppression hearing, at which time the judge may suppress evidence which conclusively establishes the guilt of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.524" offset="9221517">You may also have the suppression part or the counterpart of a plea part that we have in Kings County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.192" offset="9256103">What he seems to be saying is then, that you have to have the suppression motion directed to the particular judge because the motion must be made to the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.291" offset="9292570">But on the other hand a court can just as easily set up a suppression part where a trial judge, or a suppression judge hears all suppression motions and then after the disposition is reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.558" offset="9329560">The case may be sent back to the trail judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.678" offset="9346069">With regard to the American Bar Association Standards, I think it's interesting to note that not only do they recommend an increased participation of the trial judge or for that matter any judge in which the judge may suggest to the defendant completely unsolicited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.661" offset="9413987">What he would consider to be a favorable disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.152" offset="9431960">But in addition to that, the American Bar Association specifically rejected a proposal which would require the disqualification of the judge on motion of the defendant but as a predicate for that motion, it must be established that the judge had been exposed to prejudicial information in the presentence report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.318" offset="9516596">Even the American Bar Association which in 1968 recommended no judicial participation of plea negotiations has now said a judge may only be disqualified if exposed to an unfavorable presentence report.</text>
