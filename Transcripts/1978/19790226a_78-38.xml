            <label>Mr. Laurence J. Cohen</label>
            <text syncTime="75.604" offset="405817">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.344" offset="420760">This is an action for breach of the duty of fair representation under the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.383" offset="444897">In the district court, the jury found that the union had breached its duty to Mr. Foust.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.384" offset="468929">It awarded compensatory damages of $40,000 and punitive damages of $75,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.523" offset="501426">The Tenth Circuit affirmed in all respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.701" offset="514173">This Court denied certiorari on two of the issues raised in our petition whether the union had breached its duty as a matter of law and whether the award of compensatory damages was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.383" offset="568926">The single issue on which certiorari was granted, was the propriety of the punitive damage award.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.840" offset="606751">The basis for the lower court's finding that the union had breached its duty to Foust was the fact that it filed a grievance on his behalf, two days after the expiration of the 60-day grievance period provided in the collective bargaining agreement and that was the basis of the ultimate denial of that grievance by the National Railroad Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.632" offset="709883">The facts underlying the filing of the grievance are basically undisputed and can be summarized briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.093" offset="743737">Foust was an employee of the Union Pacific Railroad and he was represented by the IBEW for collective bargaining purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.097" offset="775711">In March of 1970, he was injured on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.645" offset="789922">He took several succeeding medical leaves of absence, the last of which expired December 22, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.427" offset="825031">He did not file a timely request for a further extension of his leave of absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.326" offset="852720">And on February 3, 1971, The Railroad wrote to Foust and stated that he was discharged for his failure to do so and his failure to submit a required physician statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.198" offset="908204">Now under this Court's decision in Elgin, Joliet &amp; Eastern Railway against Burley, Foust at that point had the option of proceeding on his own to file a grievance or asking that it be handled by his union or by an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.254" offset="968391">He chose to use the attorney, who was then representing him in his personal injury claim under the Federal Employers Liability Act and on February 11, his attorney wrote to the Railroad concerning the discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.824" offset="1026696">The letter went unanswered and he got no favorable response in two subsequent phone calls to The Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.303" offset="1060551">On March 26, which was the 51st day of the grievance period, the attorney wrote to the union, the union representative Jones, and asked that the union attempt to have Jones, excuse me, Foust reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.177" offset="1120110">Jones considered the request unusual, since it came not from the employee the union represented but from his attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.822" offset="1146650">So he called his superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.332" offset="1156681">They discussed the matter and concluded they needed an authorization from Foust himself to proceed, and the superior prepared a letter for Jones to send to Foust.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.184" offset="1208090">He mailed that letter to Jones, who dated and signed it and he mailed it to Foust on April the 5th.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.079" offset="1239646">In essence, the letter said we need a written authorization from you to handle this matter on your behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.852" offset="1266813">He didn't wait for a response.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.182" offset="1272142">However, on the following day, April 6, he filed a grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.752" offset="1290428">That however was two days after the 60-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.564" offset="1313625">I would like to mention two other factual points.</text>

            <text syncTime="308.958" offset="1339225">It's not entirely clear, Mr. Justice Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.560" offset="1353644">In his deposition, he said I feel at that time that it was untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.195" offset="1380185">We don't deny that he should have known it was untimely.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.853" offset="1394813">Well, it would have been horrible if he knew it was untimely, and then wrote a letter like that.</text>

            <text syncTime="327.154" offset="1411950">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.999" offset="1415398">It's my understanding of the record that he – that it's simply not clear that he did know it at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.686" offset="1442147">Foust admitted that he made no effort between February 3rd, the date of his discharge and April 5th to contact the union personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.173" offset="1476106">He also acknowledged that there was no animosity, or adverse, or bad relationship between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.709" offset="1502229">His only complaint was that the union was late in filing his grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.100" offset="1523754">Now our principal position here is that punitive damages are not a proper remedy for breach of the duty of fair representation and that is because a duty of fair representation suit is one to enforce a statutory right and the remedy for violation of that right must also be drawn from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.417" offset="1612988">Specifically, the question of whether punitive damages are allowable in a fair representation case, we feel must be determined by the National Labor Policy, the best evidence of which is found under the National Labor Relations Act under which there are many more precedents than the Railway Labor Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence J. Cohen</label>
            <text syncTime="532.787" offset="2234493">That is our principal position just as in a 303 action, which is also an action for a statutory tort, no matter how willful or even vicious, as this Court held in Teamsters v. Morton only remedial sanctions are provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.212" offset="2296247">Of course, we do make the alternative argument, Mr. Justice Rehnquist that on the record of this case, if the Court does not accept our principal position, the standard used by the Tenth Circuit is far lacking the requirements of the prevailing standard for punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.433" offset="2377122">We submit that the -- on the principal position that the Federal Labor Policy, which underlies these statutes is one of providing exclusively remedial relief under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.324" offset="2432711">This was established as early as the Republic Steel case we cite, where Chief Justice Hughes noted that the Act contained only remedial and not punitive relief, and he noted that the deterrent effect of punitive action was not a sufficient justification for such sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.455" offset="2513168">Those principles have been reiterated trough the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.486" offset="2525288">In this Court for example in the Carpenters Local 60 case by you Mr. Chief Justice, when writing for the DC Circuit in the Ladies Garment Worker's case we cite at page 15, the same result obtains under the Forty-Seventh Amendment, the LMRA, I just mentioned Teamsters versus Morton which is an explicit holding, also under 301 a breach of contract action where the leading case is the Brooke Shoe decision which we cite where Chief Judge Biggs I think succinctly summed up both the correct result and the reason for that result, “It is a general policy of The Federal Labor Laws to which the Federal Courts are to look for guidance in Section 301 actions, to supply remedies rather then punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.284" offset="2740537">”Now it appears to us that this Court reached the same conclusion in this very context in Vaca versus Sipes.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.355" offset="2768750">After noting that the jury there had awarded both compensatory and punitive damages, the Court held “Such damages are not recoverable from the union in the circumstances of this case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="681.992" offset="2831339">The Court then went on to discuss the fact that any compensatory damages that were due if the union had breached its duty, would have been attributable to the wrongful discharge by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.887" offset="2886928">Now the Ninth Circuit has interpreted Vaca as we do as holding the punitive damages are strictly unavailable in fair representation cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="783.304" offset="3236551">As far as the Railway Labor Act itself, probably the most thorough analysis of its structure was provided by the Third Circuit in the Deboles case which we cite at pages 12, 13 and 24 and 25 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.260" offset="3308440">In which after examining the precedents under the National Labor Relations Act and the structure of the Railway Labor Act, the Court concluded “There is no intention that the Railway Labor Act deviates from this general pattern of remedies under the NLRA, at least with respect to union misconduct.”</text>
            <text syncTime="822.651" offset="3394017">The same conclusion had been reached in another Railway Labor Act case many years earlier in Judge Taylor Bright's opinion in Brady versus TWA.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.938" offset="3439156">Now we think it's significant in looking at the Railway Labor Act, that under the provisions of Section 2 (Tenth) the criminal sanctions which are provided for willful carrier violations of five specified paragraphs, do not encompass the duties which are declared in paragraphs First and Second from which this Court has said the duty of fair representation arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.358" offset="3548766">So we feel if the test is the National Labor Policy that the conclusion must be reached that punitive damages are not allowable for any breach of the duty of fair representation or wrongful discharge.</text>

            <text syncTime="917.405" offset="3773001">Well we think again though Mr. Justice Rehnquist that you have to look to the scheme of the statues and even when Congress amended the Act in 1947 to provide Union Unfair Labor Practices it made no change in its for remedial policy and this Court's decision in Carpenters Local 60 in 1961 was a case where a remedy which this Court held punitive was imposed on a union based on its action vis-à-vis the employees it represented and this Court held the Douze Reimbursement Remedy in that case was punitive and could not stand.</text>

            <text syncTime="1015.371" offset="4164838">We think, the same approach or the same result obtains under a different approach, a more general statutory approach which we suggest, in which we draw from Judge Parker's decision for the Fourth Circuit in Mine Workers versus Patton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.124" offset="4231920">We cite that at some detail in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.623" offset="4249893">We also in our reply brief cite the Phelps Dodge case, where this Court held that even in the flagrant case of a deliberately discriminatory refusal to hire based on union membership, a violation that is both willful and one that runs to the heart of the Act, no more than a make hold order was appropriate and we think under either the specific or the more general standard that we advance the conclusion should be reached that neither employers nor unions in these wrongful discharge duty of fair representation cases should be subject to the threat of punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.831" offset="4414673">If the Court does not accept that basic position, that punitive damages are never available in fair representation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.429" offset="4457096">We think that the filing of Foust grievance two days out of time is not a legally sufficient basis to support the award in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.165" offset="4500041">That is because the prevailing requirement as we understand it for an award of punitive damages is some showing of malice or willful or outrageous misconduct as opposed to a showing of negligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1178.503" offset="4817377">We have set forth a number of cases including this Court's decision only last term in Carey versus Piphus which seems to require as we suggest a showing of some sort of malicious intention or deliberate violence or oppression, I won't go into all of those here, they are set out in our brief, as it is Dean Prosser's work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.406" offset="4916955">In fact the court below seemed to be aware that it was using a lesser standard than some of the other Courts including those on which it had purported to rely, but it didn't explain why its lesser standard might be correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.997" offset="4979336">Now when it looked at the facts here, the Tenth Circuit noted “The time available to the union was limited.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.141" offset="5015907">And it was limited because Foust's prior attorney used up 52 of the 60 days available, but the Court nevertheless faulted the union for engaging in what it called ‘Needless correspondence back and forth' during the remaining eight days and for insisting on an authorization from Foust. So at most and in the Tenth Circuit's own view, the union was guilty of negligence or an error of law or of judgment, which does not even approach the kind of malicious or willful misconduct, which is required to support the punitive damage award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.406" offset="5172955">I would like to add a final word in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.806" offset="5186644">This Court's last statement on the duty of fair representation was in Hines versus Anchor Motor Freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.200" offset="5216214">And one of the points made there was that a mere error of judgment was not sufficient to find a breach of the duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.156" offset="5251950">Well, we may not argue that here, but I would submit that if it is not adequate to find a breach of the duty and that is in essence what happened here, it a fortiori is not sufficient to support an award of punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.140" offset="5323943">On either of the basis therefore, we think the judgment of awarding punitive damages should be reversed and unless the Court has further questions, I'll save my remaining time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1327.796" offset="5414536">The beginning point of the argument was Vaca versus Sipes statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.040" offset="5443584">We hold that such damages are not recoverable from the union in the circumstances of this case. That case in the next paragraph goes on to say, “the appropriate remedy for a breach of a union's duty of fair representation must vary with the circumstances of the particular breach.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.486" offset="5525295">We rely in our brief on Textile Workers versus Lincoln Mills, a case decided in 1957 and in that case, they went into the statutory history of the Labor Management Relations Act and admittedly those – the acts here –- the Railway Labor Act and the LMRA are very similar in their approaches to the solving of union problems, but Lincoln Mills like Vaca leaves it almost to an ad hoc approach to each case for the district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.572" offset="5677641">There is no guidance, one suspects in later cases unless you can take such cases as Harrison versus the United Transportation Union, a case in which Certiorari was denied in 1976 in this Court, in which it was stated by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals that unless punitive damages are available, an employee may lack the strong legal remedy necessary to protect his rights against a union, which is either maliciously or in utter disregard of his rights denied him fair representation, to say then that this Court when it denied Cert did not have that issue before it to consider as one that I cannot say was raised in the petition for certiorari, but I can say it was certainly an issue in the case and appears to have been decided by this Court at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.570" offset="5905638">It would seem then that if in fact it is an ad hoc approach that we must take, you must examine in each case to “Vaca” the circumstances of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.887" offset="5958928">The union has always glossed over the real relationship between Mr. Foust and the defendant in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.909" offset="6003022">The problems between Mr. Foust as the record reflects in each and every instance is that in April of 1970 Mr. Foust contacted Mr. Jones whose deposition was referred to in prior argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.412" offset="6057044">Mr. Foust received no response to that and indeed subsequently contacted Mr. Jones again in November, through his counsel Mr. Moriadi (ph) who was then representing him in the matter of his personal injury FELA (ph) case with the Railroad asking why some action had not been taken on the 1970 written letter, which is in the record to Mr. Jones, no action had occurred on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.152" offset="6171982">On September 8, meanwhile, the union was conferring among itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.066" offset="6191626">Mr. Wisniski, the other defendant and Mr. Jones in fact were writing letters to each other about what to do about Mr. Foust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.293" offset="6224541">Neither of them contacted Mr. Foust until December 8, however and then Mr. Jones and Mr. Foust had a telephone conversation in which Mr. Foust alleged that Mr. Jones told him that the union would do nothing for Mr. Foust, because he had retained counsel in his FELA case and therefore he could take his counsel and do as he would with his contract relationship with the Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.700" offset="6334151">That is a disputed fact before the Court, but taking the rule, the evidence most favorable to the prevailing party that seems to be an appropriate fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.364" offset="6376782">The next item is that the Railroad than became involved with Mr. Foust and there were two pieces of correspondence resulting in the February 3 letter discharging Mr. Foust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.887" offset="6426937">That letter purportedly by the union to be only a relationship only dealing with a relationship between Mr. Foust and the Railroad was the termination letter with copies sent to Mr. Wisniski, the other defendant in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.960" offset="6495169">Consequently, Mr. Wisniski, and the record reflects this there upon two days later, Mr. Foust was discharged on February 3 and two days later on February 5, Mr. Wisniski again wrote to Mr. Jones saying, please send me all that you have on this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.440" offset="6561102">Promptly thereafter Mr. Jones responded to Mr. Wisniski by sending him a copy of a leave of absence form and that was all that he had in his records, Mr. Jones had in his records relating to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.384" offset="6612929">Again the union had no correspondence with Mr. Foust directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.534" offset="6637484">Subsequently Mr. Moriadi (ph) thereafter, the attorney for Mr. Foust, in an attempt believing that the discharge was so patently wrongful on its face it could simply be resolved by confrontation with the Railroad, wrote to the officer who had signed the discharge letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.170" offset="6712090">He received no response; again these matters are in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.506" offset="6725360">He received no response; he called that same officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.323" offset="6736645">That officer said, well this is a matter for the union to take up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.391" offset="6748975">Mr. Moriadi (ph) then on March 26 and that letter is set out in a footnote in the opinion of the Tenth Circuit, but Mr. Moriadi (ph) then wrote to Mr. Jones of the union that was either the 51 or 52 day, the record says 51, there is argument that it may have been the 52 day, but in any event, we know that that letter was received, it was mailed on the 26, March and that was the taking with the date most favorable to the union even the 52 day and received in Rawlins where Mr. Jones was on the 27, the 53 day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.451" offset="6905187">Mr. Jones promptly called Mr. Wisniski, the other defendant, and he said now what do I do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.002" offset="6931414">And Mr. Wisniski promptly wrote the letter set forth of the 5, April, one day too late saying, he typed that letter and he sent it to Mr. Jones and he said to Mr. Jones now you mail that to Mr. Foust saying we are not going to recognize his request for us to handle his grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.303" offset="7020544">The simple fact was that was done on March 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.011" offset="7031411">The first correspondence relating to Mr. Foust grievance was March 30, the 55 day, plenty of time in which to obtain the necessary form, which was a very simple letter saying, there is a letter addressed to Mr. H.M. Robertson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.224" offset="7092224">It's in the appendix to the brief and it says, we have a grievance on behalf of Mr. Foust that he was wrongfully discharged; we will send you the details and so, that was a simple proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.825" offset="7134647">All of this took place again between Mr. Wisniski and Mr. Jones of the union without contact to Mr. Foust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.289" offset="7164531">Then again referring to the relationship between Mr. Foust and the union, at that point, the letter of the 5 from Mr. Wisniski to Mr. Jones says you better send this letter, the one saying we are not going to represent you to Mr. Foust, so we don't get any litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.186" offset="7232136">Then promptly, thereafter Mr. Jones sends the notice of grievance to the Railroad and shortly thereafter, on the 9, April sends an explanatory letter to Mr. Foust, the first writing of explanation by the union from April 17, 1972 to April 9, 1971 by the union to Mr. Foust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.077" offset="7323669">That's the relationship that existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.761" offset="7330461">In fact, the letter of grievance -- I refer to it as letter of grievance, the letter to the Carrier, The Railroad is in the record twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.761" offset="7366405">It bears two hand written dates, each written by Mr. Jones both of them unfortunately late, but one of them later than the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.630" offset="7401932">The ultimate decision was that the letter of the 6, the grievance letter of the 6 was the appropriate one.</text>

            <text syncTime="2140.908" offset="8666990">It is my understanding that Section 302, the section dealing with equal responsibility under collective bargaining contracts in strike actions and proceedings in district courts, contemplates not only the ordinary lawsuits for damages, but also such other remedial proceedings both legal and equitable as might be appropriate in the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.478" offset="8753298">In other words, proceedings could for example, be brought by the employers, the labor organizations or interested individual employees under the Declaratory Judgment Act in order to secure declarations from the court of legal rights under the contract.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2185.198" offset="8844204">So the legislative history would indicate that in relationships between the employee and his union, nothing was to be changed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2457.798" offset="9934555">The right here is one that this Court has created and consequently, this Court has left us in the position of adopting those cases like Vaca versus Sipes in trying to sort it out and again we come back to what appears to be almost ad hoc an approach for the district courts and the problem that I have in that is that I do not believe that that is what the subsequent cases would take us to although that is what the brief of appellant begins to lead us to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.620" offset="10057853">And it seems to me that, if you adopt the position of Laburnum Construction Corporate, the United Construction versus Laburnum and the Russell case, International Union United Automobile Workers versus Russell where punitive damages were totally allowed by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.821" offset="10130683">The same is true in Carpenters and again we find the language and the fact of the existence of the punitive damages in Harrison versus the UTU.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.151" offset="10171956">Harrison versus the UTU is in fact a duty of fair representation case as they are characterized that of the implied right created by statute also known as the statutory tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.708" offset="10226186">And so, consequently it seems to me that we have plenty of authority and that the real question is not whether the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in its opinion went far enough, it relied upon the kinds of cases that are set forth in the brief, but whether or not the district court in giving the instruction that it gave on the question of punitive damages was acting lawfully and in accordance with the laws it was then constituted based upon the cases we have cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.023" offset="10355440">The record I believe justifies an award of punitive damages in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.622" offset="10377906">I do not believe that there is any reason to believe based upon the cases that go before that labor unions were ever immunized to the extent that they might conduct themselves in anyway they see fit without fear of the usual remedies available and consequently we feel that the case was tried appropriately in the Tenth Circuit Court opinion is appropriate and correct and we would ask the Court to affirm.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence J. Cohen</label>
            <text syncTime="2602.825" offset="10514683">Briefly, Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to comment on two factual aspects. My opponent has referred to the matter of the 1970 grievance, which Mr. Foust attempted to file.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.299" offset="10580616">Let me say at the outset that I think it has no bearing whatever on the late filing of the discharge claim, but I would like to clarify the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.057" offset="10627636">What is revealed is that after his injury in March of 1970, Mr. Foust was withheld for several days from work by the company's doctor and he felt he should have been paid for those days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.788" offset="10690539">He sent a written grievance to the union dated June 17, 1970 that time he did it by himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.574" offset="10721677">The union representatives conferring among themselves, concluded that this was not a question of interpretation of the contract, but grew out of the injury claim, which had to be handled with an entirely separate department of the railroad outside of collective bargaining agreement or under the Federal Employers Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.638" offset="10833899">In terms of whether Mr. Jones contacted Mr. Foust, the record shows that he contacted him on two occasions by telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.264" offset="10872456">In his April 9, 1971 letter to Foust, he refers to the June 17, 1970 grievance and notes that I stated to you by telephone at that time, that there are no provisions by agreement, by the agreement for filing claims due to medical reasons or injuries and he suggested that this had to be pursued under the FELA, that's page 14(a) of respondents brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.840" offset="10998784">In Mr. Moriadi (ph), that is Mr. Foust prior attorney letter to Jones of November 19, 1970, I'm sorry it's the January 11, 1971 letter, he refers to an additional phone call between them on December, 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.207" offset="11068165">The only points I wish to make on this are that, the matter was not ignored and that the union representatives concluded as a matter of substance that it related to a matter outside of the collective bargaining agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2840.398" offset="11464913">Mr. Justice Rehnquist I would like to add one further comment to the question you raised before, by pointing out it in a sense Section 8(b)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act, likewise imposes a fiduciary duty on unions vis-à-vis it's members and yet the same universally accepted rule under the NLRA that punitive damages are not available would obtain and we go from there to the fact that under 303 as held in Morton and under 301 as held in Howard Johnson, the remedial principles at the NLRA extend to the LMRA as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="2894.427" offset="11681102">I hope we can take it as given that under the National Labor Relations Act as such the 1935 Act, that only remedial relief is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.430" offset="11721122">In 1947, Congress amended that act through the Labor Management Relations Act and it provided some new -- first of all it provided new set of Union Unfair Labor Practices including 8(b)(2) that they may not ask for the discrimination of employee against employees on the basis of membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.701" offset="11802206">And it also added the 303 statutory toward, where does been a breach of a, or there has been a secondary boycott or jurisdictional strike the employer has that additional remedy, but under Teamsters versus Morton only a remedial relief is available and also an independent breach of contract action and that is 301.</text>
