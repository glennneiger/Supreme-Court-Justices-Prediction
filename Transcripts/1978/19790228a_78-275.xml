            <label>Mr. James W. Gladden, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="47.531" offset="293491">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.550" offset="305612">The issue presented in this case is whether under Section 14(b) of the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, when a state has a law which prohibits age discrimination and employment and has established an agency and power to grant relief from such practices, must a claim of age discrimination first be filed with that state agency before the claimant may initiate an action in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.490" offset="409370">The facts of this case maybe stated very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.671" offset="422013">Respondent Joseph Evans retired in January 1976 from his position as hog buyer for Oscar Mayer in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.077" offset="455659">In March, 1976, Mr. Evans filed a notice of intent to sue with the United States Department of Labor claiming that he had been forced to retire in violation of the Age Discrimination Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.033" offset="507486">At the time of Mr. Evans alleged forced retirement, the Iowa Civil Rights Act prohibited age discrimination in employment and established the Iowa Civil Rights Commission to investigate an attempt to conciliate all charges of age discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.155" offset="580002">In addition, the Iowa Civil Rights Commission was empowered, if it was unable to settle a charge through conciliation, to hold hearings and if it found that a discriminatory practice had been engaged in to order cease and desist and award back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.736" offset="650324">Mr. Evans ignored the available avenue of state relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.305" offset="668609">He did not a file a claim at any time with the Iowa Civil Rights Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.424" offset="685119">Rather one year after he had filed his notice of intent to sue with the United States Department of Labor, he instituted an action in the Federal District Court in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.843" offset="722735">The defendants in that action and petitioners here are the company Oscar Mayer and four of its management employees who were involved in the decision with respect to his retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.634" offset="765889">Oscar Mayer and the other defendants in the trial court below move to dismiss the action for the reason that Mr. Evans had failed to file a claim with the Iowa Civil Rights Commission as Oscar Mayer contended was required by Section 14(b) of the Age Discrimination Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.890" offset="838928">Section 14(b) requires and it is found in page 2 of our brief and I quote “In the case of an alleged unlawful practice occurring in a state, which has a law prohibiting discrimination in employment because of age and establishing or authorizing a state authority to grant or seek relief from such discriminatory practice, no suit maybe brought under Section 626 of this title before the expiration of 60 days after proceedings have been commenced under the State Law unless such proceedings have been earlier terminated.”</text>
            <text syncTime="222.927" offset="995035">In the trial court in response to the motion to dismiss, respondent conceded that Iowa has an age discrimination law and that it has established an agency and is therefore within the terms of Section 14(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="237.282" offset="1052505">Respondent also conceded that he at no time filed a charge with the Iowa Civil Rights Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.664" offset="1082075">The trial judge however denied the motion to dismiss, holding the filing of a charge with the state agency was not required by Section 14(b) as a prerequisite to instituting action in the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.697" offset="1142157">Rather he concluded that Section 14(b) gave an age claimant the option of determining whether or not to avail himself of an available state remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.453" offset="1189177">Trial judge certified his order and the appeal was taken to the Eighth Circuit under Section 1292(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="277.683" offset="1214151">In its first decision, the Eighth Circuit reversed the trial court and held that Section 14(b) did require prior resort to the state agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.830" offset="1250722">On rehearing, the Eighth Circuit changed its position and by divided panel concluded that while the issue was not free from doubt, the preferable view was that Section 14(b) gave an age claimant the option that he was not required to file with the state agency.</text>

            <label>Mr. James W. Gladden, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="311.408" offset="1349047">One judge changed his mind on the petition, after the petition for rehearing was filed; there was not an En Banc here.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.046" offset="1375587">It is petitioner's position that Section 14(b) establishes a prerequisite with -- which must be complied with prior to instituting action in Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.303" offset="1424593">It is our position that the language of the statute is clear and further that requiring resort to an available state remedy is completely consistent for the purposes of the Age Discrimination Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.600" offset="1473808">As I just read the language to you, it specifically says where a state has a law and an agency to enforce that law, no suit maybe brought under Section 626 of this title before the expiration of 60 days after proceedings have been commenced under the state law.</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="362.989" offset="1555310">Mr. Gladden it doesn't say that proceedings must be commenced under the state law now, does it?</text>

            <label>Mr. James W. Gladden, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="368.257" offset="1576417">It does not say it must be commenced, but it says no suit maybe brought and I think if you will look at Section 7(b), which deals with filing an action in Federal Court, it says no suit maybe commenced until notice is given to the Department of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.088" offset="1635767">That particular provision using the same language “no suit maybe commenced” is uniformly accepted by the courts as requiring the filing of notice of intent to suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.317" offset="1676622">Equally is important this language in Section 14(b) is titled precisely after language which appears in 706(c) of Title VII, which is also quoted at page 2 of our brief and reads almost identically.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.780" offset="1738480">It says and I quote “In the case of an alleged unlawful employment practice occurring in a state, which has a law prohibiting the unlawful employment practice alleged and establishing or authorizing a state authority to grant or seek relief from such practice, no charge maybe filed by the person aggrieved before the expiration of 60 days after proceedings have been commenced under the state law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="434.447" offset="1841194">Now that particular provision has been uniformly held to require a person to file a charge with the state agency before he may initiate proceedings under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.804" offset="1882572">Indeed this Court in decision Love versus Pullman agreed with that position of the lower courts and it is our position and just like in Title VII, requiring prior resort to a state agency clearly serves the purposes of the Age and Discrimination Act --</text>

            <text syncTime="470.028" offset="1983509">Because unlike Section 7(b) which says that until the individual has given the secretary notice there is nothing here that requires that the proceedings be commenced before the state agency?</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="483.694" offset="2038157">You can read it either way is all I am saying.</text>

          <turn speaker="james_w_gladden_jr" startTime="486.113" stopTime="664.563">
            <label>Mr. James W. Gladden, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="486.113" offset="2047875">Well, I think you could technically read it either way, but I think when you look at the fact that the language was taken from Title VII and the consistent interpretation of Title VII, I think the far better reading and I think the more the reading which I think gives more meaning to the language of the section is one which needs it as a requirement and it's our position that this making it a requirement is every consistent with the purposes underlying the Age Discrimination Act, because the Act encourages conciliation of disputes rather than litigation of such disputes and by requiring resort to state agencies you maximize the possibility of a non-judicial resolution of such disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.523" offset="2225507">I think it's important to recognize that in 1976 and in 1977 over 5000 charges of age discrimination were filed each year with the United States Department of Labor and that as of end of fiscal 1977, there was a backlog of over 2000 cases before the Department of Labor, this with respect to the notices of intent to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.986" offset="2311293">In 1977, 86 cases were filed by the Department of Labor, but there were 433 individual actions filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.550" offset="2349537">Since the Department of Labor has enforcement responsibilities under 82 different laws, it's not easy to, it's easy to see why this backlog is growing and this led to statements of congressional concern with respect to the handling of age discrimination claims during the consideration of 1978 Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.234" offset="2428322">Now it is our feeling that given this problem, state authorities clearly have a necessary effective and viable means of assisting and handling this growing number of age discrimination complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.338" offset="2476701">There are at least 30 states which have both a law and have established authorities to deal with age discrimination complaints and therefore would be qualified for coverage under Section 14(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="605.418" offset="2525080">Given the number of states which have acted in this area, we think they have a clear role to play.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.043" offset="2547545">If the position of the respondent is accepted and a petitioner, excuse me, and an age claimant is given the option of whether or not to file with the state agency, he is in a position to ignore the state agency, file a notice of intent to sue with an overextended Department of Labor and then proceed immediately in the Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.382" offset="2628942">The Solicitor General in his amicus brief concedes that the state agency could help where it may have been a mistake, which led to the charge or where there maybe simple facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.265" offset="2668440">However, the Solicitor contends that since a claimant could refuse to cooperate with a state agency and then go off to Federal Court that you should not require a claimant to file a charge with a state agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.284" offset="2716505">It is our position that it is improper to determine whether or not a person should be required to file a charge with a state agency on the basis of whether or not he's willing to cooperate with that agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="693.893" offset="2878986">No, there's -- then toward the end of the consideration, a representative of organized labor and a representative of one of the state agencies raised the question with Congress with respect to the possibility that the Age Discrimination Act is then drafted would preempt states and preclude them from age discrimination enforcement and these two people suggested to Congress that they follow the Title VII procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.892" offset="2970937">Subsequent to that testimony, Section 14(b) was added to the act, that's all of the legislative history.</text>

            <text syncTime="731.556" offset="3029556">With respect to the question, I think this question of cooperation or lack thereof also could be made with respect to Title VII, yet no court has ever said that the reason that they -- even though a person could defeat state agencies acting in Title VII by failing to cooperate, he should be excused from going to a state agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.669" offset="3110013">Now the Solicitor and the respondent both rely on this Court's opinion in Lorillard versus Pons decided last term where this Court held that there was a right to a jury trail for age discrimination claimants and they particularly pointed to the language in that case where this Court stated the Title VII was not a reliable guide to interpreting the Age Discrimination Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.475" offset="3193292">However, the Court did recognize in that opinion that the age discrimination act was a hybrid taking some provisions from Title VII, taking some provisions from the Fair Labor Standards Act and that therefore they pointed out, and it's at page 582 of the opinion, this selectivity the Congress exhibited in incorporating provisions and in modifying certain Fair Labor Standards Act practices strongly suggest that but for those changes Congress expressly made, it intended to incorporate fully the remedies and procedures of the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.562" offset="3337592">Now it's our feeling that Section 14(b) is clearly one of those exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.321" offset="3360684">The language is taken directly from Title VII.</text>

            <text syncTime="860.004" offset="3543437">What they held was that the deferral procedure whereby as I recall the opinion, where the deferral procedure whereby you could defer a case if it was a charge, as initially filed at EEOC then it could be deferred to the state and then comeback to the agency after 60 days and that satisfies the requirement of going to the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="888.086" offset="3655764">That's my -- as I say, this has been, the respondent and Solicitor both accept that proposition and the courts have uniformly accepted, lower courts have uniformly cited the Love versus Pullman case for the proposition, the prior resort -- that this Court agreed to prior resort that a state agency was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.901" offset="3738937">With respect to the Lorillard opinion I might go on, this Court did also state in there that where Congress adopts a new law incorporating sections of a prior law that normally Congress will be presumed, have knowledge of the interpretation given to the incorporated law.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.209" offset="3808214">There are two differences between the Age Discrimination Act and Title VII to which Solicitor and the respondent point.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.055" offset="3839561">One being that you may file a concurrent charge with both the Department of Labor and a state agency under the Age Discrimination Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.807" offset="3874565">We do not feel that the fact that you can file a concurrent charge means that the stage agency should be ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.841" offset="3898702">This was obviously Congress' effort to speedup the administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.095" offset="3919705">And we do not -- we still feel that a state can play a meaningful role in disposing even of a charge which is filed concurrently with the charge filed with the Federal Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.474" offset="3957217">Likewise, I think the fact that if a Federal lawsuit is filed under the Age Discrimination Act, it supersedes the filing of a charge before a state agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.235" offset="4008312">I do not think that means that a state agency should be ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.617" offset="4021791">This provision merely avoids duplication once a lawsuit has been instituted, but the fact that a state agency cannot conclude a proceeding does not mean it should not commence the proceeding, because if it is making meaningful progress there's no requirement that the lawsuit be immediately filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.097" offset="4087724">The requirement is that the state be given a minimum of 60 days, a petitioner does not have to file until at least two years and if he alleges a willful violation, three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.951" offset="4131192">So that if a state is making meaningful progress, he does not have to go to court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1036.942" offset="4251146">Having reviewed that decision over lunch, I think it is important to point out that the Court of Appeals there held that the charge of discrimination had not been properly filed with the EEOC in accordance with the requirements of the act and this Court then specified that there were two such requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.900" offset="4314990">One being 706(b), which under the amendments of 1972 became 706(c) and the other one being 706(d), which was dealing with the time within which it needed to be filed with EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.541" offset="4361488">This Court then reviewed the procedure that was followed there, indicated in the facts there had been a referral to the state agency and the state agency had declined to act and then the Court held that the procedure complies with both the purpose, excuse me, complies with the purpose both of 706(b) to give state agencies a prior opportunity to consider discrimination complaints and of 706(d) to ensure expedition, excuse me, to ensure expedition in the filing and handling of those complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.853" offset="4478830">In this case, it has been assumed and presumed by all to have held that you had to have to take a prior resort to a state agency before you could file a charge under Title VII.</text>

            <text syncTime="1110.400" offset="4544972">I think it's important to point out that recognizing the close relationship and the similarities between the Age Discrimination Act and Title VII, in February 1978, President Carter proposed a reorganization of Civil Rights enforcement and this was submitted to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.394" offset="4612995">Congress did not act and therefore this reorganization will go into affect and pursuant to this reorganization, the enforcement of the Age Discrimination Act is transferred to the EEOC has of July 1, 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.478" offset="4665240">This transfer was being undertaken to avoid confusion and the overlapping enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.643" offset="4685928">The EEOC has throughout its history, worked closely with state agencies in enforcing discrimination complaints and indeed in the 1972 amendments to the Title VII, if the EEOC is acting on a commissioner's charge as opposed to an individual charge, it still must refer that individual, excuse me, that commissioner's charge to a state agency before it may undertake its investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.189" offset="4768162">Iowa and most other states with age discrimination statutes have the same agency to enforce age discrimination, race and sex discrimination and to our feeling it simply makes no sense to treat two identically awarded statutory provisions to be enforced by the same agency in two different matters, this simply will not reduce the confusion to which the President was referring when he proposed this reorganization.</text>

            <text syncTime="1354.747" offset="5522369">No, there is no legislative history in those terms with respect to the 1967 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.416" offset="5552985">It was very, as I say indicated that the legislative history with respect to Title VII was very specific that they wanted prior resort to the state agency and the 1967 Age Act we feel adopted that language and therefore adopted basically the position which was being expressed by the senators with respect to Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.315" offset="5620590">I think it's important at this point to turn to the fact that although there was no change in Section 14(b) in the 1978 amendments to the Age Discrimination Act, the Solicitor and the respondent both point to the Senate report which was adopted by the conference committee, which concluded that Section 14(b) had not been intended to require prior resort to the State and that they merely been intended to give the claimant an option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.611" offset="5733857">It's our feeling that observations 10 years after the passage of an act clearly are not part of its legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.098" offset="5755800">In addition, in 1978, as a Solicitor admits in his brief Congress amended the act to alter judicial decisions, which in Congress' view had been unfaithful to the act and they made specific amendments, both substantive amendments and procedural amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.357" offset="5816822">First of all, they made a substantive amendment with respect to retirement plans overruling this Court's opinion in the McMahon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.097" offset="5843780">Secondly, with respect to the notice of intent to sue requirement, the Secretary of Labor since there had been a good deal of litigation with respect to what is a Notice of Intent to sue and what is not a Notice of Intent to sue they made a change saying that, making it simply if you had to file a charge with the Department of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.524" offset="5905429">They also made a change with respect to how the statute of limitations was to be treated, saying that the statute could be told during the period of time when the secretary was undertaking conciliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.807" offset="5946598">At that time the 1978 amendments were being considered, the only two Courts of Appeal which had addressed this question of Section 14(b) had both held that prior resort to a State agency was mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.471" offset="5993305">Yet Congress made no change at all in Section 14(b) and the fact that they did not make the change while they made other procedural changes seems to me indicates that no weight should be given to the senate report, which was part of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.630" offset="6049938">Now, the respondent and the Solicitor both ask this Court that even if this Court adopts the position that Section 14(b) establishes a prerequisite to the filing of an action under the Age Discrimination Act that this Court should also adopt a Doctrine of Equitable Modification whereby on a case-by-case basis, an individual age claimant should be able to show why it should be excused from this requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.982" offset="6151293">I think it's important to understand what this position entails.</text>

            <text syncTime="1526.001" offset="6207404">In effect, they are asking this Court to say that courts can rewrite the statute and drop the requirement altogether if the person can present sufficient factual circumstances to justify that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.628" offset="6249932">This will obviously create confusion as to wonder which circumstances there would be a private right of action and under which circumstance is a private right of action is preserved or not preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.877" offset="6290892">I think it's important to recognize that any age claimant will then attempt to posit to the court a set of circumstances, which would justify his being excused if he has not filed, which creates another issue and we feel simply encourages litigation, even in situations where courts have allowed polling in the statute of limitations, they have made every effort to develop a very much objective standard of polling, so as to avoid long requirement issues being raised as to whether or not this person should be excused from the requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.492" offset="6425370">We feel that in short, Congress did not change Section 14(b) at the time of its consideration of the 1978 amendments, even though numerous plaintiffs had their cases dismissed on those grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.787" offset="6470510">And because of the identity of the language between Title VII and Age Discrimination Act and the obvious benefits from state participation in handling the ever increasing numbers of charges in this area, we feel that this clearly indicates that Court should reverse the Eighth Circuit and remand this case to the district court with instructions to dismiss, thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1622.069" offset="6591613">This is a hard case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.103" offset="6599764">It is hard because the statutory language is so ambiguous that it can support either alternative before the Court and because the petitioner has advanced appealing arguments in his brief, the reversal of the result reached below will alleviate congestion in the Federal Courts, but these arguments are more seductive than they are persuasive as I will show.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.089" offset="6683773">First, let us keep matters in perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.397" offset="6692968">There is no question that a person with a complaint of age discrimination may vindicate his right in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.411" offset="6720972">He is required to give the Secretary of Labor 60 days notice of his intent to do so, which is now a charge as a result of the 78th amendment and during that 60 days the act requires the secretary to attempt to bring about conciliation through informal methods of persuasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.357" offset="6796831">The question here before this Court is whether the act also erects an additional procedural obstacle that the plaintiff must clear before he can go to Federal Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1705.927" offset="6927130">The question here is whether the, in addition to giving the secretary 60 days to settle the case the complainant must also in effect give the State 60 days to do the same thing, if the discrimination took place in a State that has an agency setup to handle age discrimination claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.594" offset="6993795">Now we are not talking here in this case about exhaustion of state remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.831" offset="7010722">Petitioner concedes that the most of the statute can require is that the claimant file his charge with the state agency and then wait 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.328" offset="7048652">After that 60 days, the claimant has an unfettered right to go into Federal Court regardless what the state may or may not have done to his complaint in the mean time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.443" offset="7093164">That requirement if this Court holds that it is a requirement is we think a procedural monkey-wrench in the administration of this act that will serve neither the states nor the plaintiffs nor the Federal Courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2099.354" offset="8500746">So, what we are saying is that to hold that an employee must go to the state agency as a general rule of law is not going to alleviate any burden on the federal courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2707.600" offset="10933791">But the collective wisdom of the holiday Gabriele and the Court Bureau established three major principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.809" offset="10958660">One is that Section 14(b) of the ADEA is not the mere image of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.354" offset="10984782">There are some differences which I will get to and I think those differences are important and affect the interpretation to the given Section 14(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.445" offset="11017174">Secondly the legislative history of the ADEA is not instructive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.571" offset="11029608">It is perhaps silent on the proper interpretation to the given Section 14(b) and finally that absent congressionally expressed intent to the contrary Section 14(b) should be construed to assist the intended beneficiaries of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.175" offset="11108080">Turning to the first proposition, the Section 14(b) is not the mirror image of Section 706(c) of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.311" offset="11140577">Throughout the litigation in this case petitioners would have us believe that the mere incantation of the analogy that Section 706(c) resolves the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.267" offset="11184462">I think it takes additional analysis, the language is not identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.063" offset="11203584">Under Section 706(c) of Title VII, the appropriate terminology is no charge maybe filed, “With the EEOC.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.298" offset="11240573">That gives a State a mandatory 60-day deferral opportunity to deal with the alleged discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.743" offset="11274324">All Federal action is precluded and the filing of suit is likewise precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.443" offset="11301177">On the other hand under Section 14(b) of the Age Discrimination Employment Act no suit maybe brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.540" offset="11329494">However as Mr. Justice Rehnquist previously recognized, this allows for a multitude of opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.553" offset="11361573">For example, there can be simultaneous jurisdiction where the state's deferral agency and the Department of Labor go at it simultaneously or the state can go first or that the Federal government can go first or the Federal government can go first or the state can go first, they haven’t clarified it in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.374" offset="11432835">Now the effect of the difference in the language is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.131" offset="11447881">Under Title VII the states have exclusive jurisdiction for 60 days, under the ADEA there is no exclusive jurisdiction, there is either simultaneous or consecutive in any order that the claimant may go.</text>

            <text syncTime="3562.957" offset="14355205">I would add just briefly that the major changes administratively that were made were in response with the EEOCs handling of charges under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.784" offset="14390523">What they did away with was the notice of right to sue, the fact that the agency had to make a finding of reasonable cause, those are the things that were changed, they also gave this enforcement to the Department of Labor instead of the EEOC, those are the things that were changed with respect to going to a state or not going to state, the language of 14(b) is identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.815" offset="14470666">And I might also point out than with respect to filing a charge with the Department of Labor, the section 7(b) provides that if you do go to -- if you’re in a state which is covered by 14(b) you have 300 days to file your charge to the department, you notice to intent to sue are now a charge to the Department of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.819" offset="14534614">If you’re not in a State covered by 14(b) you only have a 180 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.257" offset="14552377">Clearly that’s giving deference to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.513" offset="14561468">It’s encouraging the party to go to the State because it extents its period of time over which you can come to the Federal Government if the state doesn’t start moving along in a meaningful way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.749" offset="14598353">That 180, 300 day pattern is exactly the same pattern that is followed under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.063" offset="14623640">So with respect to the States and the effective filing a charge or notice to the state, the pattern is identical in the Age Discrimination Act to Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.891" offset="14654986">The changes that were made had to do with what the EEOC had been required to do under Title VII as opposed to what the Department of Labor was required to do and that was an effort to speedup the administrating process primarily at the Federal level.</text>
