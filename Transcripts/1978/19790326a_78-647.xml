            <text syncTime="1929.158" offset="7819995">I think to understand the question, we do have to go back into the background of the system, the political structure of the State of Washington and the governmental structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.534" offset="7869524">It's been of -- we're still fairly young state, but of some 70 years duration has there been this structure of 39 counties with 39 separate governments each having their own elected representatives, excuse me, legislative executive in judicial branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.264" offset="7940472">They elect their own county judges, the county commissioners and executives, prosecuting attorneys, county clerks and so on down the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.854" offset="7974745">The state has authorized by a section just one following this, and in the same basic enabling Act in 1907, the existence of county committees which are composed of precinct committee men elected in each county.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.393" offset="8048933">These organizations of course parallel the county governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.058" offset="8075577">Then the county committee of each county selects two members to the State Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.481" offset="8105253">It originally was just one in 1907, and 1927 as I recall, they added the rights of one man or/and one woman from each county.</text>

            <text syncTime="2035.044" offset="8243597">However, the state charter attempted to put the counties in line a little bit and did say that they do have a limitation upon them, and that is that they should attempt at least to follow the policy set forth in the national charter, the state -- excuse me, the national platform, the state platform and the county platform.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.261" offset="8332413">The State Committee as I said was -- is elected by the -- composed of these people from the county committees, two from each, and just provides a skeleton of the state party and as an administrative, not an electoral and not a policy making body.</text>
