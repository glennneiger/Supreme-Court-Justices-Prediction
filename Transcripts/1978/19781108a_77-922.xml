            <label>Mr. Burt Braverman</label>
            <text syncTime="50.641" offset="305925">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.445" offset="321181">This is what is known as a reverse-Freedom of Information Act case, an action to enjoin certain government agencies from disclosing documents that are asserted to be confidential in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.058" offset="375620">The action was brought against the respondent Defense Logistics Agency, Department of Labor, Department of Defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.946" offset="411146">The issues in this case concern the extent to which these agencies are prohibited by federal statutes and regulations from disclosing confidential business information and also the extent to which the petitioner Chrysler Corporation is entitled to a de novo trail.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.750" offset="486379">The case arose as follows; The respondent agencies notified Chrysler that two requests for disclosure of documents had been received and that those requests were made under Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.747" offset="542386">They advised Chrysler that it could object to the disclosure of those documents if it chose.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.363" offset="564851">The documents in this case were of two types.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.018" offset="575404">The first called an affirmative action program or an AAP consisted of several hundred pages of extremely detailed employment data.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.906" offset="615006">The data in essence was blue print or a hand book of the organization and staffing of Chrysler’s assembly plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.437" offset="653145">The second kind of document involved was a government report, which was prepared concerning a review of those facilities and the compliance of those facilities with various regulations applicable to government contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.941" offset="715107">Those government reports incorporated into them substantial portions of the data that was included in the affirmative action programs themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.731" offset="754291">And I want to note at this point that the data included in Chrysler’s AAPs is viewed by Chrysler as confidential in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.567" offset="793684">It is covered by various written confidentiality policies and practices of the corporation, and the corporation and its employees are expressly restricted from disclosing that data either to competitors or to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.793" offset="858572">The respondents permitted written objections to be filed to disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.095" offset="883754">Chrysler objected on essentially two bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.542" offset="897546">First it asserted that the information was exempt from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.762" offset="930461">That exemption says that the disclosure mandate of the Freedom of Information Act shall not apply to information, which is confidential and commercial in nature or trade secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.513" offset="981452">And second it asserted that disclosure of these documents was prohibited by the federal Trade Secrets Act 18 U.S.C., Section 1905, which makes it a crime for any federal employee to disclose certain specified types of confidential, business statistical data, such as was contained in the AAPs.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.443" offset="1069119">The respondents decided the issue against Chrysler and informed Chrysler that the documents would be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.770" offset="1102451">Although Chrysler was supposedly afforded a right to appeal administratively from that determination, it was not allowed to do so because the agency indicated that it would not await the results of that appeal prior to disclosing the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.820" offset="1178624">Consequently Chrysler having exhausted it's administrative remedies was compelled to institute an injunctive action in the District Court for Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.120" offset="1215822">Following a de novo trail in which the District Court heard the testimony of expert witnesses and other witnesses concerning the nature of the information at issue and the consequences of disclosure of that information to the public, the District Court issued its decision in which it held that first the information was in fact exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act because it was confidential in nature and because its disclosure would cause substantial competitive injury to Chrysler.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.858" offset="1346853">And second it held that disclosure of that information would violate the Trade Secrets Act as well as certain parallel provisions of the defendant’s regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.324" offset="1388648">Consequently it enjoined the disclosure of those portions of the documents, which it found to be exempt from disclosure.</text>

            <text syncTime="333.605" offset="1437759">Isn’t one of the black letter principles of equity that court of equity will not enjoin a criminal act?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="burt_braverman" startTime="340.528" stopTime="362.280">
            <label>Mr. Burt Braverman</label>
            <text syncTime="340.528" offset="1465448">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.471" offset="1469210">However it would be an abuse of discretion of course if the agency were to exercise its discretion to disclose documents in violation of that law, and to prevent that abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.751" offset="1526366">In an anticipatory sense the District Court exercised its equitable jurisdiction to enjoin the disclosure.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="362.280" stopTime="367.043">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="362.280" offset="1552488">Well you’re stating then it just didn’t bothered to follow what is on the black letter principle of equity?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="burt_braverman" startTime="367.043" stopTime="691.109">
            <label>Mr. Burt Braverman</label>
            <text syncTime="367.043" offset="1571506">I believe it did bother to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.309" offset="1580596">It realized that it could not await the disclosure of that information to then remedy the problem because once disclosed the confidential information could never be returned to its original state.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.931" offset="1631065">And this Court has recognized in Cort v. Ash that there will be implied a cause of action under certain statutes where the remedy is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute and it has applied that principle in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.555" offset="1701595">And consequently the District Court did in fact I think consider that equitable principle but realized that the information had to be enjoined prior to disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.566" offset="1745586">Again we’re also proceeding under the Freedom of Information Act, which we asserted also provided a basis for the District Court to enjoin disclosure of the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.158" offset="1788008">But the basic answer is that the court found that it would be an abuse of discretion and that the APA permitted it to enjoin the -- provide that injunctive remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.484" offset="1829282">Cross appeals were filed from the District Court’s decision, and the Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.651" offset="1849971">The Court of Appeals held that the District Court had erroneously engaged in a de novo trail that Chrysler’s cause of action did not arise under either the FOIA or the Trade Secrets Act but rather only under the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.686" offset="1910157">And it also held that the federal agencies had discretion to disclose these documents even if they were exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and even if they fell within the Trade Secrets Act if the agencies had some regulation which authorized that disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.571" offset="1989674">The agency found however that – the Court of Appeals found however that the agency's record that it had compiled in the course of deciding these issues was so inadequate as to prevent further review and it remanded the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.755" offset="2058428">This Court has recognized on a number of occasions that the Freedom of Information Act was brought into existence to remedy what had been perceived to be an era of secrecy on the part of government agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.589" offset="2109733">The object of Congress was that if it could open the processes of government to greater public scrutiny, those agencies and the government itself would become more accountable to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.912" offset="2159052">At the same time that it was attempting to end this era of secrecy however, it was aware that businesses such as Chrysler submit vast amounts of business information to federal agencies both voluntarily and in compliance with various regulatory requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.013" offset="2239404">Now some of that information Congress knew could be disclosed without harming the businesses that provided it.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.628" offset="2265840">But it was also aware that significant amounts of that information were of a truly confidential nature and that if that information was disclosed that could impair the competitive or other health of the businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.056" offset="2327594">At the time that the Freedom of Information Act was coming into existence in its early stages 1963, when the Senate hearing were being conducted, there was no exemption in the act for confidential business information, and this omission gave rise to a great hue and cry over the need for such protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.879" offset="2414843">Interestingly the greatest or perhaps the most vocal proponents of the need to protect business documents were the federal agencies themselves. They citied two principal reasons for the need for this protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.481" offset="2469282">First and most obviously was the need to protect businesses, which were either pursuant to regulation or in a corporative effect furnishing confidential information to the agencies to protect these businesses from the harm, which could be caused by disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.055" offset="2535633">And second they realized that this protection was the quit pro quo for the agencies’ ability to obtain this kind of information in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.280" offset="2572518">If the information were not to be respected in its confidentiality the business would no longer furnish that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.014" offset="2599476">And in reaction to this outcry for the need for protection, Congress in fact added what is now the fourth exemption to the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.607" offset="2637824">But Exemption 4 was considerably different than the other exemptions to the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.180" offset="2660080">The other exemptions and for example Exemption 1 or 2 or 5 or 7 dealing with national security secrets, dealing with investigative files, dealing with intra-agency memoranda, these exemptions were designed to protect governmental interests. They were designed to give the agency the option, if it need to, to withhold certain documents from disclosure because governmental interest might truly be impaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.472" offset="2773243">But as to this exemptions Congress still made them permissive only, when I say ‘permissive’ it gave the agencies discretion to withhold those documents if it needed to, but it made clear in the legislative history that those exemptions were not to be invoked unless it was truly necessary to protect the governmental interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="698.620" offset="2897899">It comes through in the sense that although there are statements made concerning the permissive nature of the exemptions the only time that they are made is with respect to those exemptions relating to governmental interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.518" offset="2957458">In contrast, when the Congress remarked concerning Exemption 4, which was an exemption designed to protect private interest, its statements were in the sense of mandatory remarks that the exemption must be enforced and must be utilized to protect those private interests.</text>

            <text syncTime="781.739" offset="3230281">But what I’m trying to make clear is that both the House and Senate indicate that the need was there to protect confidential business information.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.038" offset="3271555">In fact even Attorney General Ramsey Clark, after the act was enacted made the statement that confidential business information must be protected from disclosure and must remain outside the zone of accessibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="821.511" offset="3389419">If we’re conceding in effect that 1, 2, 5 and 7 are permissive then the statute use the same language for 3, 4 and 6 may be you’re putting yourself in a hole.</text>

            <text syncTime="830.800" offset="3426617">The Act says that where information falls within an exemption, the Act shall not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.082" offset="3451695">That’s clear, that is statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.177" offset="3464129">But as the Court Of Appeal has noted in the Westinghouse case, the legislative history reflected so clear, so clear a purpose to protect that information and to continue the practice that had previously existed in government of protecting confidential business information, that this legislative history, these remarks from which I have quoted expressed an affirmation, a mandate that this information be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.304" offset="3568619">It was not simply to be something that the government agencies have the discretion neither to adhere to or not to adhere to.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.790" offset="3598503">Now in this case for example the government takes the position that even where information falls within the Fourth Exemption, even where that information is confidential, even where that information would cause substantial competitive injury of disclosed, the agency still has discretion to disclose that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.029" offset="3675512">We think Congress intended otherwise and intended to provide protection to that information.</text>

            <text syncTime="1380.525" offset="5625501">In fact that is the case with the two requests in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1398.570" offset="5697703">It instead came through the Freedom of Information Act and attempted to get that information in circumvention of the Federal Rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.703" offset="5726229">We think this Court has frowned upon this practice in both in Robins Tyre, in NLRB v. Sears Roebuck where it indicated in an agency context that the Act should not be used for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.137" offset="5771891">And we think that it equally a bar to use the act for this purpose against a private person, particularly where the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do exist as a means of obtaining this data.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.802" offset="5818598">Now I mentioned these examples really to show that the act no longer is being used to find out about government operations but instead is being used to find out about private activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.798" offset="5874604">This unfortunately is not what the act was intended to accomplish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.166" offset="5892054">In allowing these practices it has the effect of undermining the Fourth Exemption, undermining the protection which that Exemption was intended to provide and of upsetting the balance that Congress was trying to fashion between the publics right to know on the one hand and the business communities right to be secure in its property and privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.929" offset="5979094">We think that the decision below by recognizing this broad agency discretion to disclose the very kinds of documents which Exemption 4 was intended to protect, disrupts the legislative scheme is contrary to the legislative history and we urge the court to reverse the decision below.</text>
