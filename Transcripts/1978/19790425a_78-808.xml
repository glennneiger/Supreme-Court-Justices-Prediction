            <text syncTime="93.898" offset="478960">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.904" offset="490977">This case is here on direct appeal by the Government from a decision of the District Court for the Western District of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.675" offset="522115">This is another case questioning the constitutionality of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.358" offset="544789">The particular provision involved here is the marriage requirement for mother's benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.832" offset="570702">The wage earner, Norman W. Boles lived with Margaret Gonzales who is the claimant from 1963 to 1966, but they were never married.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.720" offset="626291">Their son Norman J. Boles was born in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.118" offset="647816">In 1966, the wage earner left Margaret Gonzales and his child and he married Nancy Boles in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.148" offset="687940">There were two children born in this marriage and the wage earner died in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.166" offset="716048">All three children are receiving children's benefits on Norman W. Boles' account.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.882" offset="746872">Mother's benefits are paid to the widow of a wage earner who has an entitled child in her care.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.215" offset="776234">For that reason, Nancy Boles is getting mother's benefits and Margaret Gonzales was denied mother's benefits because she was never married to the wage earner, eventhough her son is receiving benefits and is in her care.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.521" offset="845406">The District Court read this Court's decision in Weinberger versus Wiesenfeld as holding that mother's benefits are for the child to give him the care of his surviving parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.440" offset="897128">The court found that Norman J. Boles, the child, had himself been denied mother's benefits because of his illegitimacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.622" offset="933909">And that that denial was inconsistent with the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.023" offset="975496">It therefore declared Section 202 (g) of the Social Security Act, the mother's benefit provision unconstitutional to the extent that it limited benefits to widows and divorced wives.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.152" offset="1039966">The court enjoined the Secretary from denying mother's benefits to the named plaintiffs or to the class which consists of all illegitimate children and their mothers who are ineligible for mother's benefits solely because they were never married to the wage earner.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.408" offset="1109034">All the children in the class like Norman Boles are getting children's benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.731" offset="1134320">Their only claim is that they have been injured by the failure to pay mother's benefits to their mothers with whom they are living.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.314" offset="1180609">The true requirements for mother's benefits, they are particularly are important here are first, that they are paid to the widow or to persons that Congress has decided should be treated as if they were widows.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.119" offset="1239855">That of course is the marriage requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.932" offset="1251140">Second, the widow must have in her care a child getting benefits because of his relationship to the wage earner, that usually of course would be the widow's child, but it doesn't have to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.362" offset="1304848">It's the child relationship to the wage earner, not to the person that is caring for him that counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.453" offset="1333164">And the child's legitimacy has nothing to do with the widow's entitlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.171" offset="1360018">These two requirements serve analytically different purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.490" offset="1381334">The first, the marriage requirement defines the class of those who are likely to have been dependent on the wage earner during his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.405" offset="1425011">And that class includes all the people that Congress believed were most likely to have lost support when the wage earner died.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.369" offset="1464822">But lost of support is not itself enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.178" offset="1480077">The second, child in care requirement defines the group within the larger class who because of special circumstances are entitled to the replacement of lost support.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.292" offset="1536502">If you don't show membership within this particular subgroup, then Congress felt that eventhough you may have lost support when the wage earner died, you should make up that support through your own efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.290" offset="1600554">Analytically, the child in care provision is very similar to the age requirement for elderly widows.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.930" offset="1635140">The theory behind mother's benefits is that a wife with an entitled child in her care should have the same option that she had before her husband's death.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.899" offset="1678921">That is, either to stay home, supported by her husband to take care of the children, or else to work and help to support the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.734" offset="1726360">The theory is that she shouldn't lose this choice when the wage earner dies, and that's why she gets the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.192" offset="1764185">The important point is that the class definition, the marriage requirement sets the outer limits of those Congress found likely to have lost support.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.973" offset="1811310">It is the group definition is a limitation on the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.203" offset="1828133">It defines the people within the class who are entitled to the replacement of lost support.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.619" offset="1857808">Ms. Gonzales never married the wage earner.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.771" offset="1870451">She can't meet any of the other tests that Congress has used to identify people who are so likely to have lost support at the wage earners death that they should be treated as though they were married.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.455" offset="1921233">There is no indication in the record in fact that these tests were inaccurate as to Ms. Gonzales.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.692" offset="1950177">There's no suggestion that she was in fact supported by the wage earner that she lost any support when he died.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.844" offset="1990719">Since she doesn't belong to the class that Congress has identified as likely to have lost support, she's not entitled to benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.435" offset="2033142">This Court's cases strongly support our analysis of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.439" offset="2053099">The Court has frequently accepted the Social Security Acts use of marriage to show the likelihood of support.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.773" offset="2086431">And it has rejected claims that marriage is to inaccurate or imprecise, an indicator of the likelihood of support to serve as a basis for denying claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.919" offset="2139094">And it has also refused to require that people who cannot meet some particular part of the marriage requirement should be entitled to prove that they were in fact dependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.000" offset="2203355">And there's no reason to reach a different result here.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.066" offset="2219656">The court below believed Wiesenfeld required the different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.849" offset="2234807">It said that this Court held there that mother's benefits are for the child so that he can receive the care of the surviving parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.145" offset="2267930">But that misreads Wiesenfeld.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.044" offset="2279528">The court there was focusing on the class definition for mother's benefits, the definition of the individuals likely to have lost support when the wage earner died.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.377" offset="2320906">It found that husbands as a class are as likely who have lost support when the wage earner dies as are wives.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.980" offset="2355284">Wiesenfeld therefore supports our analysis of the statute because it recognizes that being entitled to mother's benefits depends on membership in the class likely to have lost support when the wage earner died.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.784" offset="2414529">That's the reason that Wiesenfeld was controlling Goldfarb.</text>

            <text syncTime="646.132" offset="2687875">I'm not sure that even in that case, the defendant -- the appellees should win because I'm not sure that if you say that this -- that you have to look at this from the point of view of the child, the statute doesn't really make any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.673" offset="2770108">It's -- you can't look at this as a statute that says mothers of illegitimate children don't get benefits and mothers of legitimate children do.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.943" offset="2815143">The statute simply doesn't operate that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.455" offset="2833220">The cases we've cited in our reply brief show that it's the relationship to the wage earner plus having in you're here an entitled child.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.685" offset="2882121">And if you say that any illegitimate -- the mother of any illegitimate child gets benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.035" offset="2915558">That means that illegitimate children get an advantage that legitimate children don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.140" offset="2947950">And you turn a statute -- you require the statute to favor illegitimates.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.362" offset="3000822">It -- it seriously distorts Wiesenfeld to read it as meaning that the mother's benefit is really a child's benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.828" offset="3030706">The Wiesenfeld child was not a party to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.532" offset="3045543">The court didn't consider his lost of support or need for the replacement of lost support.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.162" offset="3068008">He was already getting benefits based on those needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.651" offset="3085981">It was the surviving husband that was claiming the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.052" offset="3103535">It was his lost of support and his relationship to the wage earner that made him entitled to benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.338" offset="3132688">Neither is it fair to read Wiesenfeld as meaning that Social Security Act benefits are somehow designed to recognize the emotional trauma suffered by a child who loses a parent, and for that reason, entitled him to the care of his surviving parent who could not have stayed home to care for him before the death.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.139" offset="3231953">Appellees here are not arguing that this Court's decision approving the use of the marriage requirement is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.885" offset="3258911">They don't even argue that the decisions of applying the marriage requirement in the particular context of mother's benefits are wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.157" offset="3287960">They are not saying that Salfi was wrongly decided or that De Castro was.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.957" offset="3307186">They argue only that the requirement cannot be used to deprive illegitimate children of mother's benefits because it is a classification based on illegitimacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.937" offset="3347101">But it's not a classification based on the child's legitimacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.803" offset="3362565">It's a classification based on the caretaker's likelihood of lost support that has a disparate effect on illegitimates.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.439" offset="3401122">That's not enough to show a denial of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.195" offset="3420139">Appellees must show an addition at least that their explanation of the statute's purpose explains its operation better than ours does.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.592" offset="3457755">The examples given on our reply brief show that the way the statute operates can only be reasonably explained in terms of the replacement of lost support.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.299" offset="3496521">It's not a grant of benefits to mothers of legitimate children and a denial to mothers of illegitimate ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.034" offset="3527555">Our example show that Congress here as it did throughout the Social Security Act chose to pay benefits only to the people who could show both that they are in a class likely to have lost support and that they have a special need for the replacement of that support.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.895" offset="3594951">The legitimacy of the child being cared for is totally irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.157" offset="3615953">There's another example of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.907" offset="3627029">When a woman dies living young children, the surviving wage earner's mother or other relative often moves into the household to care for the children and she's then supported by the wage earner.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.289" offset="3684498">If the wage earner then dies, the grandmother gets no benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.972" offset="3703306">She has the same problem that Ms. Gonzales has here.</text>

            <text syncTime="911.972" offset="3751267">It makes no difference whether the children are legitimate or not in this example.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.232" offset="3780315">Appellees argument boils down to a claim that a statutory scheme that is neutral as regards to legitimacy must be turned into one that favors the mothers of illegitimate children.</text>

            <text syncTime="936.065" offset="3847607">This case presents an extreme example of the risks of seemingly minor changes in the benefit system established by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.742" offset="3878327">First, it distorts the statutory purpose of providing benefits only to those most likely to have been supported by the wage earner.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.483" offset="3921272">Second, the extension of benefits to an additional group means that the real purpose of the benefits may be lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.597" offset="3961710">Neither the new group nor the group that Congress defined may actually get enough support to stay home to care for children.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.217" offset="3996191">This is because the statute limits the total amount payable on any given wage earner's amount -- account in anyone must.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.859" offset="4034853">The maximum will always be reached when three survivors are being paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.641" offset="4057945">So, when you have a widow and a child being paid benefits in one household and an entitled child in another household, you will have reached the statutory maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.249" offset="4104338">If you add the mother of the entitled child, then, the benefits that were previously payable will have to be reallocated from the benefits that were going to three people, the same benefits have to go to four people.</text>

            <text syncTime="1280.331" offset="5224678">I believe a simple example illustrates the discriminatory effect on illegitimate children of the marriage requirement for mother's benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.242" offset="5264384">If we have a wage earner who lives with the woman, has a child with that woman, lives with and supports that child everyday of the child's life until the wage earner dies, but has never married the mother, that family unit is deprived of mother's benefits and the child is deprived of the opportunity for the care of the mother afforded by mother's benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.068" offset="5359679">On the other hand, if we have a wage earner who marries a woman and while she's pregnant deserts her, never sees the child, never supports the child and dies, that family unit is entitled to mother's benefits and that child receives a benefit of a care of the mother which mother's benefits makes possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.176" offset="5452048">The distinction between the two groups is simply that in one case, the mother and the father married and that the other case, they have not married.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.630" offset="5481932">And that is precisely the kind of statute which visits the sins of the parents on the child by depriving the child of a benefit, a social welfare benefit, merely because of the lack of marriage of the parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.698" offset="5546193">And the bar here is absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.771" offset="5558418">This is not a case like Lucas where the illegitimate child can come in and prove dependency, or where the child and the mother could come in and prove that they had actually been supported by the father of the child at the time of his death.</text>

            <text syncTime="1567.214" offset="6372185">But the court nevertheless held that discrimination between legitimate children and illegitimate children similarly situated was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.868" offset="6406875">In the Webber case for example, involving workers compensation benefits, legitimate children and acknowledge illegitimate children receive benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.824" offset="6450657">Other illegitimate children did not, and the court held that discrimination was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.532" offset="6473540">In the Jimenez case, we had legitimate children and some classes of illegitimate children receiving benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.681" offset="6514082">Other illegitimate children did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.257" offset="6520351">And again, this Court held by looking at illegitimate children and legitimate children similarly situated that there was an unconstitutional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.264" offset="6556400">In fact in every case involving the Social Security Act, there are always some illegitimate children who receive benefits because there's a provision in the Act that children who are illegitimate solely because of a defect in a bonafide marriage between their parents are considered legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.885" offset="6646888">So that we always have some illegitimate children receiving benefits, yet this Court in two different situations has stricken discrimination against illegitimate children in the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.920" offset="6695058">And that's true in almost every other kind of case in which this Court is found discrimination against illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.125" offset="6723897">There had been some -- in some case, a number of maybe small, in others, the number maybe large, in which some illegitimate children have gotten the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.895" offset="6762977">And we would submit that here, the crucial distinction and -- which relates this entire argument of the Government on the likelihood of support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.139" offset="6815953">If the court examines the Jimenez case on the hand and the Lucas case on the other hand, and similarly in the different context Trimble v. Gordon on one hand and Lalli v. Lalli on the hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.648" offset="6866004">The distinction is the absolute bar may base on the failure of the mother and father to marry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.891" offset="6890977">And so, if this was the statute as we had in Lucas in which the family could come in and have an opportunity to demonstrate that in fact there was support for the family, that would be a different case and might be proper and constitutional under Lucas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.199" offset="6964120">Because what Lucas and Jimenez illustrate is that the likelihood of support argument sustains differential treatment only in presuming that all legitimate children are supported, but requiring an additional showing by illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.229" offset="7028276">But that it does not sustain an absolute bar to illegitimate children and in a particular category, those living with their mothers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1946.021" offset="7887496">If we go back to 1939 in the Congress first enacted survivors benefits, the original Social Security Act was simply for retirement, and that in 1939, survivor's benefits were first enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.130" offset="7943920">At that time, illegitimate children were excluded, children's benefits that were provided or provided only for legitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.659" offset="7977984">The Social Security Advisory Board beginning in 1940 expressed itself on that question, pointed to the inequities and urged Congress to correct it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.836" offset="8030751">It wasn't until 1965 that Congress first moved to make some change in the total exclusion of illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.192" offset="8064188">But even in 1965 when they did it, they surrounded the change with a number of discriminatory provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.768" offset="8094490">One of them was a provision that if by adding illegitimate children's -- children's benefits to the total package on the wage earners account, the total benefits were exceed the maximum than illegitimate children lost all their benefits first, and rather than dividing it proportionally as in almost any other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.416" offset="8185083">And that was stricken by this Court in the summary affirmance of both in the Davis and Griffin cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.706" offset="8218206">The second kind of discrimination was before this Court in the Jimenez case where we were dealing with a very small class of children born after the disability of their father.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.676" offset="8266062">And under the statute, illegitimate children were not entitled to benefits and legitimate children were entitled to benefits and this Court found that that was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.156" offset="8307963">And by Congress by leaving the mother's benefit provision with a marriage requirement, continue the discriminatory effect of that on illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.987" offset="8359372">That went back to 1939 when illegitimate children were totally excluded from the statute, and I made sense of course the Congress to say with use the term widow because it was only widows and legitimate children that were involved in the benefit package at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.418" offset="8421021">But that this former discrimination carries over along with these other requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.676" offset="8446098">And again, the provision in the Act that says when legitimate children that -- excuse me, when illegitimate children are illegitimate only by reason of the invalid but good faith marriage of the parents, they are deemed legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.476" offset="8509315">And the mother is then deemed a wife under the same circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.753" offset="8534392">That again I think indicates that what we had was a general statutory scheme of hostility to children because of the failure of their parents to marry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2226.246" offset="9008358">The -- the holding of this Court I submit was very clear in the Wiesenfeld case that the mother's benefit was intended to benefit the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.550" offset="9057573">And in fact, the Government in that case made the same argument that they asserted here that this was essentially spousal support and it was proper for Congress to distinguish between support for wives were normally supported by their husbands as contrasted to support for husbands who are often or perhaps more often than not supported by their wives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.298" offset="9164570">And that was been asserted by the Government as the justification for the classification there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.216" offset="9192260">And the court's decision finds that the benefit was for the child that therefore we have the discrimination based on sex because woman workers do not get the same benefits for their children as male workers would.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.371" offset="9260805">And therefore, there was implicit rejection of the notion that the intent of the statute was for spousal support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.732" offset="9302288">Now, the fact that a marriage requirement is used in statute does not mean that there is no either intended or effect discrimination against illegitimate children.</text>

            <text syncTime="2648.662" offset="10698062">The Social Security Act for example never speaks directly in terms of illegitimacy versus the legitimacy, but this Court has stricken provisions of the statute on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.775" offset="10742471">The Social Security Act always talks in what we might call a neutral term which is children who inherit an intestacy under state law, and that effectively at least until the Trimble decision barred illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.975" offset="10795238">Similarly in the New Jersey Welfare Rights Organization case, we have a statute which provided welfare benefits to families consisting of husband, wife and children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.183" offset="10844139">And this Court struck that as the discrimination against illegitimate children's well, so that there's no magic in the term illegitimacy being written into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.136" offset="10887920">This Court has always taken a look at the -- how the statute operated in practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.624" offset="10921880">The classification of illegitimacy then requires in the constitutional test a little closer look, a little closer scrutiny then it sometimes given to other social welfare benefit cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.603" offset="10981752">I think the court -- this Court has made it clear in everyone of its decisions in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.982" offset="11003277">And the point that Mr. Justice Stevens raised earlier concerning a situation in which Congress may find that only 2% of all mothers of illegitimate children were supported by the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.856" offset="11062836">Of course, Congress has not made that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.829" offset="11074644">There is no nothing in the record, nothing in the legislative history indicates Congress ever considered that, nor could it have considered that because when mother's benefits were adopted, illegitimate children were ineligible for children's benefits, and therefore ipso facto that they were also not receiving mother's benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.250" offset="11156355">And therefore, Congress could not have ever taken up this question at any point in enacting mother's benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.796" offset="11190523">But we would submit that even if Congress had taken that kind of consideration, that a total exclusion of all illegitimate children is not justified by the administrative convenience, that is -- and that was essential the holding of this Court in the Jimenez case where it was argued that after born illegitimate children could be excluded by because relatively few children were involved and that there was an element of administrative convenience in proof of paternity or support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.501" offset="11325419">And I believe what the cases require is a closer look at how the purpose can be achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.347" offset="11348720">If the purpose is to exclude families where the father was not supporting the families and that can be achieved by giving the family the opportunity to prove that they were receiving the support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.981" offset="11403264">If only 2% of the families provide that proof, then only 2% of the families will get the benefit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2871.052" offset="11587584">That's correct, but the difference between third cousins and grandmothers and so on and illegitimate children is of constitutional significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.599" offset="11617782">And this Court has had temptations in which it has held various forms of discrimination against illegitimate children to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.227" offset="11652263">That's just not the case with third cousins or grandmothers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.833" offset="11662712">And when you get to that classification, then the appropriate test is to look carefully at the purpose to be achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.057" offset="11691551">And to meet that test without a total bar of benefits for the class of illegitimate children, and that is the failure of this statute because it bars all benefits to illegitimate children, it bars those benefits whether or not the father had ever supported the children, whether the father had ever supported the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.594" offset="11781726">And because of that reason alone, the statute falls as unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.779" offset="11818506">The -- in the remaining moments, I would like to comment just for a moment on the class action aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.782" offset="11858526">I did not intend to argue on the retroactivity which I believe is well covered in the briefs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2955.834" offset="11926758">Essentially, the class relief here merely requires the Social Security Administration to notify all families in which illegitimate children are receiving children's benefits of the decision of the court, and so that they will know that now they may come in and apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.474" offset="12001259">They will still have to meet all the other statutory requirements for mother's benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="3318.873" offset="13378853">It seemed to me there would be the same probability and it just may be what Mr. Justice White was implying, the same probability that the wage earner was not supporting that particular mother because you really have the same set up whether you describe her as a mother of an illegitimate child or as a person who's not a wife.</text>
