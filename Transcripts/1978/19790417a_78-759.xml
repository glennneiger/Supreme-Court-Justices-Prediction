            <text syncTime="98.434" offset="497142">-- and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.306" offset="508635">The Idaho official appellants in this case believe that the jurisdiction and venue issues that are brought here before the Court are the most important jurisdiction and venue issues relating to federal court jurisdiction over state officials since the decision in 1908 in ex parte Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.110" offset="607796">And that the issues on the merits of this case are very demanding, very interesting in the interrelationship of federal securities laws and state securities laws in a system of cooperative federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.619" offset="681880">This case involves in attempt by the appellee, Great Western United Corporation, a New York Stock Exchange traded, Delaware Corporation with corporate offices in Colorado, executive offices in Texas and which does business throughout the United States to effect a cash partial tender offer for up to two million shares of the outstanding common stock of the Sunshine Mining Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.115" offset="799848">A New York Stock Exchange traded, Washington State Corporation with its principle asset, a silver mine located in the State of Idaho, its corporate offices in the State of Idaho, its executive offices in New York and other substantial assets in the states of Maryland and New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.271" offset="884485">Though in this case, the proposed tender offer was initiated by Great Western United Corporation in Dallas, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.888" offset="922937">The tender offer was announced and disseminated through a New York investment banking firm and the shares were to be tendered to a Chicago, Illinois bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.861" offset="970794">As far as timing is concerned, on Monday, March 21, 1977, Great Western United Corporation simultaneously filed a Scheduled 14D statement with the Securities Exchange Commission as required by the William Act amendment to the 1934 Securities Exchange Act, which relates to cash tender offers for corporate control.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.189" offset="1068178">It voluntarily appeared in the State of Idaho to file a registration statement under the Idaho Corporate Takeover Law which is the subject of the constitutional challenge herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.885" offset="1110915">And it inquired of the States of Maryland and New York as to whether those states would exercise jurisdiction under their respective state takeover laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.149" offset="1155950">Four days later, that Friday, the Deputy Administrator of Securities of the State of Idaho responded to Great Western United requesting additional information under the Idaho filing and contemporaneously, appellant McEldowney, the Director of the Idaho Department of Finance, submitted an executive order -- administrative order delaying the effective date of the tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.260" offset="1268381">No other official from any state, including the appellant Kidwell who has been replaced in office by appellant Leroy, took any action or threatened any action.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.692" offset="1322088">They were merely officials who were charged under their respective state laws with administering those respective state securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.883" offset="1358869">Nor did Great Western United ever attempt to negotiate or respond in part to the request of Idaho for additional information, despite the fact that one of those requests was merely that the eight missing pages from the Xerox copy of the 14D Statement which had been filed with the SCC, be submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.888" offset="1454895">Instead, Great Western United sole response to the request for additional information that was received by them on a Friday was that next Monday morning at 9 o'clock in the morning, to appear in Federal District Court in the Northern District of Texas, Dallas division, seeking an ex parte temporary restraining order in a lawsuit which challenged the constitutionality of the state takeover laws of Idaho, Maryland and New York and asserted that personal jurisdiction and venue were proper over the state officials challenged under the ex parte Young Stripping Doctrine in the Northern District of Texas, rather than in their home states.</text>

            <text syncTime="380.041" offset="1623542">Was the sole basis of this claim of fact that the federal law preempted the Idaho law?</text>

            <text syncTime="387.427" offset="1653112">No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the basis for the constitutional challenge was preemption on the one hand, and on the other hand that the Idaho law and the Maryland and New York law is unduly burdened interstate commerce, and were therefore forbidden on that ground as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="403.810" offset="1718627">I suppose the mere existence of an Idaho statute which might ultimately be determined to preempt -- to be preempted by a federal statute wouldn't mean that the state official charged with administering would be “violating” the federal statute within Section 27?</text>

            <text syncTime="420.184" offset="1784142">Mr. Justice Rehnquist that is exactly our contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.427" offset="1797099">We have a situation here where the officials involved were themselves regulators of securities transactions and are being sought to be held under the jurisdiction and venue portion of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to be subject to suit under that as though they had participated in fraudulent activities, or had in fact violated some direct command of that Securities Exchange Act.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="454.380" offset="1920920">That's one -- on what basis for jurisdiction?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_e_heiser_jr" startTime="456.945" stopTime="739.163">
            <label>Mr. Peter E. Heiser, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="456.945" offset="1931160">That is the federal securities law basis for jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.502" offset="1945370">That is correct Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.656" offset="1954043">The other basis for jurisdiction was the Texas long-arm statute and under the Texas long-arm statute, it was alleged that the Idaho and other officials were actually doing business in Texas, and doing business is a jurisdictional prerequisite in that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.933" offset="2035127">It has a two-step analysis that must be reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.554" offset="2049546">The statute defines two categories of doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.744" offset="2066369">One of those categories, strange as it may seem, is a tort that occurs in whole or in part in Texas, but that is defined in there as doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.671" offset="2106075">The other aspect of doing business in Texas under the Texas long-arm statute that is defined, is a contract, the performance of which occurs all or in part in Texas then the statute opens up the scope and it says that it encompasses other activities that may constitute doing business in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.164" offset="2192071">And it is very much the appellant's contention that their activity in a governmental capacity in being in Idaho, as Idaho officials, charged with an administering Idaho law is certainly not an activity of doing business in Texas with the commercial overtone that that doing business concept necessarily implies.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.058" offset="2295620">That is the threshold consideration that must be reached in the Texas long-arm statute for assertion of personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.268" offset="2320488">The next requirement for inquiry is of course the constitutional due process question.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.845" offset="2346715">International Shoe, Hanson versus Denckla, again phrased in terms of minimum contacts, activities that are commercial profit-oriented activities that would subject a company or organization or person engaged in interstate commerce in a profit-oriented mode to be rightfully subjected to jurisdiction in a place where the consequences of that commercial activity were felt.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.757" offset="2486418">And we submit that the basis of this Court's determinations in due process really relate to the fact that the entity or person subjected to the jurisdiction of the out of state forum has been one who has sought the profit orientation of commercial activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.166" offset="2580041">Never before has it been applied to a state official who is merely a regulator.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.743" offset="2602297">And in fact the mischief of it being applied really relates to a question that was earlier posed this morning by Justice Marshall about being sued in Maui.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.169" offset="2656005">And while it may be nice for a state official to able to vacation in Maui, it certainly is difficult when a state official would be called to defend his action in Idaho in enforcing an Idaho law in Idaho, in Maui or in any other place.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.916" offset="2735000">The chilling effect that that would have on the enforcement of state laws, the chilling effect that that would have on legislatures in determining what law that they passed might be deemed to have somewhere in some other jurisdiction of this United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.833" offset="2794663">An extra territorial effect or consequence would be incredible and the budgetary problems that defending in a foreign jurisdiction present, are also potentially overwhelming.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.572" offset="2853700">The cost of sending attorneys and officials who were hired by their state to represent activities within the state, sending them to foreign jurisdictions to defend actions, the expense of the legislature in a small state, such as Idaho trying to figure appropriations that would cover defenses and jurisdictions throughout the United States of allegations that are brought merely because someone feels they've been affected in a foreign jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.859" offset="2978774">And the expense in many of the federal districts of the United States where a person cannot be admitted directly to practice before that federal district, but must have -- you sometimes can appear pro hac vise with associate counsel, local counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.355" offset="3040841">In other instances, you can not be admitted to practice before the district at all and you must hire a local counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="739.163" offset="3060067">Mr. Heiser, what if this case had arisen with a plaintiff as one who is contending that the takeover should not be permitted because the corporation had not complied with the Idaho statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="751.108" offset="3107819">That plaintiff lived in Texas, otherwise had standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.648" offset="3126000">Is there any reason why in that sort of a lawsuit where their Idaho officials weren't joined as parties, the District Court in Texas couldn't hold that the federal statute preempted the Idaho statute?</text>

            <text syncTime="769.719" offset="3182216">Mr. Justice Rehnquist if it were procedurally proper to entertain the lawsuit in the Northern District of Texas, there is absolutely no reason why the Idaho law could not be assessed as it affected someone in the Northern District of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.548" offset="3241566">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.173" offset="3248044">But that is not what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.678" offset="3254105">Unfortunately, and of course we contend that had this lawsuit been brought in the District of Idaho as it should've been, there would be no question that it is a lawsuit that is properly entertainable in Federal District Court in the District of Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.643" offset="3317948">But unfortunately, it was not brought there and that is what poses the very difficult jurisdiction and venue overlaid this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="833.169" offset="3436022">But you wouldn't go so far as to say that given all the other necessary requirements of federal jurisdiction and venue, only the Federal District Court sitting in Idaho could hold an Idaho statute preempted by a federal statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="846.272" offset="3488475">No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist that is not what I'm -- would not be my contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.573" offset="3505716">Under proper jurisdiction and venue in raising the federal question that would be proper for a federal court to consider the Idaho law or someone else's law.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.686" offset="3562141">And it might -- there might be a situation like that where Idaho would participate as amicus curiae and volunteer to come down.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.737" offset="3598294">I'm not saying that there is a restraint on the court in entertaining the Idaho law.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.117" offset="3615848">In fact I think there's ample Supreme Court precedent for that occurring.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.662" offset="3646046">There has been an allegation made that the State of Idaho delayed the effective date of Great Western's tender offer for the shares of Sunshine Mining Company stock and that it therefore interfered with the transaction of $31 million of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.454" offset="3721174">In fact, the delay attributable to action by Idaho was for a period of two days.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.646" offset="3753984">From March 28 to March 30, 1977 when after hearing that there was an ex parte temporary restraining order sought, we asked the federal district judge in Dallas to allow us to go on the record, and he postponed the hearing for two days.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.471" offset="3817305">All the other delay in this case either resulted as from a lawsuit that was brought by Sunshine Mining Company in the District of Idaho against Great Western United under the Williams Act, charging that Great Western United had not complied with the Williams Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.207" offset="3896195">And the other delay was occasioned by Great Western's desire to pursue in the Northern District of Texas, this constitutional challenge to the Idaho, New York and Maryland takeover statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.990" offset="3963382">We have additionally the venue problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.700" offset="3982190">Venue was alleged under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Section 27 and venue there was sought on the basis that the violations that were alleged to have been committed by the state officials actually occurred in the State of Texas rather than in the State of Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.725" offset="4082291">When in fact the action that did take place was action that was taken in Idaho pursuant to the Idaho law, was transmitted to Texas at the request of Great Western United which had sought the response to be sent to them in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.090" offset="4155747">So it may have come to rest in Texas, but it took place in Idaho and of course creates the awkward situation that if you say that for venue purposes, you have properly a single federal district for venue purposes as the place where the violation occurred, rather than a place were acts in furtherance of a violation occurred, which is not what the venue statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.226" offset="4256266">Then you create this strange situation where if venue is proper in the northern district of Texas, then it can not be proper in the district of Idaho and what you're really challenging is the action of the Idaho officials, the Idaho law and the constitutionality of the Idaho law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1910.768" offset="7746435">The unprecedented decisions below with which you have just been grappling with Mr. Heiser, changed the law with regard to jurisdiction and venue so as to expose the states, their officials and the laws enacted by citizens of this country through their state representatives to unfair trial as occurred in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.503" offset="7829400">There was no reason whatever, none to warp the established procedures to accommodate Great Western United, a multi-state corporation seeking to expand its Idaho operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.504" offset="7881435">Suit in the District Court in Idaho was possible and was convenient for the defendants as we demonstrated in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.294" offset="7912573">The only reason that these problems are presented to Your Honors, that of subject matter jurisdiction under the Securities Act, personal jurisdiction under the Securities Act and the long-arm statute, and the limits on those statutes posed by due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.012" offset="7971401">And the questions of venue not only under the general venue statute of this Court in issues have never been presented before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.652" offset="8005987">And then you wonder the Securities Act, the only reason was that because the lower courts were impatient to exercise their own jurisdiction, the personal jurisdiction of the Northern District Court and the jurisdiction of the Fifth Circuit in order to decide a superficial and intellectual question only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.774" offset="8094490">And that is whether the law of Idaho was preventing shareholders of Sunshine Mining Company, who personally resided in other states, from selling their shares to Great Western United.</text>

            <text syncTime="2059.172" offset="8340041">That's an interesting question to pose to the representative of the Attorney General of New York who sat in our office and debated whether we could take an appeal, because we have to -- had to expend public moneys, and may I say my own profit funds, because the controller didn't think that I was really on state business in Dallas and New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.187" offset="8420080">He thought I was on some frolic in detour for my own amusement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.924" offset="8435022">Also the people who provided us the transcripts have similarly suffered the skepticism of the controller of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.620" offset="8465847">But we determined that we wouldn't burden this Court with yet another jurisdictional problem in a case already bothered, and we chose not to appeal but to appear as amicus throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.815" offset="8510673">Although we feel personally aggrieved, I mean the Attorney General feels personally aggrieved for having to defend his statute in Texas when there was no reason whatever to do so leading aside all of the legal objections in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.085" offset="8583711">In along the way in doing this, we're not only dealing here with statutes that failed to provide jurisdiction and venue over the state officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.902" offset="8630941">But the policy that is reflected by Congress' utter lack of interest in securing this kind of jurisdiction over state officials, is part of the way our Government is organized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.945" offset="8679111">I'm not going to go so far here because it is unnecessary to say that if Congress wrote the kind of statute that Mr. Justice Rehnquist was talking about, it would be unconstitutional, it's the violation of our federal rights we'd first have to see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.976" offset="8731251">Or perhaps unconstitutional as a violation of due process of the individual state officials sued under the doctrine of ex parte Young, as to whether they were given adequate notice that they would be exposed in foreign jurisdictions for their actions in good faith compliance with their own laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="2218.284" offset="8976488">If Congress had done that, and well one of the basic questions, you used the word violate and it has been used here a great many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.024" offset="9007417">It is not conceded and I think it is -- does not do credit to the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.981" offset="9031346">The states are not violators, the language for a state statute which is in conflict with the Williams Act is -- or the many aspect of the securities law is precisely that conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.915" offset="9078993">The word violation does not fairly apprise a state official that what he does is in conflict or in fact if someone sought to sue the official of the Securities Exchange Commission under the same grounds, I don't think he would be given due process notice that he would be exposed to suit as a violator, unless Congress also said a violation means that you act in conflict with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.662" offset="9173974">And then I think if Congress did that securities administrators would know that a new era has come into the United States and state statutes governing securities instead of giving the heavy presumption in favor of them that they are presently given now are to be treated as substantively suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.822" offset="9250670">And without -- and because we have a procedural system that reflects the substantive law of securities regulation in this country, as well as corporate regulation, one can expect that an ordinary state statute which governs the affairs of corporations within that state, actually within that state, and the affairs of securities trading regarding such a corporation, such a statute is presumed correct and is not presumed to be a violation unless Congress held hearings and thought about it a lot and did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.227" offset="9376266">But Congress hasn't threatened us with that nor is there any suggestion that Congress went so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.936" offset="9403120">And all of this -- Your Honors might want to manipulate, as the courts below did, the law to get at the issue if there wasn't a court sitting that could get at the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.747" offset="9442408">But we've conceded from the beginning that there was subject matter jurisdiction under the Supremacy Clause under 1331, and subject matter jurisdiction was available in Idaho.</text>

            <text syncTime="2359.821" offset="9542614">Now, one single decision has a direct precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.344" offset="9556720">Nothing in the finding jurisdiction and venue over the defendant here has a precedent in any previous decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.769" offset="9582425">None of it is required by the language of any statute except by interpretation that is overlaid and is not supported by precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.995" offset="9619310">Just as an example of the most minor aspect of the venue decision of the court below, look what it did to a multi-state corporation doing business all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.869" offset="9658807">Suddenly it can now sue where its board of directors reside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.993" offset="9679391">Even though it's conceded, it was doing business in Idaho and it was its Idaho business that was at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.783" offset="9702484">Suddenly in a federal court, venue now lies for this kind of action in Texas and the court below implies that that's the only place it can lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.002" offset="9743339">That applies not only to actions against state officials but to actions against federal officials and to actions against people who have commercial dealings with Great Western United.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.149" offset="9783986">Indeed when Sunshine Mining sued Great Western under the Williams Act in the District of Idaho following -- or sued Herco, the successor company, after the completion of this tender offer, Great Western United said “Oh no!</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.366" offset="9844799">You got to sue us in the Northern District of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.777" offset="9858487">We have special rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.224" offset="9864234">We can only be sued in the Northern District of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.113" offset="9875832">We now own controlling interest in Sunshine Mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.117" offset="9887848">And your cause of action is about Sunshine Mining Company, but we get sued where we live in Texas.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.029" offset="9915538">This does terrible violence to the system that has been established by for instance, the Texas long-arm statute, and also for instance by Section 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.494" offset="9965380">Nationwide service of process under Section 27 has a purpose and its purpose is to make Great Western United be serviceable where its securities are issued and Sunshine Mining be served where its service is issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.687" offset="10034134">It does not have the purpose of making the officials of Idaho enforcing their own state statute serviceable where their decisions may have an effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.899" offset="10082931">The precedential effect of that kind of decision below is overwhelming.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.640" offset="10101948">And for those of us who represent state officials with regularity, we know that this will change radically the way that states are able to defend themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="2521.185" offset="10188152">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.579" offset="10201736">I represent here the interest of Great Western United Corporation, the appellee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.974" offset="10227231">In March of 1977, as Mr. Heiser has stated, Great Western United Corporation proposed an interstate tender offer for shares of stock of Sunshine Mining Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.791" offset="10286582">Great Western is a Delaware Corporation with its headquarters and principal ownership in Dallas, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.478" offset="10317302">Sunshine Mining Company was and is a Washington corporation with business operations in Idaho, in Maryland and in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.291" offset="10364531">And I mentioned the fact that Sunshine had its place of incorporation in Washington, because Washington had and has no state takeover statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.438" offset="10409148">The shares of Sunshine stock were held by citizens across the nation about 2.5% residing in Idaho, about 6% in Washington, some 7% in Texas and elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.197" offset="10468185">Shares were lifted and traded on the facilities of the national securities marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.141" offset="10495979">Great Western was proposing to pay a premium over the market of $15.75 per share for up to two million of those shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.866" offset="10542791">With that backdrop, Great Western complied in all respects with the provisions of federal law governing the regulation of interstate cash tender offers pursuant to the Williams Act amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.233" offset="10620322">Nevertheless, because Sunshine had operations in these other three states; Idaho, Maryland, and New York and each one of those states had a state takeover statute, Great Western could not make the offer upon filing with the Securities Exchange Commission its Schedule 13D, now a 14D-1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.391" offset="10720946">The Idaho Act, which is typical of state takeover statute, contains and express extra territorial provision which states that no tender offer can be made for shares of a target company, as defined in the Act, anywhere -- that is anywhere in the world to any shareholder, until the Idaho statute has been complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.764" offset="10826480">Now the extra territorial application of that statute combined with the fact that Maryland and New York had similar statutes constitute the most critical facts which permeate all of the issues before this Court to this day.</text>

            <text syncTime="3582.084" offset="14431692">We believe that the Northern District of Texas was the focal point of all of appellant's regulatory activity as well as that of Maryland and New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.195" offset="14468159">Jurisdiction was obtained under the Texas long-arm statute which has been definitively construed by the Texas Supreme Court, in U-Anchor versus Burt, as going to the full limitation of constitutional due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.242" offset="14528345">Judge Dietrich in writing for the Texas Supreme Court on that state issue said that “The construction does not involve and abstruse definitions of what constitutes doing business.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.492" offset="14589367">The United States District Court which heard this case said “The statute has no commercial import.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.889" offset="14630954">Appellants would argue that they were not doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.228" offset="14648299">The statute uses doing business as a pickup to pull in every activity other than what is already specifically described, and as I said goes to the full limits of constitutional due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="3682.796" offset="14834604">We then turn to a minimum contact analysis under the long-arm statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.389" offset="14852890">It seemed to us that the activities of the appellants were certainly purposeful.</text>

            <text syncTime="3710.144" offset="14943901">The cause of action arose directly out of those activities of the Idaho regulators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.816" offset="14974621">The causing of purposeful consequences in a foreign district has been held sufficient under many applications of minimum contact analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.763" offset="15018402">The other avenue which we preceded was Section 27, its interrelationship with Section 28 (a), our view and the courts below that there was a violation or a breach of duty by the enforcement of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.077" offset="15087679">Therefore, minimum contacts analysis was not required because we had from Congress the availability of nationwide service of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.866" offset="15122787">The sovereign United States can exercise in personam jurisdiction over its inhabitants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.745" offset="15146402">It would only be a minimum contact now since required if we've been seeking to sue someone outside of the continental limits of the United States and its territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.316" offset="15188616">Under the Section 27 construction by the lower courts, the act or transaction does not have to be the core of any wrongdoing or even illegal, as long as it's something more than immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.144" offset="15247966">Here, the most material aspect of the Idaho regulation was with -- was happened in Texas, that is the order which enjoined us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.474" offset="15285269">And we would further say that even if a minimum contact or weight of effects analysis were proper under Section 27, it would be satisfied under the same analysis under the Texas long-arm statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="4040.821" offset="16266637">The Williams Act was brought into play in 1968 after Congress had been deliberating the subject for some three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4047.517" offset="16293491">It was not an area which had been regulated before by either states or the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4054.633" offset="16321912">At the time of the adoption of the Williams Act amendments, there was one state takeover statute, Virginia which had been -- had become effective about two months before.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.131" offset="16363917">Congress said it closed the gap in an area which had not been regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.282" offset="16380531">Cash tender offer phenomenon really didn't occur until the mid 60's or maybe early 60's, so this was not an area which had been traditionally state-regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4079.615" offset="16421804">Congress took a market approach allowing the tender offeror to make his filing and go direct to the shareholder at the same time that the incumbent management was going direct to the shareholder to tell their story to let the shareholder make his informed decision about taking cash for his shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="4097.254" offset="16492440">As a result, Congress considered but rejected prior agency approvals, considered but rejected pre-effective filing requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4106.444" offset="16529115">Idaho took exactly the opposite course, and has an extensive hearing and pre-filing requirement which causes the very delay which Congress didn't want to happen because of the weapon it would give to incumbent management, to discourage delay, take defensive maneuvers to defeat a tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4131.524" offset="16629426">Congress also did not seek to have the shareholder decision made by any fiduciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4138.194" offset="16656175">Idaho took the opposite approach where the tender offeror must satisfy either the target management and get their recommendation, or the state regulators.</text>
            <text syncTime="4150.287" offset="16704554">And this particular statute suffers a further vice and that the incumbent management can determine whether the state regulator acts or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.828" offset="16734647">If they accept the offer, state regulator can not call a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4162.648" offset="16753977">If they do accept -- if they set the offer, you can't call a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.520" offset="16769442">If they don't accept the hearing -- the offer, they have to call a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4170.779" offset="16786474">The enforcement of these differing substantive and disclosure provisions between Idaho and the Williams Act and the difference and approaches as found by the majority opinion in the Fifth Circuit and by the United States district judge demonstrates that this tips the balance of regulatory power in favor of the target management, which was not the policy Congress had in mind and the Idaho statute stands as an obstacle to the full accomplishment and execution of congressional purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4207.915" offset="16935058">The preemption analysis was just one of the analysis that the courts below went through, just tells one half of the story.</text>

            <text syncTime="4491.283" offset="18068459">I will -- I'll address the commerce clause first, and then I'll take up the Supremacy Clause arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4497.521" offset="18093432">The point of the Commerce Clause is we think the creation of a common market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4501.561" offset="18109628">It forbids states from Balkanizing the stream of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4505.292" offset="18124570">More than that, it forbids states from reaching outside their borders to affect the flow of commerce elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="4514.042" offset="18159574">Idaho's law affects an interstate market and securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4518.062" offset="18175666">Its laws law applies to securities that are being traded on the New York Stock Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="4522.791" offset="18194578">Its law applies to an offer by somebody residing in Texas to buy shares from somebody else residing in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4530.623" offset="18225821">And the application of this law doesn't simply, as in most commerce clause cases that come to this Court affect local commerce, but produce ripples elsewhere that are felt in other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4541.446" offset="18269184">This is a case in which the very purpose of the state rule is to reach outside the borders of Idaho and tell people in Texas, in New York and Florida whether and when they can buy securities from one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="4554.797" offset="18322578">It's as if the state passed the Blue Sky Law and said “Ordinarily, you can decide not to deal in our state if you decide not to file our state registration statement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4565.585" offset="18365733">But we conclude that in order to protect the residents of Idaho from being eliminated or excluded from valuable opportunities to buy stock, no one can offer stock for sale in Texas unless he files a registration statement and sells it in Idaho as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="4578.676" offset="18418082">Otherwise, our residents are left out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4581.698" offset="18430203">Idaho indeed extols the extra territorial reach of its laws as being justified by just such a purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4589.301" offset="18460609">That kind of justification has been rejected by this Court, we think.</text>
            <text syncTime="4593.521" offset="18477432">Maybe that the best example of that is Baldwin against G.A.F. Seelig, one of the incredible series of New York milk cases that detained this Court for some 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4604.311" offset="18520586">New York tried to increase the selling price of milk in New York by requiring New York wholesalers of milk to treat the wholesale price of milk, even if bought out of state, the same as the New York control price of milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="4617.991" offset="18575339">As the Court analyzed the case, New York was trying to tell buyers and sellers in Vermont what price they should charge for milk if the milk ended up in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="4627.719" offset="18614209">And the fact that the milk ended up in New York produced a very substantial contact with the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="4632.557" offset="18633644">A substantiality of which was not disputed by any one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4636.040" offset="18647542">The milk had contacts with New York, just as Sunshine has substantial contacts with Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="4642.873" offset="18674813">But the Court rejected any notion that New York could attempt to influence the course of commerce in Vermont no matter how much the course of commerce in Vermont might ultimately have an effect on what happened in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="4654.977" offset="18723297">That's exactly what Idaho is trying to do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4656.991" offset="18731342">It's trying to influence the course of conduct in Texas and New York on the ground that that conduct ultimately has repercussions in Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="4665.452" offset="18765197">And the statute fails for the same reason, we think.</text>
            <text syncTime="4669.575" offset="18781706">But even if the statute were treated as one that applied wholly to a state's domestic commerce and merely produced its ripples elsewhere, it would be invalid because the ripples are great and the justifications for the act small.</text>
            <text syncTime="4683.815" offset="18838653">Idaho argues for example that it has the goal of protecting Idaho shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="4689.881" offset="18862895">One of the anomalies of the statute though is that it has -- it's not triggered by the presence of any shareholder in Idaho, would apply if there were no shareholder in Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.349" offset="18900720">On the other hand, the statute does not apply if the takeover offer is consented to by the management of the company, even if the management of the company is found in Washington State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4708.989" offset="18939277">And so in those cases, Idaho shareholders receive no protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4713.648" offset="18957981">What's more is that what Idaho tries to do in a case like this, is protect the 2% of the shareholders who live in Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="4721.171" offset="18988074">Only be requiring the 98% of the shareholders who live in New York and Texas and Florida to forego what they may find to be a valuable opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4730.799" offset="19026526">The only other justification advanced by the state is that its statute will protect civic-minded businesses, or local commerce, health and safety and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="4742.263" offset="19072397">That amounts to, we think, discrimination against interstate commerce for its own purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4746.702" offset="19090160">It's an exaltation of the values of local isolationism from the stream of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4752.101" offset="19111790">And that's the kind of justification that was rejected in Philadelphia against New Jersey last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="4760.201" offset="19144182">The point of this argument has been that Idaho has had substantial extra territorial intent, in fact in scope of its statute, those kinds of things that ought to be regulated by Congress, if they're regulated at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4775.398" offset="19204995">In fact, Congress has regulated them and that brings me to the point under the supremacy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4782.272" offset="19232475">In order to evaluate the argument which we make here that the state law is preempted by the Williams Act, its necessary first we think to understand why people make tender offers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4795.903" offset="19287019">Tender offer is a public offer to buy shares at more than they will fetch in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4802.139" offset="19311888">A person ordinarily makes such an offer only if he's persuaded that the shares will be worth more in his hands than they are worth held and distributed to the public at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="4814.811" offset="19362565">That may be because incumbent management is inefficient and mismanaging the company, and that event, the value of the shares will increase if new management is substituted by the offeror.</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.555" offset="19409586">Maybe the tax considerations would make the shares more valuable in some hands than others if for example the target has some operating loss carryovers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4835.414" offset="19445008">Whatever the reason, and there may be many, the offeror is relying on an increment in value.</text>
            <text syncTime="4841.522" offset="19469458">The problem is that it's very costly for firms to go out and identify such cases where there may be an increment in value, and they don't accept those costs unless there's some prospect of return.</text>
            <text syncTime="4854.714" offset="19522226">And the prospect of return has to be discounted by the risk that the offer will be a failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.143" offset="19539989">The greater the risk, the more return there has to be to make the offer worthwhile.</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.142" offset="19559946">But in order to realize the gain that he's identified, the offeror has to make the public offer and pay more than the shares bring in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4872.436" offset="19593070">Not too much more though, and this is the difficulty from the offeror's point of view, because if he offers the entire increment of profit to the current shareholders, the highest possible price, there's nothing left for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4884.778" offset="19642493">No incentive to do the searching.</text>
            <text syncTime="4886.126" offset="19647927">No incentive to make the offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4889.218" offset="19660257">And without an offer of course, shareholders will get nothing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4892.210" offset="19672168">So the closer any rule tries to drive the price, to the maximum price, to what its worth to the offeror, the less likely the offer is to occur in the first place, the more likely the shareholder is to end up with nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4907.158" offset="19732041">Time is of the essence in the tender offer process, and so is the opportunity to have a fair fight between the offeror and the incumbent management.</text>
            <text syncTime="4917.716" offset="19774255">It's most likely that the incumbent management feels its own personal prerequisites and position at stake.</text>

            <text syncTime="4952.203" offset="19912182">The -- that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4954.199" offset="19920123">The difficulty lies in determining how that judgment is going to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4959.016" offset="19939453">One can construct the set of rules, there's going to be an offer there's going to be a response by the target management.</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.672" offset="19966098">One can construct a set of rules under which someone, usually the shareholders have to make up his mind whether to the offer is beneficial or not, whether there is that incremented value.</text>
            <text syncTime="4975.629" offset="20005909">And the Williams Act was an attempt to set up that set of rules under which shareholders could make that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4982.545" offset="20033599">The prorative provisions, the seven-day withdrawal provisions, the disclosure provisions were intended to allow shareholders to make that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4992.582" offset="20073723">But it was a judgment that was to be made in the context of information from both offeror and the target management, the ultimate decision to be decision to be made by the shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="5003.273" offset="20116459">The difficulty in regulating in that way is to set up a system of regulations so that the shareholder can make that choice, without at the same time so setting up regulatory rules that the number of beneficial tender offers is reduced and there are fewer opportunities for shareholders to make their judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="5022.453" offset="20193155">Congress' assessment was that the best combination of protection for shareholders and insurance that tender offers would not be eliminated all together, was a set of disclosure rules coupled with prompt start of the offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.302" offset="20260551">And Congress explicitly considered and just as explicitly rejected a variety of pre-offer notification rules or a variety of rules of the sort that would require the Securities and Exchange Commission to pass on the adequacy of disclosure before the tender offer could begin.</text>
            <text syncTime="5058.053" offset="20335574">But given the necessity of making the kind of balance, actually a rather fine tuned one that Congress had in mind in the Williams Act, it must follow we think that a state can not use the very devices that Congress rejected as detrimental to the interests of investors, because then the state defeats precisely what it was that Congress had in mind to achieve.</text>
            <text syncTime="5080.275" offset="20424495">Idaho simply is not free to strike a different balance on how best to achieve that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5086.061" offset="20447587">Congress recognized however that what it said in the Williams Act was not the last word.</text>
            <text syncTime="5092.188" offset="20472142">And it gave the Securities and Exchange Commission a substantial rule-making power.</text>
            <text syncTime="5096.639" offset="20489906">In fact, almost every one of the provisions of the Williams Act is coupled with the grant of rule-making power that the Commission to alter it to change it in some way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5106.658" offset="20530030">In entrusting that rule-making task, the fine tuning task, to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Congress set up a system of regulation that is very closely related in concept to the system this Court considered last year in Ray against ARCO, the Washington Super Tanker case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5123.862" offset="20598784">In Ray, the Secretary of Transportation had decided not to set up a rule under which Super Tanker is -- were forbidden to enter Puget Sound, and had decided not to use his rule-making powers, although he surely had them, to set up a rule requiring double bottoms, twin screws and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="5141.628" offset="20669837">Washington then required those things and gave as a rationale the argument that it was simply increasing protection of the environment, the very thing Congress had in mind in passing its statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5151.875" offset="20710902">And it wanted to view that congressional statute and the secretary's regulations as minimum guarantees of environmental safety with the state adding additional guarantees of environmental safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="5164.517" offset="20761475">This Court rejected that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5166.741" offset="20770356">The reason it rejected it is because the secretary of the treasury had the same power to assess and weigh the benefits of safety against the convenience of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5177.686" offset="20814137">And it said that the state could not add where the secretary had said there should not be additional protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="5184.473" offset="20841305">And that's really the same set up as works under the Williams Act, the Commission is free to provide additional period to increase the length during which a tender offer may be open.</text>
            <text syncTime="5193.791" offset="20878503">It's free to promulgate a great number of other regulations that will have the effect of assessing the benefit to investor against whatever detriment to commerce may be caused.</text>
            <text syncTime="5206.495" offset="20929390">And it's because the Commission has that authority and because it has decided to exercise it in a way that does not provide the kinds of things that Idaho has provided, the Idaho statute is preempted, we submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5219.456" offset="20981217">And therefore, under both the Supremacy Clause and the Commerce Clause, if the Court reaches the merits here, we submit that it should affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="5263.419" offset="21157073">The position under the Commerce Cause allows states substantial authority to regulate within the state for the same reason that in Hall against Geiger-Jones, the Commerce Clause permitted Blue Sky Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="5275.143" offset="21203989">On top of that, I think it's important to point out that the Commission does not argue that all state laws touching on takeovers are preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5284.891" offset="21242964">For example, a state law requiring any statements by offeror or management to be fair, adequate and so on, similar to or tracking federal law could be enforced and on --</text>

            <text syncTime="5320.218" offset="21384234">But it's -- but I think it's important to point out, and I'm -- I think it should be clear that in the Commission's view there are a number of possible state statutes that would not disrupt the balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5332.969" offset="21435225">Take for example a state statute that says any corporation incorporated in this state shall respond to tender offers only by two-thirds vote of the board of directors, or any of the other things regulating that the affairs between the corporation and its shareholders would in most cases not be preempted by the Williams Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5355.343" offset="21524773">That the test is not simply does it touch tender offers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5358.565" offset="21537625">We're not making a field preemption argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5361.457" offset="21549223">The test is whether it upsets or undermines the careful balancing that Congress has done of the -- and its assessment of where the interest of investors lie.</text>

            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="5371.736" offset="21590288">Would it make a difference if the state statute is limited to corporations incorporated under the laws of that state?</text>

            <text syncTime="5379.698" offset="21622157">I think that would substantially reduce the opportunities for disrupting the balance that's been created by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5387.085" offset="21651728">The difficulties in allowing a state to regulate even those offers that are made with some citizens might arise if for example New York, where 35% of shareholders lie, has a statute saying you must do A.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.230" offset="21708257">California where there're another 30% has a statute saying you can't do A, and each tries to tug the balance in a slightly different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5409.055" offset="21739604">The opportunities for that when more than one state can enter the picture or one tender offer are really quite substantial, and it's for that reason that the Commission says that even as applied to shareholders within the state, the Acts are in many cases preempted by the Williams Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="5461.241" offset="21948374">The one of the frustrations that the Idaho appellants have in this case is that the Securities Exchange Commission where it had a real opportunity to provide enlightenment for this Court as to what Section 27 really involves and what Section 28 conflict may mean in their terms ignored those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="5481.273" offset="22028413">And like the courts below, because of the fascination of the merits, which certainly are fascinating left right into the constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5491.292" offset="22068537">But unfortunately in doing that they used some of the clichés and terms that have been used all along with regard to these state laws which have had a salutary effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5503.248" offset="22116394">Talk about the term delays, state laws have prolonged the period during which tender offers are open.</text>
            <text syncTime="5509.833" offset="22142725">The net result of that has been in the period between 1974 and 1976, a $1.2 billion premium to the shareholders as a result of that extended period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5522.213" offset="22192253">But the point that we really have focused here is that we have a Texas corporation that wanted to take over a controlling interest in a corporation that was subject to jurisdiction under the Idaho Corporate Takeover Law, and the Texas Corporation, the corporation with operations in Texas knew and recognized that Idaho law was going to have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5552.150" offset="22311999">They came to Idaho to submit themselves to the jurisdiction of that Idaho law, and then when they didn't get the immediate approval that they wanted, their reaction to test the constitutionality of the Idaho law was down in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5570.017" offset="22383470">And that is unfortunately what creates the problem in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5576.396" offset="22408965">We shouldn't be having to be concerned about defending the action in Texas because it shouldn't have been brought in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5585.242" offset="22444387">It should have been brought in Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="5587.018" offset="22451493">And if a corporation like Great Western United wants to do, as it does, business in many states, then it should be prepared to conform to the problems that it may be presented with by the laws of those states.</text>
            <text syncTime="5602.227" offset="22512306">And if it has constitutional challenges to the laws of those states, it is perfectly free to go into the federal courts in those states or the state courts in those states and raise those constitutional challenges.</text>

            <text syncTime="5615.958" offset="22567163">By the same token of course, the respondent company says that what Idaho did had a direct impact upon what the respondent wanted to do in the State of Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="5636.118" offset="22647829">And under the rationale advanced by the courts below then because of the effect in all of the other 49 states, they more than likely could've brought suit in any of the other 49 states, and we could've been defending an action in Vermont or Hawaii or Alaska or Florida as well as Texas because Great Western United wanted to secure shares of stock from shareholders in those states.</text>
            <text syncTime="5659.068" offset="22739675">So the problem becomes the forum shopping problem and that really is not what we feel the federal law was designed for, and it's certainly isn't what we feel that the Texas long-arm statute and the accompanying federal venue statute were designed for.</text>
            <text syncTime="5675.523" offset="22805504">That's the whole point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5677.659" offset="22813968">The U-Anchor case that the Texas Supreme Court recently brought or recently decided that construe the Texas long-arm statute, it is absolutely true that they said that the Texas long-arm statute goes to the full limits of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="5691.284" offset="22868511">But what was the context of the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="5693.181" offset="22876139">A contract, one of the specifically defined terms that constitutes doing business under the Texas long-arm statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5703.462" offset="22917204">The threshold first level of inquiry under the Texas long-arm statute was satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="5708.630" offset="22937893">So they didn't have to waste time on deciding whether it was an act of doing business in Texas, because it fell within the actual definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5717.130" offset="22971852">But what the Court did do in U-Anchor was finding that yes, it technically, the facts technically satisfy our jurisdictional prerequisite in the Texas long-arm statute as a doing business context -- I see I'm out of time.</text>
