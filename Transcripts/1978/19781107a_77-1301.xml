            <text syncTime="3536.726" offset="14251321">And without an impartial jury, any other right granted to an accused is meaningless.</text>

            <text syncTime="3563.535" offset="14358528">To further protect the rights of an accused, our society extends reasonable doubt and presumption of innocence and other burdens in favor of an accused.</text>
