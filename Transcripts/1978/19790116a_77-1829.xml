            <text syncTime="498.937" offset="2100099">The double-bunking issue, the disposition in the Court of Appeals was that it reversed the District Court's ban as applied to sentenced inmates and remanded for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.404" offset="2145970">It affirmed as applied to pretrial detainees because it perceived that a different legal standard was appropriate to judge the claim in that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.927" offset="2184108">There are also four rules or practices that are before this Court that are justified on security grounds, the right to receive packages, the so called publisher only rule, the validity of visual inspection of body cavities after contact visits and the right to be present or the inmate to present and observe room searches.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="545.627" offset="2286926">With the exception of the room search issue which applies only to pretrial detainees, no distinction was drawn on the other three issues between sentenced inmates and pretrial detainees, arguably one might be but none has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.957" offset="2348262">Now these five issues are the rump contingent of a veritable army of complaints about the operation of the MCC that marched into the United States District Court in November 1975, less than four months after the MCC opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.425" offset="2414090">The issues raised covered such diverse subjects as housing, food, clothing of inmates, visiting, library facilities, staffing, educational and job opportunities, grievance procedures, mail, telephone service, noise levels, various aspects of the treatment of personal property and many others, they're numerous to name here.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.950" offset="2500190">After initially resolving a few of the issues on summary judgment including the double-bunking and the publisher only issue, the District Court conducted hearings and issued an extensive opinion granting much of the relief respondents sought and denying others of their claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.245" offset="2565392">The court relied on both constitutional and statutory grounds for its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.643" offset="2586917">Some of its rulings, the government acquiesced and others were appealed to the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals in turn affirmed in part and reversed in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.258" offset="2637385">It rejected any statutory basis for the District Court's orders prohibiting various MCC practices and conditions, finding that the case generally involved matters committed to agency discretion by law, and accordingly rested it's own ruling solely on constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.531" offset="2706557">And as I've said in setting forth the constitutional standards that distinguish between sentenced inmates and pretrial detainees.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.236" offset="2741352">As to the former challenged conditions were to be judged by the Eighth Amendment, Cruel and Unusual Punishment Standard, the detainees -- the Court relied on the presumption of innocence to set a much higher standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.664" offset="2795060">It stated that pretrial detainees maybe subject to “Only those restrictions and privations which inhere in their confinement itself or which are justified by compelling necessities of jail administration.”</text>
            <text syncTime="688.130" offset="2856918">And it made quite clear that challenges to conditions of confinement for detainees are to be adjudicated without consideration of either physical or administrative justifications for the particular practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.480" offset="2914283">It applied these standards for the double-bunking issue by in affect adopting a per se rule that two inmates may not be housed in the room designed for one.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.867" offset="2955870">With regard to the other issues that are before this Court, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that the maintenance of security and order is a compelling necessity of jail administration, but it nevertheless concluded that the government had failed to establish sufficient justification for the practices or rules in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.604" offset="3038835">Now as I indicated at the beginning the case breaks down into two different types of issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.170" offset="3057121">The first involves the standards by which the due process rights of pretrial detainees are to be evaluated in the context of a challenged or alleged overcrowding at the MCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.933" offset="3100170">The second involves the security related issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.379" offset="3113963">Now since the first issue was potentially the more novel and substantial constitutional issue, I intend to devote most or all of my limited time to that question and to rely on the briefs for the other issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.405" offset="3174045">I'd like to say a brief word about the MCC itself before getting into legal arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.571" offset="3198704">It is one of a very limited number of Federal facilities, specifically designed to house pretrial detainees and other short-term inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.351" offset="3233813">As the Court of Appeals described that the MCC represented the architectural embodiment of the best and most progressive penological planning.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.498" offset="3270384">The key design element of the MCC that's relevant to the double-bunking issue and that indeed is the central element of the facility, is the modular unit concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.221" offset="3329317">In this concept there are self contained residential units in lieu of the traditional cell block.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.102" offset="3352827">Typical unit contains 48 rooms, which would join large multipurpose rooms with facilities for recreation, education, exercise, and dining.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.170" offset="3393055">The common areas are carpeted, sleeping rooms have doors rather than bars and for the virtually the entire day except seven sleeping hours between 11 in night and 6 in the morning the inmates are free to move about their unit without restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.898" offset="3460033">Also visiting facilities are attached to each of these units rather than having a central facility for the institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.191" offset="3493157">I understand that there are slides in the record with photographs of the institution if you deem it useful to get a look at what it's like.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.021" offset="3548432">The MCC was designed to house 449 inmates, however contemporaneous with its opening in August 1975, there was a sharp and unexpected increase in the number of persons committed to the Bureau of Prisoners Custody, who the Bureau determined had to be or should be housed at the MCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.938" offset="3628157">Because the number of inmates exceeded the designed capacity of the institution, the Bureau determined in order to meet its custodial obligations that a number of the rooms should be used to house two inmates and that bunk bed should replace single beds in the dormitory areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.689" offset="3699106">Accordingly, bunk beds were installed in place of single beds in 73 of the 389 residential rooms at the MCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.882" offset="3739961">Now the respondents have invoked and the Court of Appeals has relied upon the Due Process Clause for striking down the double bunking in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.205" offset="3781235">The focus of the issue therefore concerns the substantive content of that clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.840" offset="3807775">The Court of Appeals held that the Due Process Clause by its own force and without the aid of any other constitutional provision, confers upon pretrial detainees the right to be free of cramped housing conditions in the absence of a governmental showing of compelling necessity.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="946.086" offset="3888755">I believe they viewed it as a liberty interest and we do not dispute in this case the pretrial detainees retain those liberty interests that are not inconsistent with the fact of confinement itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.858" offset="3963779">We simply dispute that the standard that was applied by the Court of Appeals in evaluating the practices that arguably impinged upon those liberty interests was the right standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.164" offset="4017068">Now we think that the Court of Appeals Standard lacks any basis in the constitutional decisions of this Court dealing with the subject of substantive due process and we think that the proper resolution of the issue that was before the Court of Appeals required that the government be afforded an opportunity to adduce the factors that brought about the challenged conditions and the propriety of the government's action having to be assessed by its reasonableness in relation to the legitimate governmental objectives at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.285" offset="4165548">Now two aspects of the constitutional backdrop to this issue are worth highlighting. First, there is no dispute that the conditions of confinement for both pretrial detainees and sentenced inmates must meet minimum levels of decency with regard to such consideration as housing, food, sanitation, and medical care and we have spelled out in our brief the reasons for our contention that these standards have been fully satisfied at the MCC.</text>

            <text syncTime="1365.646" offset="5566966">Well, let me explain the role that I think punishment properly plays in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.669" offset="5587028">When a challenge is presented to a condition of confinement, the government is obliged assuming the challenge crosses some constitutional threshold of presenting some kind of claim of liberty interest, the government is obliged to show in some fashion and by some standard a justification for the action that it has taken, which has impaired this interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.347" offset="5681800">Now the -- in the case of a pretrial detainee, the government cannot say, one of the reasons we're doing this is to punish them; or one of the reasons that justifies this practice is to rehabilitate them, or to deter others from committing the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.902" offset="5743971">Those are -- those are governmental objectives that can only be invoked to support a condition of confinement in the case of convicted inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.427" offset="5786081">In the case of pretrial detainees, there must be other kinds of considerations invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.221" offset="5821294">Our concern in this case is that the very real and substantial physical and administrative considerations that made it necessary to resort to a degree of double-bunking were totally foreclosed from consideration by the Court under a standard which in effect said per se, “You just can't put two people in a room that was designed for one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.352" offset="5905826">We don't want to hear why you're doing it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.133" offset="5916902">Now in this connection there is a lot of suggestion that physical considerations and administrative convenience are some how insubstantial excuses that the government makes up to justify its practices, and that it's something -- administrative convenience is something like not having to work overtime or not having to make modifications and establish routines and we think administrate convenience is much more in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.618" offset="6066845">The Bureau of Prisons has as a certain population of inmates committed to its custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.165" offset="6089101">It has no control over the number of these inmates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1593.304" offset="6477594">Furthermore the government misconstrues the Second Circuit's test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.704" offset="6495253">What we are dealing with here is the fundamental right of a pretrial detainee not to be punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.054" offset="6524615">This right persists even though the pretrial detainee is placed in custody to assure his appearance in court at the time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.323" offset="6565679">This fact of detention has not constitutionally been considered punishment, because the Eighth Amendment permits bail and by inference permits custody in lieu of bail in order to assure the appearance of the defendant for trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3406.985" offset="13732321">First of all with regard to the testimony of government experts in other cases about the amount of space that's necessary, the other case was a case that involved a cell in which people were locked for substantial portions of the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.109" offset="13804837">The central to the concept of the MCC and if there is repeating that people are not locked into their rooms except during sleeping hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.616" offset="13842871">So the inconveniences that we are talking about in this case of two people being in cramped quarters and we don't deny that the quarters are cramped, is an inconvenience in terms of forced togetherness that exist for a period of relatively brief period and in fact none of, essentially none of the waking hours except when there were certain times when everybody has to go to their rooms for a cell count.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.175" offset="13957078">Now there was no hearing in this case, not only to hear the government's justifications for resorting to double-bunking, but also no hearing to examine the effect of double-bunking on the inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.401" offset="14017996">The only evidence that was before the District Court in this case was affidavit of the government psychiatrist who had examined the facility and who concluded that there was no substantial evidence that this was emotionally detrimental under the conditions that existed at the MCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.635" offset="14090930">Now the response to this is on the part of both the District Court and the Court of Appeals in large part was we already settled this in another case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.301" offset="14133561">The other case in which they already settled it and the Court of Appeals made a revealing error in their original opinion, at page 18 A of the Appendix, they stated “Inmate testimony revealed that double celling had produced numerous disagreements over the choice of activities within the room, had spawned fights, charges of theft, frequent involuntary contact,” that was testimony as they later amended the opinion in another case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.430" offset="14254143">The other case was a case in which there were 40 square feet for two inmates instead of 76 or 77 as in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.571" offset="14282668">The other case was a case in which the inmates were locked in their room for approximately twice the time that they were in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.802" offset="14311612">The other case was the conventional cell block kind of jail.</text>

            <text syncTime="3566.189" offset="14369186">The District Court went to the jail, visited it and said as, as people have been known to say about obscenity, it's unconstitutional I know when I see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.395" offset="14426028">This we consider to be an unsatisfactory way of dealing with this issue and I would like at this point to get back to the question of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.370" offset="14461868">One thing that's very important you ask why are we inquiring into physical and administrative reasons for the double-bunking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.161" offset="14489036">Nobody in the lower courts has based any decision on the grounds of what happened here was punishment, that was not the basis of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.846" offset="14519756">That is the argument of the respondents in an effort to surmount the lack of authority to support the Court of Appeals' conclusion that a compelling necessity standard was appropriate to judge the restriction on the liberty of the inmates that was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.844" offset="14587779">The Court of Appeals did not say this was punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.741" offset="14599377">Now, they say it's punishment, but they do not analyze the concept in the way this Court has analyzed it, that is they do not look to the standards in Mendoza-Martinez that suggest how you go about the inquiry of determining whether or not something is punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.947" offset="14664161">And we think if you apply that inquiry in this case, you would not conclude that what happened here was punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.416" offset="14686104">So I come back to the point that, Your Honor --</text>
