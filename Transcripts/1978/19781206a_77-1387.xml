            <text syncTime="39.961" offset="263189">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.924" offset="279071">This case arises under the Freedom of Information Act, but unlike the other cases this court has considered involving the Act, here the government is not contending that certain agency documents are not disclosable to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.611" offset="337795">Well, we are contending is that the Act grants the District Court discretion in an appropriate case to delay the public release of agency documents for a reasonable period of time, just like in civil discovery, where the immediate of those documents would prevent or impair the effectuation of an important governmental policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.031" offset="423476">We also contend of course that this is an appropriate case for the exercise of that discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.503" offset="445419">And the particular documents and agency involved here are the so called Domestic Policy Directives.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="91.033" offset="467466">Let me ask you a question Mr. Geller about the discretion contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.540" offset="489514">Here the District Court simply required the production of the documents.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="101.022" stopTime="102.792">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="101.022" offset="507486">Yes.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="102.792" offset="514591">So I take it your contention is that the discretion could only be exercised in one way in this particular case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="109.507" stopTime="143.301">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="109.507" offset="541445">No, the District Court took the position that it had no discretion, because the Act required immediate disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.353" offset="564746">It viewed the Act does not allowing it to weigh the interests of the government in a temporary withholding of the documents against the interest of the public in gaining immediate access to those documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.974" offset="611244">It’s our position that the Act does grant the District Court that discretion, and indeed we assume that if this Court adopts that submission, the appropriate disposition would be a remand to the District Court for determination whether to exercise that discretion in this case.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>

            <text syncTime="145.885" offset="686895">No, we do, we claim that it falls clearly within Exemption 5 and we construe Exemption 5 to a Court at District Court discretion as I have said in an appropriate case to decide whether or not to release otherwise disclosable documents where the government is made a showing of harm from the immediate release.</text>

            <text syncTime="171.965" offset="791280">The section that you are dealing with the exemptions beginning this section does not apply to matters that are, and then 5 says inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than the agency and litigation with the agency.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="191.685" stopTime="224.971">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="191.685" offset="870066">We believe it comes from the language would not be available to a party in litigation with the agency, which we think what Congress intended was to mirror the practice under civil discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.030" offset="911444">I think this Court is held that on several occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.013" offset="919385">Now I hope to get to that a little later in the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.108" offset="927848">And of course, since civil discovery the court would get engage frequently in a balancing process when it’s not dealing with documents that are subject to an absolute privilege or documents not subject to any privilege whatsoever, there is a whole middle ground in which you has to weigh the competing interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.806" offset="986572">We claim that the same analysis should apply under the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="224.971" stopTime="229.252">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="224.971" offset="1003290">Mr. Geller, why we have to interrupt it, there is a stay order still in effect.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="229.252" stopTime="452.068">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="229.252" offset="1020426">The stay order is still in effect, that’s correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.401" offset="1036936">Now before turning to the specific FOIA exemption that we claim is applicable in this case, which is Exemption 5, I’d like begin by briefly explaining the importance of the open market committees policy functions, how the domestic policy directives relate to those functions and why the premature release of these sensitive documents would severely frustrate implementation of the committee’s policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.637" offset="1133902">Federal Reserve System is of course the nation’s central bank, and it helps to achieve the country’s economic goals through its influence on monitory policy that is the availability and cost of bank reserves, bank credit and money.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.705" offset="1194193">System essentially has three main goals and three main tools with which to accomplish these goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.435" offset="1221151">First is the setting of the discount rate, which is the rate that charge member banks on borrowing from the regional Federal Reserve Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.319" offset="1256678">The second tool is the Board’s power to change reserve requirements that is the percentage of reserves that member banks must hold in back of deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.303" offset="1300564">The finally monitory tool of the system and the one that concern us here today is the power to engage and so called open market operations, that is the purchase or sale of large amounts of securities, principally United States Government Securities in the open market.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.885" offset="1370885">Simply stated, when the Federal Reserve System buy securities, it increases the total volume of bank reserves, because the Fed’s payment for the securities is ordinarily deposited in the seller’s bank account and it’s credited to that bank’s reserve account in its regional reserve bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.467" offset="1449253">Conversely, when the system sells securities, the sales price typically is deducted from the reserve account of the buyer’s bank, and this decreases the volume of reserves held by that bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.653" offset="1497945">Now these changes in the volume of the bank reserves obviously influence the ability of these banks to make loans and investments, which in turn has a substantial effect on the availability of money and the level of interest rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.210" offset="1552175">The open market operations tool is by far the Federal Reserve System’s most important monitory policy instrument.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.238" offset="1588328">Open market operations are extremely flexible unlike the other tools that I’ve mentioned and they need to be used to the extent and only to the extent necessary to accomplish the system short or long-term monitory policy goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.991" offset="1647365">As a result, while the discount rate and reserve appointments are changed only occasionally, the Fed enters the market on virtually every business today and either buys or sells millions of dollars worth of securities depending upon what monitory goal it’s trying to accomplish.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.389" offset="1716955">Now the organ of the Federal Reserve System that’s responsible for directing these open market operations is the petitioner in this case, the Federal Open Market Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.794" offset="1754572">Committee is composed of 12 members, the 7 Governors of the Federal Reserve board and 5 representatives of the Regional Reserve Banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.846" offset="1786755">Committee meets approximately once a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.557" offset="1797622">Its meetings begin with a run down of general economic developments and a consideration of what economic developments might arise in the immediate future.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.402" offset="1837014">At the end of the meeting, the system decides what its plans for the open market operations in the upcoming month should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.076" offset="1867630">These plans are embodied in the domestic policy directive, the subject of this litigation, which is adopted by the open market committee at the conclusion of its monthly meeting.</text>

            <text syncTime="458.990" offset="1939310">During the one month period that the domestic policy directive is in effect, only employees of the Federal Reserve System with the need of access to that directive have access to that directive, which would be the Account Manager who actually does the buying and selling of the open market – of securities in the open market.</text>

          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="479.981" stopTime="575.176">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="479.981" offset="2023320">I would say it’s just a handful of people and generally high officials of the Federal Reserve System.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.342" offset="2056756">It’s a very small number of people that have actual access to domestic policy directive during the one month of its effectiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.045" offset="2091551">Now the directive takes the form of instructions to the system’s Account Manager in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.593" offset="2121749">He is an official of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and he does the actual buying and selling of the securities in the open market.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.411" offset="2149021">These instructions state what the Federal Open Market Committee’s general monitory policy goals for the upcoming month are and what’s more important; the directive also specifically notes what the committee’s objectives are for the rate of growth of the nation’s money supply and what the permissible fluctuation of the so called Federal Funds Rate in the upcoming months is according to the committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.680" offset="2246092">The Federal Funds Rate is the interest rate that member banks charge each other for overnight loans and it’s an extremely sensitive of an accurate parameter of tightness or ease in the economy in regard to the availability of the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.588" offset="2309726">The Account Manager begins to implement the directive immediately upon its adoption.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.663" offset="2334072">The committee has always kept these domestic policy directives confidential during the one month period of their effectiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.437" offset="2365106">The current practice is to delay disclosure of the directive until a few days following the next month’s committee meeting.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="575.176" stopTime="586.722">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="575.176" offset="2404080">Mr. Geller, do you think that knowledgeable observers of the market reactions will know what‘s going on after a few days however when the Fed gets into the market?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="586.722" stopTime="849.934">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="586.722" offset="2450265">I don’t think so, they can make -- knowledgeable market observers can make educated guesses based upon the Account Manager’s buying or selling of securities in the open market on a daily basis, but there is a certain level of uncertainty that attaches to their observations.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.819" offset="2514631">This uncertainty that wouldn’t exist if the directive was made public, and that uncertainty is very important because it dampens the economic activity and it prevents these market observers from entering the market in a major way.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.416" offset="2569070">But more important, I don’t think they’re just looking at the Account Manager’s daily buying or selling would give you an accurate picture of what the directive is likely to be, because most of Account Manager’s daily buying or selling may not pursuant to the directive.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.762" offset="2630405">In other words, it may not be for the purpose of accomplishing the goals set forth in the directive; it may be simply a response to something that’s happened that day in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.205" offset="2668231">Let me give an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.627" offset="2677844">Let’s assume that for a number of reasons there is a temporary glut of money in the market and may be because of the changes in treasury balances at the Federal Reserve Banks or because of the float.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.852" offset="2722774">There is more money in the market than the Fed expected.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.184" offset="2744090">Now when that happens, interest rates might be expected to drop, because more money is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.443" offset="2773138">The Account Manager seeing these developments might well decide to sell securities; in other words, to take money out of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.394" offset="2808978">Now, this would not be for the purpose of raising interest rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.847" offset="2822771">It would be merely to keep interest rates constant in a situation in which they might otherwise drop, so that if someone merely looked at what the Account Manager did in the market that day which is to sell large amounts of securities; he might get the impression that the directive is telling the Account Manager to attempt to raise interest rates whereas that wouldn’t be an accurate picture, the Account Manger is merely attempting to meet developments that have occurred in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.180" offset="2928097">Now as I was saying, the directive is kept secret until a few days following the next month’s meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.296" offset="2956518">At that point, the directive for the month just ended is made available to the public and it’s published in the federal register.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.761" offset="2986402">That’s for example; the domestic policy directive adopted at the committee’s meeting on October 17th 1978, was released to the press on November 24th 1978, and was sent to the federal register on November 29th 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.195" offset="3052126">Primary reason for this delay in publication has always been the committee’s concern that advance public notice of its open market policy decisions would create excessive reactions or other disturbances in the securities market that would interfere with the committee’s ability to implement its open market decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.782" offset="3130493">There would be a so called announcement effect as market participants attempted to realize financial gains in anticipation of the committee’s purchases or sales of securities in the upcoming month.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.796" offset="3178559">Now this is spelled out a greater length in our brief and in the affidavits made to the District Court, but let me give it quick just one example.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.220" offset="3212204">The Federal Open Market Committee each month buys or sells literally billions of dollars worth of government securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.812" offset="3246582">Let’s assume that it was known that in the month to follow, the committee intended to attempt to raise the federal funds rate, which as I said is the interest rate at which banks lend money to each other on an overnight basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.734" offset="3294333">Market investors could reasonably assume if they had access to this directive, that to raise the federal funds rate, the committee would seek to decrease the available reserves, which would mean that the Fed would be engaging in the sale of large amounts of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.354" offset="3360789">On with this knowledge, it’s likely that many investors would react immediately by also selling government securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.071" offset="3391613">And this would tend to depress securities’ prices and to inflate interest rates unnaturally.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.700" offset="3414183">So I have explained in our brief these sudden movements in securities’ prices and interest rates might be larger than the committee contemplated, and might even be beyond the ability of the committee to control on occasion, but the very least, these market reactions would make it immeasurably harder for the committee to accomplish gradually what it set out to do that month.</text>

            <text syncTime="1281.988" offset="5231365">Prior to the passage of the FOIA, a number of federal agencies complaint to Congress that their policy decisions could be adversely affected, not only by the release of pre-decisional materials, but also by the premature release of the final agency decisions themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.815" offset="5294582">For instance, one example that was given by the Defense Department and the General Services Administration is that those agencies on occasion issue instructions to their employees on how much for example, to pay, what the maximum to pay would be for the materials or real estate or things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.177" offset="5364067">The agencies were afraid that if they had to release those decisions after they were made, but before they would carry out; that is before the sales, the purchases were consummated, but their plans would be severely frustrated, and it’s not hard to imagine why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.170" offset="5428015">It’s also of more than passing interest here today that Congress at that time was also informed of the serious problems that were likely to occur if the Federal Open Market Committee’s policy decisions concerning purchase or sales of securities in the open market had to be prematurely disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.225" offset="5500322">Now the House and Senate Committee reports on the FOIA state that Exemption 5 was drafted to meet those concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.895" offset="5526967">The reports indicate that premature disclosure of final agency plans and not just the disclosure of internal agency materials generated before an agency’s plans were finalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.294" offset="5572524">We meant to be covered by the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.874" offset="5582869">This congressional intent is also clearly reflected we think in the language of the exemption itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.174" offset="5604080">Exemption 5 has finally drafted, permits the non-disclosure of quote, inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters, which would not be available to a party in litigation with the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.824" offset="5658624">Congress had been concerned only with preventing public access to pre-decisional memoranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.726" offset="5682239">This obviously would have been a rather peculiar way of achieving that result.</text>

            <text syncTime="1524.192" offset="6200090">Now, there is a large body of materials that fall somewhere in between, that may or may not be discoverable in litigation against the government depending upon the relative needs of the Plaintiff and the defendant, if the defendant is government agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.813" offset="6254634">Now, we think that what Congress intended and we think there is much in the legislative history and in this court’s opinions construing Exemption 5, which supports this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.302" offset="6292564">What Congress intended that the District Court would engage in the same sort of balancing process when confronted with an FOIA request for that type of material?</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.378" offset="6324851">What he would balance is the government’s need, the government’s need for secrecy and I should emphasize here that the government is not contending that these documents need never be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.387" offset="6364871">We are only suggesting that because of important government interest, they needn’t be disclosed immediately, but rather should only be disclosed four weeks after they are adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.067" offset="6403636">What would be weighed against the interest that the government puts forward in support of limited non-disclosure would be the public interest, not the interest of the individual FOIA litigant in gaining access to these particular documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.063" offset="6459643">It’s clear that under the FOIA, you are not allowed to inquire into the interest of the particular Plaintiff who has made the FOIA request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.466" offset="6493288">But I think it’s clear that you have to inquire in order to engage in this balancing process into what the public interest is.</text>

            <text syncTime="2181.283" offset="8828531">We respectfully disagree with that contention because we say that this court in the series case said that Exemption 5 was designed to protect agency deliberations, a kind of specialized application if you will of the document of executive privilege.</text>

            <text syncTime="3471.534" offset="13989491">Their test is that if it would impair the implementation of the policy and that they have prove this is relevant, they have never had a chance to prove that because the District Court and the Court of Appeals said that’s irrelevant, but if it’s relevant, I would assume that we are not out of court, we go back to the District Court for a trial of some kind on that issue, which there will be a battle of experts, I can assure this court; theirs against ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.506" offset="14097429">It just strikes me, when you contemplate that is a solution, it seems to achieve result, which could not have been intended and certainly is not one of the objectives of the Freedom of Information Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3528.396" offset="14216965">One of the cardinal principles of the act as we read it is that all government policy statements, all agency policy statements, not specifically exempted by the act, are to be promptly published.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.251" offset="14272345">If the court please, it seems to me that, that’s a very good doctrine, seems to be that in a democratic society, the notion that the people governed have a right to know what the policies of the agencies’ governing them are, is that a reasonable doctrine and a good doctor and that’s all this case seeks.</text>
