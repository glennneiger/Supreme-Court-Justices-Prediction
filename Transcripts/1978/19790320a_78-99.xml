            <label>Mr. Michael E. Terry</label>
            <text syncTime="70.873" offset="386905">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.426" offset="397040">The case which I have the privilege of presenting to this Court began in Memphis, Tennessee in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.189" offset="420133">As the Sixth Circuit opinion states, “This matter involves a sequence of events which have the flavor of the old West before the law crossed the Pecos.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.319" offset="464645">The difference is that here, as the Sixth Circuit stated there are no real heroes and there was a trial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="99.716" offset="502262">It seems that in July of 1970, a Las Vegas gambler by the name of William Douglas came to Memphis with a gun, an alias, and a device for marking cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.622" offset="549909">Douglas sought through some local connections in Memphis, a card game.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.249" offset="568404">He was introduced eventually to a Memphis gambler by the name of Robert Wood.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.667" offset="590033">Wood apparently felt that through his skill at poker he would be relieved Douglas of his money.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.246" offset="620335">However, Douglas opted for the advantages of marking the cards rather than the uncertainties of skill and in three head to head matches he relieved Wood, Robert Wood, of approximately $5,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.253" offset="688358">And Wood apparently had some confidence in himself and in his game because he didn't blame the losses on his own incompetence and began to suspect that he was being cheated.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.289" offset="740498">He became convinced that he was being cheated and together with his brother, Joe Wood, had formed a plan to recoup his losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.291" offset="776547">That plan involved using Joe Wood and three respondents in this matter to rob a fourth poker game between Mr. Douglas and Robert Wood.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.724" offset="830255">Thus, Robert Wood's plan in a nutshell was to recoup his gambling losses by the robbery proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.695" offset="862124">Prior to the night of the fourth game, Mr. Joe Wood, his brother and two of the respondents here, Hamilton and Pickens, went to the scene of the fourth game, looked it over, plan their strategy and according to the evidence there was some discussion on how the proceeds would be split.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.471" offset="965256">On that night of the game, there were four people in the room when the game began, Robert Wood, Joe Wood, Mr. Douglas, and an individual, by the name Tommy Thomas, who said to be a mutual acquaintance of Douglas and Robert Wood.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.215" offset="1052191">About 9 o'clock of that evening, Joe Wood began to unfold the robbery plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.899" offset="1078941">He got up and said he was going to the store to buy some beer.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.347" offset="1096808">He went outside and he met with the three respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.178" offset="1112064">They did go to the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.250" offset="1116348">They did buy some beer but apparently they station their cars some place suitable to their plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.577" offset="1145710">And they approach the apartment together and Mr. Douglas became suspicious.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.269" offset="1164413">He heard noise outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.114" offset="1171832">He armed himself with a shotgun.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.048" offset="1183535">Now Joe Wood removed the three respondents from right outside the door of the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.051" offset="1215613">Before Douglas could see him and he was allowed to crawl backed into the apartment while being watched with Douglas who was on with a shotgun.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.694" offset="1254170">Once Joe Wood was back inside, the game continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.795" offset="1274546">The three respondents were outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.803" offset="1286562">Joe Wood then, short time later telling the people inside that he had to use the bathroom, entered the bathroom of the apartment and came out armed with a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.046" offset="1343509">He apparently was a little nervous at that time because he gave the gun to his brother, Robert Wood, who was seated at the table playing cards with Douglas and Joe Wood left leaving the door to the apartment open.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.146" offset="1404008">Tommy Thomas at that time was lying on floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.878" offset="1418846">He got up, closed the door and attempted to mediate between Douglas and Robert Wood.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.708" offset="1442252">As the evidence shows, Douglas apparently reached for a gun that was in his belt at that time and Robert Wood killed by --</text>

            <text syncTime="360.876" offset="1546846">They fired two shots within the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.286" offset="1560534">Rob Thomas of some $50.00 to $80.00, took the proceeds off the table, took a knife and then the five eventual defendants in this case, the two Wood brothers and the three respondents here, Hamilton, Pickens, and Randolph left.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.628" offset="1633886">Subsequently, they went from there according to the evidence over the Hamilton's apartment where they hid the weapons, divided up the money and went there separate ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.088" offset="1675682">Douglas of course died.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.565" offset="1693654">Subsequently, they were all either arrested or they turned themselves within to the Memphis Police Department.</text>

            <text syncTime="454.309" offset="1920606">What I -- what I mean by that is I don't think that redaction when there's two defendants sitting there and the references are the two others is ever a substitution for cross-examination or confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.726" offset="1982255">But I do think it's a factor to be considered when you get to the issue of the devastating effect of the co-defendants' statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="665.289" offset="2764570">We think the most important distinction between this case and Bruton is that in this case the parties raising the Bruton objection had confess themselves that their confessions are internally consistent, that they corroborate each other and then they have been redacted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1705.034" offset="6923473">Now, the first issue involved in the matter of coming up from the Sixth Circuit was that involving the interpretation of Bruton, Schneble, and Harrington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.367" offset="6976867">We maintain in our original response file in our position to the state's petition that the state has erroneously characterized the facts of this case to Schneble and Harrington, and more or less overlooked the significance of the Bruton Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.555" offset="7053563">If you would notice in their briefs, they discount the importance of Bruton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.863" offset="7074774">I think that in every decision of this Court has some constitutional significance and Bruton certainly stands as a landmark on the question of violation of right to a confrontation and right to a cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.657" offset="7146036">As Mr. Chief Justice Burger stated and Davis versus Alaska, and also this Court in Pointer v. Texas and Douglas versus Alabama that the right to cross-examination is very much apart of the right of confrontation as stated in our Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.786" offset="7234539">This case in our opinion will present somewhat of a precedent in the sense it would clear the air on the question of harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.596" offset="7273723">The cases of Harrington and Schneble did not overrule Bruton which Mr. Justice Brennan wrote his rare reason argument on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.575" offset="7317713">This case is a case as Mr. Justice Stevens indicated involving the question of harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.883" offset="7354911">Now, we talk about harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.310" offset="7360658">We must look at Chapman v. California, Fahy versus Connecticut, Schneble v. Florida, Harrington v. California, and the Court has consistently stated that harmless error means harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.335" offset="7432756">And it is the federal standard which this Court should consider as indicated in the case of Fahy versus Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.876" offset="7466924">Now, the crucial facts of this case as they relate to the respondent's convictions are probably to two basic theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.180" offset="7512064">The one promoted by the state and the theory of possible theories supported by us in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.034" offset="7543515">And the state has made a sum conclusory statements throughout these proceedings which have indicated the facts of this case show very clearly that these respondents were part of the plan to rob.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.588" offset="7601716">But a close examination and the view of the record in our opinion could lead this Court to conclude to the contrary are certain that lead this Court to conclude that the facts are not clear as to the respondents' involvement in these whole proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.945" offset="7675173">Now, the District Court and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals for purposes of ruling on Bruton accepted the theory most favorable to the state on the question of the respondents' involvement in these whole proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="3091.167" offset="12468015">Whether the violation of the Bruton rule was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt and in considering the question of harmless error, the evidence presented before the Court is very much important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.510" offset="12525380">The only evidence introduced were the testimonies of five supposedly impartial witnesses whose only test among was limited to their statements that they saw three blacks outside the door of the apartment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3128.521" offset="12617435">Another with two witnesses said, a white and three blacks but no way in the record could we find any testimony of these supposed impartial witnesses that these respondents had any weapons in their hands that they did anything of then either appear at the door and/or kicked the door in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.828" offset="12710640">The crucial testimony in this case comes from Robert Wood, who gave an initial statement to the police before his indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.164" offset="12755989">In which he stated very clearly, I cannot -- I cannot identify these blacks that came in and consistent with the original plan of Robert Wood, Joe Wood and Tommy Thomas to place all the blame on three unidentified blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.922" offset="12831013">And the record will show in reading the statements of Tommy Thomas and also of Robert Wood that Joe Wood, Robert Wood and Tommy Thomas met after this incident to concoct the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.409" offset="12889004">To put this whole murder on three unidentified blacks who supposedly came into the room, shot the victim, and left with all the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.457" offset="12933204">But after some investigation apparently the police did not believe that version and subsequently, indicted the Wood brothers along with three respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.498" offset="12977403">Now I think that in considering the question of harmless error, the Court cannot turn his head to the complaint of coercion and as the Sixth Circuit said, that was a very vivid complaint of coercion and physical abuse as it relates to these three confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.964" offset="13047202">And it would be our contention that this -- the existence of this kind of abuse, a word create a sort of tainted character to these confessions and we're not dealing with unchallenged confessions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3519.185" offset="14180080">And one factor that tends to make a jury sometimes disbelieve a confession is if they think that there was some brutality attached to coercing the conviction.</text>
