            <text syncTime="20.157" offset="183986">The petitioner in this case, Jane Aronson, in 1955 made an invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.257" offset="208436">That invention was the design of a particular kind of key ring or key holder.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.152" offset="236022">Now, the particular design of that key holder is not really material to this case, but I think I should note that it is different from the design shown in the English patent which is attached to the brief of the amicus Ercon and it is different from the design shown in the (Inaudible) patent which is a part of the record in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="70.595" offset="385755">It is not Your Honor except that the only reason I mentioned the particular -- that it is different from the design shown in those patents is the argument of the amicus Ercon, that it was in the public domain or known before the invention by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.745" offset="450330">The closest thing that describes it is the catalog of the respondent Quick Point, which is in the printed record, but you cannot see the inside of the key ring.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="98.394" offset="496933">Alright.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="c_lee_cook_jr" startTime="100.660" stopTime="400.874">
            <label>Mr. C. Lee Cook, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="100.660" offset="506023">Having made this invention and having prepared and filed a patent application which disclosed and described the invention, she took it to a number of potential manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.071" offset="551685">One of those manufacturers was the respondent Quick Point Pencil Company in St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.438" offset="573106">The then President of Quick Point was very interested in manufacturing this article and he proposed a license agreement which called for a 5% royalty on the sales of the article by Quick Point.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.353" offset="624828">At the request of petitioner, an addendum was prepared to this license agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.976" offset="651264">That addendum provided that if no patent were issued within a five years, the royalty rate would be reduced to 2.5%, but that royalty would continue as long as Quick Point made the article.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.179" offset="716048">Now no patent was ever obtained and at the end of the five-year period, the royalty was reduced to 2.5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.163" offset="748022">Quick Point paid those royalties for many years after it was known that no patent was obtained and after repeatedly reaffirmed its obligation to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.011" offset="791385">Now although the article was secret at the time it was first disclosed to Quick Point and it was disclosed at Quick Point and the others under an obligation of confidence, it is the nature of the invention is such that once it was put on commercial sale, it was revealed to the public and could be copied by others.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.816" offset="866617">And indeed by the late 1960's, a number of other companies were making devices substantially identical to Quick Point's.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.975" offset="907264">Now in 1975, Quick Point stopped paying royalties and brought this suit for declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.313" offset="936626">It contended in the suit that the agreement was illegal and unenforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.079" offset="955643">It did not contend as respondent's brief in this Court contends that the intention of the parties was that no royalties would be due if no patent were obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.909" offset="999006">On the contrary, it contended the opposite that is that the agreement bound Quick Point to pay royalties even if no patent were obtained and that made the agreement illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.872" offset="1046862">On a stipulated record and cross motions for summary judgment, the district court found that the agreement was clear and unambiguous, that it was valid and enforceable under the state law and that there was no reason in the federal patent policy or the federal antitrust policy for the federal courts to interfere with its enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.478" offset="1133275">The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in a two-to-one decision, reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.115" offset="1155845">It held that the principles involved in the federal patent law precluded Quick Point from being bound by its agreement, because no patent was issued and the article had become publicly known.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.286" offset="1212479">It was no longer a secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.819" offset="1222614">District Judge Larson sitting by designation decided saying that in his view, the matter should be controlled by state contract law and that there was no reason for the federal courts to preempt and refuse to enforce the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.081" offset="1287711">Thus the question presented by this case is does the federal patent law preempt the state law and prevent enforcement of a contract calling for continuing royalties on a previously secret article simply because no patent was issued and the article is no longer a secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.354" offset="1376737">Now we submit that the decision of the Court of Appeals here constitutes an unnecessary interference by the federal courts with the normal application of state contract law.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.121" offset="1435878">That interference was not required by nor even consistent with the federal patent law.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.840" offset="1462732">I intend to deal primarily with the error of the Court of Appeals with respect to the federal patent law.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.730" offset="1494288">We believe also that there is nothing inconsistent about enforcing this agreement with the federal antitrust laws or the policy of free and open competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.677" offset="1526053">That subject matter is however covered very thoroughly in the briefs, particularly the brief of the United States amicus and I believe that Mr. Grossman who will speak on behalf of the United States will also touch on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.528" offset="1569520">Specifically I want to deal with three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.817" offset="1582686">First, that this case is governed by the rule laid down by this Court in Kewanee Oil versus Bicron.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.501" offset="1613406">Secondly; that the Court of Appeals failed to apply that test, and thirdly, if that test is applied to the state contract law involved in this case, it is clear that the objectives of the federal patent law are not interfered with and that there is no conflict between the federal patent law and the state contract law in this case.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="400.874" stopTime="404.872">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="400.874" offset="1706820">That really just one point, isn't it that this case is governed by Kewanee?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="c_lee_cook_jr" startTime="404.872" stopTime="510.810">
            <label>Mr. C. Lee Cook, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="404.872" offset="1722911">Yes, it really is and I don't think that there can be any doubt that it is governed by Kewanee.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.835" offset="1750706">The Court will recall in that case, that it sustained the validity of state trade secret law, which permitted an owner of a trade secret to sue former employees for misappropriating those trade secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.329" offset="1812668">In that case, the Court reaffirmed its prior holding that the patent law is not exclusive and that the state law should be enforced unless it conflicts with the patent law or the federal law, and the way to determine whether a state law conflicts with a federal law, the Court said, was to look at whether it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the objectives of the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.356" offset="1924786">Now the objective of the federal patent law as set forth in the Constitution is to promote the progress of science and the useful arts; in other words, to encourage invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.228" offset="1980270">The patent law encourages invention in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.724" offset="2002317">First, it offers the inventor a patent, which for a limited period of time permits that inventor to exclude others from making, using or selling his invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.979" offset="2047248">Secondly, in return for that extraordinary grant, it requires the inventor to disclose fully his invention to the public in the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.674" offset="2086118">And that way, not only is the public free to use it after the expiration of the patent, but it becomes a part of the body of knowledge and that itself should contribute to and stimulate further inventions or other advances in the art.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="510.810" stopTime="533.743">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="510.810" offset="2146617">In your view Mr. Cook, would the case be any different?</text>
            <text syncTime="516.168" offset="2168038">If no patent had been applied for, but the idea that might have been presented to the respondent company and then they made the agreement for either a 2.5% straight or whatever.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="c_lee_cook_jr" startTime="533.743" stopTime="741.262">
            <label>Mr. C. Lee Cook, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="533.743" offset="2238360">In my view Mr. Chief Justice, the case would be no different, because in this case, the petitioner took nothing from the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.847" offset="2274722">She never got a patent and whether it was revealed in a patent or contained in a patent application is really irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.761" offset="2306382">The point is she revealed an idea, she made a contract and there is no reason for this respondent to get out of its obligation to pay the royalties under that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.970" offset="2351208">The test thus therefore under Kewanee is whether enforcing this agreement will discourage invention or prevent the disclosure of inventions to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.049" offset="2411604">The Court of Appeals nowhere applied this test.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.498" offset="2425396">It did not even consider it as far as we can tell from the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.007" offset="2439398">There is no discussion of the analysis or the test in Kewanee at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.837" offset="2458728">Although it made reference to Kewanee, it did not discuss its test.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.217" offset="2480253">When that test is applied here however, it is clear that enforcing this agreement will not create an obstacle to the accomplishment of the objectives of the patent law, but will instead further those objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.442" offset="2549112">It will certainly not discourage invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.383" offset="2560920">On the other hand, it will encourage invention to enforce agreement such as this because inventors if they know that they can enter into agreement such as this will be willing to expand the time effort and money without concern as to whether their invention is patentable or not or without concern as to whether their invention is one which can be kept secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.067" offset="2651617">And as this Court noted in Kewanee, often an important invention may not be patentable, but it is nevertheless an important invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.732" offset="2694248">Under the law prior to the decision in the Court of Appeals, if the inventor made a valuable invention and the manufacturer was willing to pay for it, the inventor could have the expectation of entering into an enforceable agreement which would provide him a reward for his invention and he would therefore be encouraged to invent.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.200" offset="2776168">Failure to enforce this agreement on the other hand will discourage invention, because the inventor who cannot obtain a patent will be faced with two alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.458" offset="2817233">He can go into the manufacture of the article himself which this Court noted in Kewanee may not be the best allocation of our economic resources or he can attempt to sell it for a single lump sum payment before it becomes a big secret, get all of his money immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.531" offset="2885465">But that is often difficult too, because licensees are reluctant to make substantial payments until they know what the commercial success of the invention would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.704" offset="2934157">Not only will enforcement of this agreement encourage invention, it will cause those inventions to be made available and known to the public sooner rather than later.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.266" offset="2980446">Rather than waiting to see if he can obtain a patent under agreements of this type, the inventor puts his article or his invention out to the public immediately; not only into the commercial channels where it may benefit the economy but also to the public so that they can copy it or be stimulated to make further and additional inventions.</text>

            <text syncTime="741.262" offset="3068426">But on some inventions, the copying of it is not easy, because the content is discernible.</text>

          <turn speaker="c_lee_cook_jr" startTime="767.667" stopTime="1210.433">
            <label>Mr. C. Lee Cook, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="767.667" offset="3174066">And that is really the truly anomalous thing about the Court of Appeals' decision and the position of the respondent in this case, because if this invention had been one which could be kept secret and was not revealed upon its sale to the public, the Court of Appeals and the respondent would say the agreement is enforceable, and yet the objectives of the patent law are furthered much better by an agreement where the invention becomes public and available to the public than they are in a situation where the invention by its nature remain secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.440" offset="3321083">Yet in this Court, in Kewanee specifically approved, not only enforcing implied agreements against employees, but contracts for inventions where the subject matter of the invention remained secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.323" offset="3388688">Now really nowhere in respondent's brief, does respondent ever contend that enforcement of this agreement will discourage invention or discourage the disclosure of invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.116" offset="3443858">And that is because it is impossible to make that contention on these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.447" offset="3465174">Under Kewanee, if the enforcement of the state law will not interfere with the accomplishment of the patent law objectives of encouraging invention and encouraging disclosure to the public of inventions which is the case here, there is no need; there is no reason for the federal courts to interfere with the normal application of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.835" offset="3558693">Now instead of dealing with this point, the respondent argues that the difficulty here is that enforcing agreements of this type will cause inventors who apply for a patent to abandon those patent applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.427" offset="3645106">The argument goes that an inventor will apply for a patent, get an agreement such as this, and then abandon the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.991" offset="3679378">That argument we believe is unsound for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.111" offset="3695783">First, it is factually unsound.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.582" offset="3709680">As this Court noted in Kewanee, the benefits of a patent are such that it is very unlikely that anyone who really has a patentable invention will abandon that patent application.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.533" offset="3761507">Secondly, it is particularly true where as in this case, the commercial use of the invention discloses it to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.229" offset="3812289">We are not talking about the famous coca cola formula which Mr. Justice Marshall referred to in his concurring opinion in Kewanee.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.929" offset="3843114">We are talking about an invention that when it is sold, it is publicly known.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.536" offset="3865475">Under those circumstances, the chance is that a patent applicant will in bad faith in order to take advantage of his licensee, somehow abandon a patent application on a valid patentable invention are remote indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.052" offset="3927542">Moreover, this problem if indeed it is a problem, is one which easily can be solved by draftsmanship.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.085" offset="3959724">The contract can say the patentee or the licenser will diligently pursue the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.424" offset="3985115">And then if he does not do so, he has breached the agreement, or it can say that the licensee may have the right to prosecute the patent application; a provision that is quite common and frequent in patent license agreement, or it can provide that if no patent is obtained, the royalties will cease or they will cease after a given number of years or they will cease after the production of a given number of units or the payment of a given amount of royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.159" offset="4083963">All of those are ways of overcoming this problem if indeed it is a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.244" offset="4108309">But let us assume for the moment, for purposes of argument, that there would be some incentive by a patent applicant who has a license agreement such as this to abandon the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.227" offset="4156270">That does not mean that enforcing this agreement will stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the patent laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.865" offset="4182810">As this Court pointed out in Kewanee, some diversion from the patent system is permissible and the diversion in the patent from the patent system or the potential diversion from the patent system in Kewanee is much greater than the potential diversion here, because in Kewanee, it contemplated an invention which remained secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.993" offset="4263372">There at least the owner of the invention has an option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.348" offset="4276746">He can say, I will get the patent, but if I get that, it becomes public or I can keep it secret and try to protect my rights by keeping it secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.385" offset="4312900">Here the inventor has no such choice because once he puts his article on sale, it becomes public and he cannot keep it secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.397" offset="4348949">The diversion from the patent system, if indeed there is any, is much less in this case than in the facts presented in Kewanee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.135" offset="4395865">As I mentioned before in answer to Mr. Chief Justice's question, the fact is that both the Court of Appeals and respondent here would have enforced this agreement if the subject matter of the agreement had not been the article which became public upon its sale, but for example the process by which it is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.593" offset="4493772">Even though a patent application had been applied for and abandoned under the rationale of the decision below, that agreement would be enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.911" offset="4527000">Yet merely because the invention here was one which became public upon its sale, the Court of Appeal says, it is not enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.584" offset="4561690">Yet I submit to you that the circumstances here are less inconsistent and indeed more, they are in fact consistent with the objectives of the patent law, much more so than in the case where the invention can be kept secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.776" offset="4614457">Finally this argument of respondent we believe deals not with the objectives of the patent law, but with the means by which the patent chooses to accomplish those objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.394" offset="4664926">The important thing here is not whether somebody gets a patent, the important thing is that they make inventions and that they disclose those inventions to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.440" offset="4701184">The fact that the state law will encourage invention and encourage the disclosure does not make it inconsistent with the federal patent law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.756" offset="4742353">Indeed as this Court noted in Kewanee, certainly the patent policy of encouraging invention is not disturbed by the existence of another form of incentive to invent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.433" offset="4797106">The state contract law involved in this case and the federal patent law are not in conflict; they are in harmony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.180" offset="4832110">Both can stand together; one complimenting the other to encourage research and innovation which is vital to our economy and to the continued growth of our nation, probably more so today than in any time in our history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.520" offset="4893445">The decision of the Court of Appeals thwarts that encouragement of invention, and unnecessarily strikes down the state law; it should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.294" offset="4932524">Your Honor, I would like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1231.833" offset="5030745">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.644" offset="5046000">The issue before you today is whether state laws, which enforce contracts of the type here at issue, which so significantly impede federal pattern or competition policy as to require preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.292" offset="5116531">Preemption issues of this type have been resolved by the Court by defining the specific federal pattern and competition policies articulated by Congress and carefully analyzing the impact on such policies that would result from enforcement under state law of various types of contract or procedural rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.935" offset="5219140">Applying such analysis to this case, United States has concluded that enforcement of the contracts such as that entered into between Mrs. Aronson and Quick Point would not adversely impact any federal policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.723" offset="5294268">On the contrary, we believe that the availability of such contractual means of rewarding inventors will foster the achievement of innovation, rapid disclosure of new ideas, and new entry into commercial markets, goes at the very heart of federal pattern and competition policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.382" offset="5400952">Since petitioner's counsel has devoted most of his remarks to pattern policy, I should like to start my remarks with a discussion of the impact of this contract on federal competition policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.935" offset="5463124">Contracts of the type which concern us today pose no danger to federal competition policy that cannot be checked by the normal application of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.521" offset="5517458">Statements by respondent to the effect that enforcement of the contract will promote monopoly in contrast to free competition portray a misunderstanding of both of those consents.</text>

            <text syncTime="1369.054" offset="5579630">Mr. Grossman, are you suggesting that there are contracts which would be enforceable under state law, which do not violate the antitrust laws, but which would nevertheless be preempted by what you referred to as federal competition policy?</text>

            <text syncTime="1388.580" offset="5657684">I mean, it is conceivable that contracts enforceable under state law could violate federal antitrust policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.174" offset="5688090">For example, a requirements contract, which under the antitrust standard, would foreclose an unreasonable portion of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.619" offset="5721840">They could be enforceable under state law, but violative of the antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.793" offset="5738559">One could ever contract that would not be violative of antitrust laws, but would nevertheless frustrate federal patent policy, but I am not suggesting that there is some level of impact on competition beneath the dignity as it were of an antitrust violation that would nevertheless require preemption, unless it frustrated some other federal policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1538.483" offset="6257351">That's right Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.011" offset="6267382">Nor does this case involve monopoly power in the sense that it is used under the antitrust laws, namely the power to control price or forestall entries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.005" offset="6311372">The degree of market power conferred on a licensee, a commercially valuable idea, will depend on a number of factors, including the degree to which the product is differentiated in different or competing products, the degree to which the idea can be easily ascertained and used by competitors, and the extent to which competitors have offsetting advantages relative to the licensee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.434" offset="6433102">Now we don't suggest that indeterminate licenses of commercially usual ideas could never contravene federal antitrust policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.286" offset="6472495">What we do suggest is that the likelihood is not so great as to warn what is the equivalent to an antitrust rule of per se illegality implemented in the form of patent preemption of state contract law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.429" offset="6541040">Our policy of free competition does not mandate competition free of any and all contractual restrains.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.707" offset="6582209">Only those restrains, which are deemed unreasonable, are prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.973" offset="6607287">Economic analysis did not indicate that licenses of the type here at issue inherently restrain competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.465" offset="6645217">Moreover, we lack experience or evidence, which would indicate that such contracts will unreasonably restrain trade in such a wide variety of cases as to justify a per se rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.175" offset="6716061">As this Court noted last term in Exxon v. State of Maryland, the fact that one could reasonably high hypothesize situations in which competition might be impeded does not justify preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.266" offset="6776456">The existence of the antitrust law should provide sufficient protection against any significant competitive restrains arising from contracts of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.405" offset="6832985">Unfortunately, the Court of Appeals' decision could produce results inimical to the goals of antitrust policy to the extent that it decreases the available incentives for innovative effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.282" offset="6900485">It adversely impacts on the dynamic core of our free enterprise system to the extent that it increases risks to both inventors and licensees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.040" offset="6955551">It is likely to channel inventions to the larger firms, who are better able to spread and absorb those risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.633" offset="6993899">Such a trend of course would foster greater industrial concentration contrary to national competition policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.250" offset="7060355">I would like to address just one point on the patent policy and its relation to contracts of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.874" offset="7098911">I believe the critical core of respondent's argument is stated on page 28 of its brief, which says that the risk is that inventors such as Aronson, who believe their inventions to be patentable will have every incentive to license their inventions during the period the application is pending and then abandon their application in order to obtain royalties for a period longer than allowed by the patent laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.980" offset="7263274">We suggest that this argument is inconsistent with this Court's decision in Kewanee, unsound as a matter of economic analysis, and unsupported by empirical evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.833" offset="7334745">It appears unsound is a matter of economic analysis, not only as to the specifics of this case, but in the general run of cases as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.925" offset="7387094">Here, Mrs. Aronson's failure to obtain the patent hardly redounded to her economic benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.367" offset="7428890">There are three components, which determine how much money an inventor such as Mrs. Aronson would make in a situation like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.852" offset="7470791">One is the royalty rate, which she will receive and the second is the unit price of the goods sold, and the third is the number of units sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.344" offset="7520737">Reduction at anyone of these three numbers or components will reduce her total compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.896" offset="7546964">Here, we know from the record that the failure to obtain a patent reduced two of those components, and economic theory would indicate that the third was also reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.585" offset="7605687">Here, her royalty rate was cut in half and also the total sales on which that royalty rate was based would be decreased.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.808" offset="7650617">Instead of obtaining a percentage on all sales, embodying her idea as would been the case, had the patent been issued, she only receive moneys on those sales made by Quick Point whose share of the overall market declined as new entrants begin making key holders reflecting her ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.297" offset="7736508">Additionally, economic theory teaches that a monopolist is capable of charging a higher price for its goods and could be obtained for them in a competitive market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.439" offset="7785096">As to the extent the disclosure of her trade secret open the market to competition, the selling price of Quick Point's key chains on which the inventor's royalty was based may have been reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.771" offset="7842461">The same economic analysis would lead one to believe that most inventors are likely to prefer the 17-year monopoly returns afforded by a patent system to the less certain rewards that could be obtained under a contract law, even if those awards might be spread out beyond the termination of a patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.545" offset="7933576">This certainly was the conclusion of this Court in Kewanee and we are unaware of any empirical information or body of academic literature developed since Kewanee, which challenges the reasonableness or correctness of that conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2320.789" offset="9386506">Two similar devices were patented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.604" offset="9401762">I suggest that first on the ground that it shows that the Kewanee decision is not applicable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.207" offset="9436244">This case does not involve a trade secret as that term was used in Kewanee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.574" offset="9465710">I think it is also relevant because there are arguments here that these indefinite royalties are justified because of the head start that Quick Point got when the secret was disclosed to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.851" offset="9526732">And that head start, was worth a great deal, which could be compensated for by royalties indefinitely in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.332" offset="9564662">I think the exhibits themselves show that the head start here though probably something was not much, neither in terms of capital cost, nor in terms of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.923" offset="9623071">Now at the outset, I think it is very important to recall that this case involves a relatively narrow issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.195" offset="9664136">There are amicus briefs, which discuss extensively problems of technology and knowhow licensing in billions of dollars which is effected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.256" offset="9712410">But this case does not involve any aspect of technology or knowhow licensing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.322" offset="9740622">Any decision on that question should of course await a record and briefs which deal with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.848" offset="9774791">And some of the briefs and the government's briefs in particular talk extensively of trade secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.693" offset="9806137">Indeed the government's brief uses the phrase traded secrets of more than 40 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.282" offset="9836544">But this is not a trade secret case in the sense in which that term is customarily used and what -- as it was involved before the Court in the Kewanee case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.435" offset="9885132">Indeed in the Court's opinion in the Kewanee case, the Court said on page 484, by definition a trade secret has not been placed in the public domain, but this key holder has been placed in the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.797" offset="9962559">It has been public since 1956, 22 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.889" offset="9990980">It's there for everyone to see and to copy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.456" offset="10013236">There is no secret way of doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.923" offset="10027029">No secret formula or process in continues use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.889" offset="10046882">No device which is used in the course of business, but not disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.412" offset="10069034">Here the item was fully disclosed as soon as the key holder was put on the market as the contract contemplated it would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.850" offset="10118771">The distinction seems to be to some to be more subtle than I should think it would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.984" offset="10147297">I think I can illustrate it by the fact that I was counsel for the petitioner in the Kewanee case and one of the first things I did was to come to the Court and meet with the clerk and make arrangements for the impoundment of the record so that the secrets which were included in it would not be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.467" offset="10233292">There has been no necessity for impounding the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.596" offset="10265788">There was no secret here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.057" offset="10275610">No need for reverse engineering which is talked about in the patent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.747" offset="10314376">Since 1956, the secret has been in the public domain.</text>

            <text syncTime="2612.342" offset="10552717">The second paragraph of the letter of June 26, 1956, “Quick Point Pencil Company will have the exclusive right to make and sell key holders of the type shown in your application, Serial No. 542677 and will start manufacturing within 60 days.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3697.354" offset="14892805">I don't think it is entirely clear that this contract made between layman should be construed as a matter of contract law requiring indefinite continuing payment of royalties over an definite period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.375" offset="14984861">Now it's true that the patent application gave no rights to the applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.505" offset="15013386">There can be no infringement of a patent application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.315" offset="15032613">Nevertheless a patent application has a substantial in terrorem effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.487" offset="15061347">When a competitor sees patent pending on an item he is disinclined to make the item despite the fact that he knows that it is not protected until the patent is obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.023" offset="15119444">He doesn't want to incur the capital costs with starting production of the item, setting up his sales force, printing catalogs and so on, when he knows that he may soon be foreclosed by the granting of a patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.880" offset="15182869">The licensing of an application and the use of the patent pending designation are part of the benefits expressly recognized by the patent law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.163" offset="15220067">I have already referred to Section 291 -- 261, but Section 292 is the provision which makes it a crime to use patent pending on an article unless indeed you are the applicant or the licensee of a patent application in which case you can use it and that undoubtedly provides important leverage in determining -- in the bargaining process which determines the amount of the royalties under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.339" offset="15392684">The heart of this case I suggest is found in the fact that there was a patent application and that the contract was made with respect to that application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.775" offset="15442422">The petitioner used the patent laws and the application had value because of its potentiality under the patent laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.512" offset="15493413">No one would pay a substantial amount for a non-exclusive license to make this article.</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.519" offset="15537403">As the affidavit of the petitioner appearing on page 55 of the record shows the key holder was disclosed to several commercial enterprises while negotiations with the respondent were pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.523" offset="15605426">If Quick Point had not come to an agreement with the petitioner for an exclusive license, the petitioner could have sought to make an agreement with one or the other commercial enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.714" offset="15662268">If an exclusive license had been granted to a competing company, Quick Point would have been frozen out if a patent was granted and for practical purposes could not have made the article while the patent application was pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3907.111" offset="15731858">On the other hand Quick Point knew that if the petitioner obtained the patent on the device, the exclusive license would assure the Quick Point had the right to manufacture the key holder free from competition for the patent period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3924.743" offset="15802389">Quick Point, in this case, bargained not only for disclosure, but also for the future exclusive right to use the invention once a patent was obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3939.045" offset="15859545">In short, the patent application which was an integral part of the process established by the government under the patent laws pursuant to the Patent Clause of the Constitution gave the petitioner bargaining leverage which she could not have had if she had not first filed a patent application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3967.406" offset="15973021">The mere fact of the patent application gave the petitioner, gave the respondent considerable likelihood of protection against competitors while the patent application was pending and in this way the patent law was used as leverage where the petitioner's benefit, but the patent laws gave more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.987" offset="16067271">They gave hope that a patent would be obtained and in that event the contract gave Quick Point the exclusive right to make and sell the item.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.993" offset="16119306">This was a prospect made possible by the patent laws and it was fully utilized by the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4015.433" offset="16165073">The petitioner entered into the patent process and she obtained a substantial benefit because she invoked the patent laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4025.171" offset="16204048">Without the patent applications she would have been in a no position at all to obtain substantial royalties for this time, which was -- for this item, which was incapable of exploitation without full disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.783" offset="16266533">She used the patent laws successfully even though she did not obtain a patent and her contract should be qualified by law in accordance with the principles which had been developed in several patent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4059.930" offset="16343124">It is important again to recall that we are not dealing here with a continuing trade secret as in Kewanee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.750" offset="16382412">There was a secret here, but it was inherently time limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.753" offset="16406340">Once the article was made and marketed, the secret was fully disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4081.839" offset="16430686">And thus as far as the objective of disclosure under the patent system is concerned a decision in favor of Quick Point will have no adverse effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4094.372" offset="16480841">The holder of an idea for a secret device like this can keep it to himself if he wishes to do so, but if he wants to realize it on it he must disclose it, there is no alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.913" offset="16535071">He can of course apply for a patent without licensing the device in which case there will be no disclosure until a patent is issued and he will have no return from the idea while the patent is pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="4123.080" offset="16595675">On the other hand he can license the idea with or without applying for a patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.020" offset="16623470">If he licenses the idea without applying for a patent, he can only hope to obtain head start value from the licensee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.841" offset="16662758">And I suggest in this case that would be very small since the idea will be fully disclosed as soon as the licensee puts the item on the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4150.999" offset="16707375">The only way that the inventor can hope to get more is to apply for a patent, thus utilizing the patent laws and then seek to license the patent application in the hope for a patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4165.795" offset="16766516">That is what was done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.557" offset="16777592">The petitioner chose to proceed under the patent system and she got great leverage from the patent system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4176.221" offset="16808208">Who would have paid very much for this idea on a non-exclusive basis which would have been the situation if no patent had been applied for.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.791" offset="16866513">Now turning again to Kewanee, I point out that it did not involve a license situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4196.638" offset="16889919">There was no question about the validity of a license or about the validity of a license extending for an indefinite period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4206.905" offset="16930983">What it involved was a classic trade secret, breach of employment contract situation in which the Court was asked to strike down a longstanding body of State trade secret law which served important public policy objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="4225.741" offset="17006320">This the Court was understandably reluctant to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="4479.120" offset="18019871">Mr. Griswold, I suppose one could describe the federal policy at stake in Brulotte as a policy against allowing a patent monopoly to have any rewards in addition to the monopoly itself, can be enlarged to that monopoly beyond the terms of patent grant, that you can obtain royalties on unpatented articles sold with the patent or on a period after the monopoly protection is expired.</text>

            <text syncTime="4992.368" offset="20072887">I would like to deal specifically with this letter, which referred to by Dean Griswold just at the end of his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5003.311" offset="20116668">Because that letter I think also not only deals with the question of what was the intention of the party but answers also the argument about the fact that the policy really that's its involved here in terms of whether some federal policy is afforded by the existence of the patent application.</text>
            <text syncTime="5026.328" offset="20208724">That -- the argument of respondent on that point ignores I believe the fact that the parties did specifically contemplate that no patent would issue and that in that event the royalty would be reduced to 2.5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="5041.127" offset="20267865">He also argues that why would anyone sign such agreement or why would anyone enter into the agreement such as this, if he could not get exclusivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5052.200" offset="20312168">This letter, which is on page 39 of the record, I believe clearly demonstrates that the parties contemplated that they might not get exclusivity.</text>

            <text syncTime="5122.419" offset="20593037">And in Brulotte if the Court would recall, the Court's – the opinion specifically said that the rationale here does not apply to contracts involving unpatented machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="5136.049" offset="20647581">The rationale of Brulotte was as Mr. Justice Stevens pointed out if you give an inventor a monopoly by a patent, you cannot permit him to expand that monopoly whether to non-patented articles or beyond the 17 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5151.995" offset="20711320">But in this case, Aronson has taken nothing from the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="5349.248" offset="21500322">The fact of the matter is that if there is a head start value, there is no federal interest in having the Court's interfere with deciding what that value is?</text>

            <text syncTime="5366.861" offset="21570853">Why shouldn't the courts permit the state law to enforce that agreement?</text>
            <text syncTime="5371.356" offset="21588825">Now, if I could touch just briefly on the question of a trade secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="5374.650" offset="21601991">There is no doubt that when this invention was first disclosed to Quick Point, it was a trade secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="5380.386" offset="21624874">That's -- it was -- the fact that it was secret is conceded in respondent's brief, it was stipulated to in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5387.379" offset="21652877">The fact that it was a value is conceded in respondent's brief because they can see that we are entitled to substantial payments for that disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5396.168" offset="21688090">The fact that it later became public by reason of the sale, does not mean that when the contract was entered into it was a secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="5403.941" offset="21719124">But even if it were not a trade secret within the technical definition on trade secrets, it wouldn't make any difference because the principle involved here should apply whether it's an abstract idea, the concept for a television program, an advertising theme or anything that may not be a trade secret or a patentable invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="5423.525" offset="21797491">The issue involved here is what is the federal policy which is supported by permitting the states to enforce bargains entered into between parties by which one agrees to share with the other the profits he may make from the other's invention or idea and that's exactly what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5444.072" offset="21879620">And if the court's interfere with the enforcement of agreements like this, we will be taking away from potential inventors, particularly small inventors, the strong incentive to make inventions.</text>
