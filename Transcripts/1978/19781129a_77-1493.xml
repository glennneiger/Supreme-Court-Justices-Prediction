            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll hear arguments first this morning in Gladstone, Realtors against Village Of Bellwood.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.383" offset="140936">Mr. Howe, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jonathan T. Howe</label>
            <text syncTime="20.212" offset="184195">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.557" offset="201644">I am Jonathan Howe, representing the petitioner, defendants in this case -- in these cases of Gladstone Realtors and Hintze Realtors versus Village Of Bellwood.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.019" offset="239470">This case comes to this Court by way of a writ of certiorari in which the order as granting writ has stated the caution presented as whether natural persons and municipalities who are not direct victims of discrimination in the sale or rental of housing have any rights under Article III of the United States Constitution or under Sections 1982, 3604, 3612 of Title 42 of the United States Code, to bring a suit against real estate brokers who they allege to have engaged in racial steering on the theory, that racial steering interferes with such persons’ generalized interest in living in an integrated society.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.650" offset="425984">Our oral argument this morning shall focus upon the statutory construction of Sections 3604 and 3612, which will require the decision of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals to be reversed, because these plaintiffs cannot state a cause of action under 3604 or 3612 of Title 42.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.198" offset="512188">It is our contention that Section 3612 on its face provides for the enforcement of certain enumerated rights under Section 3604 and these plaintiffs before this Court possess none of these rights and therefore have no standing to pursue or to bring the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.559" offset="589615">Section 3612, it is our contention, must be read as a complementary enforcement provision of the Fair Housing Act, not as an alternative for Section 3610.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.327" offset="636635">3610 has a much broader range of complainants, the person aggrieved concept, those claiming injury or to have been injured as a result of a discriminatory housing practice is far broader than that which is provided under Section 3612.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.818" offset="706644">In addition, the legislative history of the Fair Housing Act is not contrary to the position of these defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.409" offset="737050">It is incomprehensible, that Congress would provide in Section 3610 for an administrative and agency program and deferral to states and local governments and then two sections later, totally abandon and provide a mechanism by which that provision of 3610 could be frustrated and evaded for all claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.099" offset="823777">As to Section 1982, it is the position of the defendants in this case, that plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under that Section and now the decision of this Court in Warth v. Seldin decided in 1985 is dispositive of the claims raised by the plaintiffs under Section 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.038" offset="903502">These cases were brought by identical plaintiffs in two actions in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.482" offset="937253">The plaintiffs that are before this Court include the Village of Bellwood and Illinois Municipal Corporation and six individuals, four of whom are white and all residents of Bellwood and two blacks, one of whom is a resident of Bellwood and one a resident of another municipality.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.840" offset="1006738">The defendants in the first case include Gladstone Realtors, a real estate brokerage firm in Illinois and six of its sales people.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.122" offset="1035891">The second case involves Robert A Hintze, a sole proprietorship, the owner of that firm and two of his sales people.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.071" offset="1067656">The plaintiffs allege in their complaints that the defendants had engaged in illegal racial steering and the defendants are charged that they undertook efforts to influence the choice of perspective home buyers on the basis of race and discouraged prospective black home buyers from purchasing homes in white areas on the basis of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.239" offset="1160338">Jurisdiction is posited in part upon Section 3612 of articles or Title 42.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.040" offset="1187506">In the complaints, the plaintiffs sought declaratory release, injunctive relief, and over $300,000 in damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.519" offset="1225435">The injury that was alleged to have been sustained by the Village of Bellwood was that its housing market had been wrongfully and illegally manipulated to the economic and social determent of the citizens of such village.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.596" offset="1277785">The individual plaintiffs base their injury on two different theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.422" offset="1297011">The first theory was that the individual plaintiffs had been denied their right to select housing without regard to race.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.845" offset="1326791">The second theory they claim that they had been deprived of the social and professional benefits of living in an integrated society.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.205" offset="1364198">Pursuant to discovery and as a result of discovery request made by the defendants, the individual plaintiffs admitted that none of them had ever intended during the period at issue to purchase or rent a home in Bellwood or to purchase or rent a home through the services of any of the defendants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.733" offset="1442356">Based upon that discovery, the defendants proceeded to file a motion for a summary judgment in both cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.928" offset="1475062">The plaintiffs, it was contended, had not set forth a cause of action under Sections 1982, 3604 or 3612 and alternatively that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate the existence of a case of controversy under Article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.488" offset="1549354">Subsequently, Judge Decker in the Gladstone case held and ruled in favor of the motion and held that the individual plaintiffs were only testers and not bona fide homeseekers and therefore could not be denied the right to select housing without regard to race.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.394" offset="1612988">At most, Judge Decker found that the individual plaintiffs had suffered was the indirect or generalized injury of being denied the benefits of living in an integrated society.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.617" offset="1657814">Judge Decker relied in large part upon the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in TOPIC versus Circle Realty.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.599" offset="1685817">In that case, the Ninth Circuit had held that a cause of action under Section 3612 exists only for a direct victim of a prescribed practice under Section 3604.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.498" offset="1741406">The court went on to hold that the Village of Bellwood had not suffered any cognizable injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.927" offset="1763035">Subsequently, Judge Perry in the Hintze case adopted Judge Decker’s decision and the case went on appeal to the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.762" offset="1794382">There the Seventh Circuit found that the individual plaintiffs themselves had not been denied the right to purchase or rent housing without regard to race, because the plaintiffs did not possess a good faith interest to enter into the housing market and the plaintiffs’ allegations to the contrary in the complaint had been foreclosed by their admissions through the discovery process.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.503" offset="1889364">Therefore, testers qua testers did not have a cause of action.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="450.381" offset="1904933">Mr. Howe, was there a cross-petition for certiorari from that portion of the judgment of the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jonathan_t_howe" startTime="457.669" stopTime="626.625">

            <text syncTime="457.669" offset="1934085">No sir, there was not, no cross-petition has been filed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.567" offset="1957595">The Seventh Circuit went on however to hold that the plaintiffs claim that they had been denied the right to live in an integrated society, was cognizable under Section 3604 and 3612.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.362" offset="2016841">The court made no decision as to the claims under Section 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.226" offset="2036276">The Seventh Circuit, it is our position, erroneously relied upon the decision of this Court in Trafficante versus Metropolitan Life Insurance, where this Court held under Section 3610 that residents of an apartment complex could complain that their landlord’s rental practices deprived them of the social and professional benefits of living in an integrated community.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.800" offset="2138572">The Seventh Circuit while noting that Trafficante was not technically controlling, felt that its thrust and its rational suggests that individual plaintiffs have standing to allege deprivation of a right to live in an integrated society under Section 3612.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.586" offset="2205759">The Court specifically rejected the decision of the Ninth Circuit in the TOPIC case.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.089" offset="2223731">As to the Village, the court went on to find without any allegations in the complaint to support the conclusion that it was apparent that the concrete injury with a substantial nexus to the Village’s status as a unit of government could be proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.106" offset="2291754">Based upon that decision of the Seventh Circuit, this writ was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.153" offset="2315995">It is the position of the petitioners and the defendants that Section 3612 does not authorize the filing in a United States District Court of a cause of action by the same class of plaintiffs as would be permitted to file a cause of action after the exhaustion of the administrative remedies under Section 3610.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.738" offset="2418291">Section 3612 provides that the rights granted by Section 3604 may be enforced in an appropriate United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.886" offset="2462908">Thus 3612, it is our position, limits the rights that can be enforced to those under 3604. 3604 provides five distinct categories of rights and practices which it declares to be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.016" offset="2527483">Not one of those five categories includes a right or generalized interest to live in an integrated society, nor do any of the five categories provide any generalized right or interest to protect the economic and social interests of citizens for manipulation by racial steering.</text>

            <text syncTime="626.625" offset="2609821">Mr. Howe, you do concede, I guess, don't you that the practices alleged by -- that were carried on by the realtors in this case known colloquially at least as racial steering were violative of the substantive provisions of the Act?</text>

            <text syncTime="694.390" offset="2880972">That is correct, that is correct Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.894" offset="2898944">We also note that 3612 by limiting access to the federal courts to those five categories is part of a broader base of the entire statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.137" offset="2951920">We must look at the entire Fair Housing Act to determine and to see whether the Sections as defined by Congress provide a harmonious hope.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.531" offset="2993507">The Seventh Circuit disregarded this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.737" offset="3002284">It did not even address it.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.585" offset="3009703">It is our suggestion in our argument that we must compare Section 3610 with 3612 and we must read them together.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.937" offset="3047111">Now, Section 3610 addresses itself to the concept of injury sustained as a result of housing discrimination by a person aggrieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.207" offset="3092250">In Warth versus Seldin, this Court characterized the decision in Trafficante and Section 3610 as giving residence of housing facilities and actionable right to be free from adverse consequences to them of racially discriminatory practices directed at and immediately harmful to others, because they were persons aggrieved, which is a term of art we submit, to give broader opportunities to a class of claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.641" offset="3205935">3612, as noted, addresses itself to rights, not to injury. Purely for the sake of example, this Court has held in several cases that even if a person is injured as a result of an invasion of a constitutional right of another person, that injured person cannot seek redress of the constitutional rights of an absent third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.406" offset="3308962">In fact in the (Inaudible) decision and stated that the established principle is that suspension of the product of a Fourth Amendment violation can be successfully urged only by those whose rights were violated by the search itself, not by those who are aggrieved solely by the introduction of the damaging evidence and thus 3610 does provide a cause of action however to these people who have sustained some injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.418" offset="3417004">They are persons aggrieved and consistent with the decision in Trafficante, which does provide for the concept of the private attorney general.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.467" offset="3449292">we have to look at this word of art of person aggrieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.765" offset="3462457">It does have significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.886" offset="3470921">Congress has used that terminology only when it has wanted to expand the jurisdiction of courts to hear claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.830" offset="3506657">It has a well defined meaning in the case law of this country and as Trafficante shows, the concept is to extend the broadest and possible standing under Article III for the injury sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.460" offset="3557230">We do not need to look at the legislative history for the Fair Housing Act in this case, because as this Court stated in the Kepner case, it is a well settled rule that the construction of language in a statute which has a well settled and well known meaning sanctioned by judicial decision is presumed –</text>

            <text syncTime="2090.846" offset="8466787">Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.891" offset="8482983">We would like to cover four main topics in our discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.456" offset="8501164">First that the individuals here, the individual home owners are very much individual people who have been injured and are being injured and it is an immediate injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.456" offset="8553200">Secondly that the Village is suing to protect the village fisk and that is an immediate and a very much felt injury right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.247" offset="8596355">That the legislative history shows that these two Sections 3610 and 3612 are alternative methods of enforcement, and finally the Trafficante is very applicable to this situation and that the injury here indicates an even more stronger situation of injury to individuals in taking away rights guaranteed under 3604.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.009" offset="8711398">The homeowners Mr. Powell and the others, Mr. Powell happens to be white, found that there was steering going on in the Village of Bellwood and that the impact was to create fear and problems and so they tried to do something about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.782" offset="8770539">And Mr. Powell wanted to live in Bellwood in an integrated society, in integrated schools, in a normal stable kind of situation and he wanted to do something about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.838" offset="8814738">So he went to the village and he went to the Leadership Council, a fair housing group in Chicago to work on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.583" offset="8841697">Ms. Perry is black and she lives in Bellwood and she wanted to continue to live in this community, which was a normal integrated community and she wanted it to stay that way where her children could live and deal with people of the same kind of living situation on a normal basis and to have a healthy real estate market free from fear and constant pressure by the real estate community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.341" offset="8952769">At the same time, the village here received complaints of the Mayor's office and the police department of real estate people out steering in the neighborhoods and creating fear and problems among the people in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.967" offset="9015254">And the Village Board voted to ask for help from a fair housing organization, the Leadership Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.315" offset="9040645">Some of the plaintiffs and other people then went out to find out what the practices were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.755" offset="9066350">What they found out was that when a white person went in and asked for a certain kind of housing at a certain value, they were sent to certain areas considered to be protected and set aside for whites, when blacks went out and gave the same kind of information, we want a $45,000 house or whatever the figure was, so many bedrooms and so forth, they were steered mainly to two particular areas where they were trying to change the area from white to black.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.500" offset="9189334">The village after seeing this information from the audits, both from the people who are plaintiffs in this case as well as other testers or auditors or investigators or whatever they may be called, the village then voted to take action in the federal district court and requested again assistance in filing that case in the federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.239" offset="9272299">They sought direct relief under 3612 and this was an immediate problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.016" offset="9291421">This was something that had to be solved quickly and it is something that had to be done and get into court right away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.274" offset="9316498">And they sought that 3612 remedy because among other things under 3614, there is a provision that these cases are supposed to be expedited, and in many cases they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.162" offset="9364041">Defendants here acknowledged that there is a violation of 3604 (a) and that they think that a plaintiff, a person who is affected by violation of the Fair Housing Act must under these circumstances go through the route of going to HUD and the administrative process and only after that could they sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.020" offset="9443453">That seems to indicate that they see and in fact they say, they see a system here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.197" offset="9468113">Well clearly, if the Congress meant to have that kind of a system, they could have followed the Title VII approach and they did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.779" offset="9494444">Congress knew how to make that exhaustion necessary and they did not do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2587.810" offset="10454601">I think that the case is different than Trafficante in that respect that Trafficante was a particular apartment complex, although a very, very big one, and Bellwood is different because it is homeowners, it is a community itself and it is different because the villages involved trying to protect the values of the homes from being depreciated by this process and thereby limiting the tax pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.966" offset="10559195">So there are those differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.801" offset="10570585">It seems to me there is one thing that is stronger here and that is that these home owners are being damaged directly by an attempt to change the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.716" offset="10618232">In other words, change it from an integrated community to an all black community and it seems to me that, that is even a stronger injury than the situation and where in Trafficante they were trying to keep blacks out and the whites wanted to make it an open community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.730" offset="10686255">Here, the community and the municipality have worked to make it an open community and as a result of that, the real estate industry now is trying to turn on them and change it to an all black segregated community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.124" offset="10735888">So I think it is a little stronger in that regard, but it is broader than Trafficante, it includes more people.</text>

            <text syncTime="2690.613" offset="10865873">And particularly in looking at 3604, for example on advertising, clearly the people have to bring a suit to prevent that kind of advertising, 3604 (c) and 3604 (e) among other things contemplate the kind of action that is set forth here and in addition, all of the district courts and Courts of Appeals, most of the Courts of Appeals have dealt with situations where many different kinds of parties have been allowed standing under 3612, when there has been an injury as a result of a violation of the Fair Housing Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2752.053" offset="11111633">HUD is very busy and HUD is doing more and more, but it is important and the legislative history indicates that it was intended that individual people, local people, like the people in this community would have a right to act or work together to try to protect their community and do something about a problem they see as being very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.565" offset="11233677">We think that the situation here presented represents individuals and the municipality who are directly injured, who have need the activity here locally to protect their community and to try to maintain a healthy viable local community, that the legislative history supports the position that these two Acts should be enforced separately and concurrently as is necessary along with other ways of enforcing these laws is necessary and that the case should be allowed to go forward and that the proof should be allowed to come in and that the plaintiffs should be allowed to show these steering practices, to show what these realtors do, to try to change the neighborhoods with all of the things that can result from that, like the problems with the school segregation and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.245" offset="11436387">If these communities can be kept integrated and healthy schools can be maintained, the other problems of segregation can be helped and prevented by integrated communities and we respectfully request that the plaintiffs here be allowed to proceed to show these violations, to present the evidence, to do the discovery and to proceed with this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2879.830" offset="11622693">Yes Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.486" offset="11637321">The first I want to emphasize about this case is that contrary to some impressions that some may have of it; it is not in our view a case about whether testers have standing to sue under Section 812.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.049" offset="11723525">Testers do provide important evidence, particularly in racial steering cases, it is very difficult to prove racial steering in our experience in the absence of evidence of this kind and occasionally you can evidence from a former employee of the company, but by and large this has been the most prohibitive kind of evidence in steering cases, but it is just coincidental that the complainants in this case also happen to be the witnesses, the potential witnesses who have been doing the testers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.266" offset="11860407">Their interest here is an interest in the way their community has been affected by the cumulative effects of the steering practices, and its cumulative effects that the steering practices have their pugnacious effects on the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.785" offset="11946506">Insofar as the statute deals with steering, its focus is not really as an anti-fraud provision about a particular individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.079" offset="11987675">Very often the individual who has been steered, who is a willing purchaser of a home or a renter is quite satisfied with the property that he is settled into.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.291" offset="12044518">It is the cumulative effect that causes the injury to the community and the people living in the community.</text>

            <text syncTime="3013.258" offset="12156426">Now, as I understand the Court of Appeals' opinion, it held that both the city and the individual respondents had standing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3051.248" offset="12308355">So while we didn't brief the question because we thought that the case was pretty clearly controlled by Trafficante with respect to the individual complainants, we have no disagreement with the holding of the Court of Appeals or indeed with any aspect of Judge Powell’s opinion, we think it is a fine opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3076.380" offset="12408874">Let me begin by expressing my understanding with which may I ask you, if you agree that up until the enactment of this federal legislation so far as federal statutory law went, forgetting for a moment 1982, there was nothing wrong about racial steering so far as federal statutory law went.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.181" offset="12504064">Therefore any rights that are asserted by the plaintiffs in this case have to be based upon this statute, limiting again forgetting the constitution in 1982, which -- what substantive rights are these plaintiffs asserting, created by 3602 or 3 or 4 or what?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="3121.370" offset="12588805">It is 3604 or what we call Section 804 of Title VIII, 3604 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.689" offset="12622137">It's set forth quite completely in the briefs for the petitioners and our theory right along and we have brought about 80 cases of our own in the course of the Act alleging racial steering of one kind or another, has been that it is a violation of that portion of 3604 (a), which refers to or otherwise make unavailable or deny a dwelling to any person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.136" offset="12751914">The first part of 3604 (a), which includes the qualification of the bona fide offer focuses on a violation by the seller himself or the renter himself and they wanted to afford the protection to make sure there was a bona fide offer made to that individual in many instances rather than a company engaged in the business, before there would be a violation of that kind, but the remainder obviously has principal reference to people engaged in the real estate business or to big renters of property.</text>

            <text syncTime="3250.216" offset="13104253">It is very similar to the right asserted by the plaintiffs in the Trafficante case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.024" offset="13135496">There was as the Court noted in its opinion in Trafficante, considerable focus in the legislative history on the dangers to the community of discriminatory practices in housing and the benefits to all members of the community with adherence to the requirements that were being proposed in the Fair Housing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.416" offset="13245001">And one of the telling things about steering case is and we reviewed every decided case yesterday rather hastily, every decided case under Title VIII, one of the telling things is that we did not find a single instance of a case in which an individual had sued solely because he had been steered and claimed an injury as a result of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.216" offset="13376240">There were a few cases in which an individual claimed that he was illegally denied access to a particular house that he wanted to buy or a particular apartment that he wanted to go into and was seeking that and additionally alleged that there was steering done.</text>

            <text syncTime="3379.032" offset="13619493">Well, here there were areas where steering of customers by the real estate companies was done on the basis of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.644" offset="13657945">But what we have found is that the cases where private suits have been brought alleging steering and attempting to enjoying the steering or claiming damages from steering have typically been cases by community fair housing organizations where the plaintiffs would be a number of individuals who have banded together because of the effect the steering has had on their community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.658" offset="13774033">And it may well be that some of these plaintiffs have actually dealt with these companies and being steered themselves, which you do not ordinarily see that alleged in the complaint because it is very difficult for them to prove what was available that they were not shown in the absence of the testing evidence, which is something gathered separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.385" offset="13860864">And in other words, if you have someone who was himself a victim of steering as a plaintiff from one of these cases, it is more or less coincidental and it is his similarity to other plaintiffs that we have in this case that is his real motivation for being a plaintiff rather than the difference, which he does not even allege typically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.146" offset="13955950">So that tells us something about what it is as the incentive to sue here and that has something to do with realistically where the standing should be recognized.</text>

            <text syncTime="3564.529" offset="14361475">Now as a matter of fact, as Mr. Justice White was suggesting early in the argument, there were claims made under Section 812 in Trafficante, which is the Section that the suit has been brought under here and indeed there were complainants in Trafficante, complainants in intervention who had not exhausted their administrative remedies with HUD, who would not complain to HUD at all and the sole basis for their suit in intervention was Section 812.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.544" offset="14533569">And there is significance in our view to the statement that he quoted from page 409 of the opinion that individuals could sue directly under Section 812 because those were among the complainants who were seeking not only injunctive relief, but they also made damage claims and on remand, the case was settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.644" offset="14633984">But the District Court and everyone else thought that their claims had been upheld along with the claims of the two tenants who had first gone to HUD and were suing under Section 810.</text>

            <text syncTime="4005.255" offset="16124426">As we point out in our brief, it has been HUD's consistent interpretation of the statute that the alternative remedies are available for any person aggrieved within the meaning of 810, and at every step in the process, their notifications to individuals who have complained to them include a statement that they have a right to sue under Section 812.</text>
            <text syncTime="4031.258" offset="16228394">And indeed, there is much in the legislation evolution of the two provisions, which suggests that this is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4041.652" offset="16269981">All of the resistance to the fair housing legislation and there was a great deal of resistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.744" offset="16302373">One of the main focal points was on the idea of the federal bureaucrats becoming involved and indeed the deferral, the main motivation behind the deferral that was required to local fair housing officials was that the federal bureaucracy should not be interfering in areas where local conciliation and mediation efforts are available, which suggests that quite the opposite of what is being argued today that the deferral should take place in the absence of HUD’s involvement, rather than as the statute focuses it in the presence of HUD's involvement, it is HUD itself that is supposed to defer of these processes.</text>

            <text syncTime="4169.184" offset="16780100">[Attempt to Laughter] Well, we did recount there in some rather lengthy textual footnotes, the immediate derivation of Section 812.</text>
            <text syncTime="4184.680" offset="16842062">And this is principally in footnote 8 of that brief and in footnote 12 of that brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4191.897" offset="16871006">In footnote 8, we pointed out that Section 810 itself was derived from Section 11 of a Bill which Senator Mondale had offered as an amendment to a house bill, the house bill that came over at this time in 1968, this is after two years of previous history that we recounted in some detail in our present brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4219.864" offset="16982810">The Bill that came over at that time from the house did not include any fair housing provisions at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4226.339" offset="17008724">And Senator Mondale offered as an amendment a Bill that included a provision similar to Section 810, but it also included authority for HUD issue cease and desist orders that would be enforceable in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4251.034" offset="17107466">And it was the cease and desist authority, something similar to the way the National Labor Relations Board operates, that was the focal point of controversy and that resulted in the failure of a number of cloture motions, which we have recounted in that footnote 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="4271.710" offset="17190222">And at that point, after these cloture motions had failed, Senator Mondale moved to table his proposed amendment and supported a substitute amendment offered by Senator Dirksen, which is the one that was adopted and later was adopted by the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="4298.253" offset="17296384">And this retained the Section 810 mechanism for making an administrative complaint, but took the authority to issue cease and desist orders away from HUD and in its place substituted Section 812 an alternative to go directly into state or federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4319.376" offset="17380916">And as we argued then in our footnote 12 in that brief, because there were after all two complainants in that case, who were complaining only under Section 812, there is no reason to think that the failure to repeat the definition of person aggrieved in Section 812 made any change in the class of complainants who were authorized to pursue either of the remedies, because Section 812 was designed as a substitute for the cease and desist remedy that had originally been proposed for the class of persons aggrieved, defined in what had been Section 11 of Senator Mondale's bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="4366.311" offset="17568580">There was nothing in this immediate evolution of the alternative remedy that suggests any notion of a different class of complainants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4376.626" offset="17609853">It was a way to ameliorate the objections to a federal administrative remedy for the class of complainants that both proposals were designed to give a right of action too.</text>
            <text syncTime="4395.667" offset="17686026">And so the additional aspects of the legislative history, which we have recounted in our present brief indicate that the rational hypothesis by the Ninth Circuit and it was entirely hypothesis, there were no references at all to the legislative history in the TOPIC opinion, that those do not comport at all with the actual evolution of the provisions at issue or the congressional intention, which was as has been the practice that it is really the administrative remedy that provides the inexpensive quick road to relief in many instances and the judicial remedy was not reserved for a special class of cases that had to be more expeditiously handled.</text>
            <text syncTime="4452.187" offset="17912142">Our experience is that the hope for expedition in Section 812 and Section 813 cases are often does not come to pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="4468.971" offset="17979225">And so, we really think that this case is in every pertinent respect no different from Trafficante.</text>
            <text syncTime="4479.241" offset="18020289">It is true that you have a wider geographic area that these people are concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4487.408" offset="18052995">They do not happen to be people living in apartment complex.</text>

            <text syncTime="4500.182" offset="18104090">And as Judge Stern, I think very eloquently stated in a case in New Jersey that is cited in the briefs, Fair Housing Council against Eastern Bergen County, the fact that the alleged injury and I am quoting from Judge Stern now, affects a large number of people in a large geographic area does not serve to attenuate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4524.667" offset="18201997">On the contrary, it makes the harm more severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="4529.561" offset="18221641">Residents of an all white housing complex may need only to look to the next residential facility for the inter-racial associations they desire.</text>
            <text syncTime="4538.591" offset="18257690">If the allegations here are true, residents of Bergen County may have to go to an entirely different neighborhood or community.</text>
            <text syncTime="4546.618" offset="18289873">Similarly, a completely white building is less of a ghetto than a completely white neighborhood or a community, that the court on the Sanitaire has been drawn around an entire community rather than a single apartment complex does not render it unlawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="4832.872" offset="19434872">Much has been said about the Trafficante decision in this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4836.465" offset="19449187">I think the Court's attention should be directed to page 212 of the opinion wherein the Court stated, we reverse and remand the case to the District Court leaving untouched all other questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="4886.584" offset="19649703">One other fact which is extremely important in the Trafficante decision is that the action was brought against a single landlord who alone controlled access to that apartment complex.</text>

            <text syncTime="4912.315" offset="19752626">It could Your Honor, but I think that the fact that we like to point out is that there is a distinction between the class of defendants in Trafficante as to the class of defendant in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.805" offset="19810617">The concept of the public policy argument as advanced by the United States, no showing has been made that by opening an opportunity under Section 3612 to indirect victims that the policy of the Fair Housing Act would be advanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="4943.931" offset="19879058">And we would submit that it would be to the contrary because it would provide a mechanism by which the entire metrics of an administrative remedy through Section 3610 could be avoided and circumvented.</text>
            <text syncTime="4958.231" offset="19936319">We think that the language of Section 3610 of person aggrieved is unique and the failure of Congress to include that language specifically in Section 3612 indicated a different view by Congress and we need to only look at the natural meaning of the words contained in the statute to go forward with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4978.300" offset="20016567">The fact that the attorney general's office lacked staff is no reason for this Court to make any consideration as to how it is going to interpret a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4987.068" offset="20051675">It must do that solely and exclusively on the basis of what is contained in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4992.582" offset="20073723">We submit that we know of no other statute in the United States that would allow the systematic circumvention of remedies, if this court is to adopt the position that has been advanced by the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5006.627" offset="20129834">It is necessary to confine an actionable claim within the limits of the language used by Congress and consistent with the logic that is embodied in that statutory scheme rather than allowing it to extend beyond the intentions of Congress.</text>
