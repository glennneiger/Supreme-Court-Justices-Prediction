            <text syncTime="143.132" offset="677972">This case involves a challenge to an employment policy of the New York City Transit Authority, which excludes from employment heroin addicts participating in methadone maintenance programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.886" offset="728963">The District Court found this policy to be an unconstitutional denial of the equal protection of the laws to methadone patients and found further that the policy had a disparate impact on Blacks and Hispanics in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended in 1972 to apply to government agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.381" offset="834915">The Second Circuit affirmed the finding of unconstitutionality and declined to rule on the Title VII question finding it unnecessary to do so.</text>

            <label>Ms. Joan Offner</label>
            <text syncTime="365.414" offset="1567075">Well, the District Court specified motorman, conductor, bus operator and positions dealing with power equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.162" offset="1614096">I suggest however Mr. Chief Justice that the District Court exceeded its boundaries in reaching that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.420" offset="1655056">In the first place the District Court had to make a finding of unconstitutionality in order to reach the point of addressing itself to what or to be a rational policy for the Transit Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.133" offset="1713988">The Transit Authority's contention is that its policy has a rational relationship to a legitimate need and that the constitution does not impose on employers an obligation to participate in what amounts to a sociological experiment.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.900" offset="1804999">The Transit Authority's refusal to employ methadone patients is based on a variety of considerations, all of which are supported by the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.140" offset="1841988">In the first place the Authority is involved in a very difficult and demanding job of providing subway and bus transportation to the people of the city of New York on a vast scale, transporting something like two billion passengers over the course of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.363" offset="1918892">It is our considered view that the responsibilities involved in that operation require us to employ people in all job categories, who meet at least reasonable standards of reliability and stability.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.989" offset="1981377">And those considerations, taken together with the uncertainties and the failures of methadone treatment and the difficulties of determining the employability of methadone patients form the basis and the underpinning for the Authority's policy and I think its appropriate to note in this connection that this Court in Marshall against The United States expressed the very same concerns about the state of drug rehabilitation programs, the validity, the uncertainty and interestingly enough Marshall against the United States was decided in the very same year as the trial that was conducted in this case, 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.986" offset="2165384">The record in this case contains the testimony of a number of medical experts, most of whom were proponents of methadone maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.808" offset="2204672">At the same time that they were extolling the virtues of methadone maintenance as the treatment for heroin addiction, they nevertheless were constrained to admit that there was and is substantial drug and alcohol abuse among methadone patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.280" offset="2270501">They testified to the disruptive behavior of many patients at the clinics to the black market that exists in methadone with patients selling their take-home doses on the street, and most importantly to the issue in this case, they testified to the fact that methadone as a treatment for heroin addiction works sometimes.</text>

            <text syncTime="631.522" offset="2631513">The Transit Authority's Executive Office for Labor Relations testified that the Transit Authority indeed will categorically exclude from employment current methadone users and people who are relatively recent methadone users, but that the Authority would give individual consideration to people, who have been totally drug-free for a period of at least five years and can demonstrate that they are maintaining a stable existence in terms of jobs, in terms of family life, in terms of their social obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.550" offset="2775604">The District Court's opinion in two places that I can recall indicated that they were sure that the Transit Authority's policy extends as far back as relatively recent methadone users, but that it was not clear as to what the policy was with regard to people who are totally drug-free for a substantial period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.299" offset="2878631">Now it is our contention that the record is clear because we have the testimony, un-controverted testimony of our Executive Officer with regard to that policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="834.504" offset="3443399">The essence of my argument with regard to what the District Court did here is that the District Court misunderstood the rational basis test.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.753" offset="3488434">For the most part, I'm not challenging what the District Court found.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.493" offset="3503376">They found no more than that called substantial numbers of heroin addicts are helped to a stable condition by methadone.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.738" offset="3544336">The essence of my argument is that that is not enough to establish a finding of unconstitutionality under a proper application of the rational basis test.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.835" offset="3608806">The uncertainties of methadone treatment are compounded by the difficulty of ascertaining the employability of individual methadone patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.399" offset="3663036">The experts were generally in agreement that when a methadone patient applies for job, he presents a special problem to the employer and that the employer needs some assistance in evaluating this individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.707" offset="3724267">The question is where that assistance is to come from.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.980" offset="3741299">A number of the experts were frankly skeptical about the validity and usefulness of information that the employer might obtain from the personnel at the methadone clinic.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.663" offset="3800022">On the average there is one doctor for every 200 methadone patients at a public methadone clinic, so that by in large evaluations of the patient's progress in treatment is coming from non-professional counselor personnel of the methadone clinics, who as the experts indicated very considerably in their competence and in their reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.465" offset="3935232">This problem is further compounded by Federal confidentiality regulations, which provide that even if there is consent by the patient, the methadone clinic cannot disclose information -- specific information about the patient's condition to an employer unless the employer makes a commitment that he will not or that it will not use the information adversely to the patient's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.595" offset="4067830">It is almost a catch-22 situation where the employer will not be given specific information about the patient unless the employer makes the commitment not to use the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.989" offset="4109416">The idea is that the employer is supposed to use the information to make an effort to rehabilitate the patient, which is all well and good but the employer as we see it has other obligations and that is to keep the subway system running.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.021" offset="4229475">The classification in this case does not involve any fundamental interest as that term has been defined by this Court nor does it involve any suspect category as enumerated by the Court; race, national origin, alienage, in some instance is wealth, not does it involve immutable characteristics of birth such as those inherent in sex classifications and classifications of illegitimacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.380" offset="4358938">The group characteristic in this case consists of a self-inflicted heroin addiction and methadone maintenance and that being so there is no dispute among the parties that the proper test to be applied in the Equal Protection analysis is the rational basis standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.163" offset="4462070">That standard as clarified by this Court in recent years gives to the Transit Authority policy a presumption of validity, doesn't require individualized consideration, approves the use of broad classifications as long as those classifications are rationally related to legitimate objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.730" offset="4564365">Contrasted with that standard, of course is the strict scrutiny standard in which there is not a presumption of legitimacy in which broad classifications are not acceptable and in which the government classification must be shown to be based on a compelling need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.386" offset="4663003">What happened in this case was that both the District Court and the Circuit Court, thought they were replying or intended to apply rational basis standards, but took their instruction from cases that dealt with the strict scrutiny standard, specifically Sugarman against Dougall and LaFleur against Clevenland School Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.775" offset="4756522">As a result they misunderstood the rational basis standard and in effect viewed the evidence in this case through the wrong end of the telescope.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.705" offset="4796228">They focused their attention on the minority of methadone patients who become stabilized and did not deal with the fact that the majority of methadone patients do not become stabilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.404" offset="4862997">Influenced by the strict scrutiny standard, both of the lower courts decided that the Transit Authority policy was overly broad and that the Equal Protection Clause required a more individualized approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.582" offset="4927781">We submit that under a proper rational basis analysis, the operative fact in this case is not that some methadone patients may become employable, but that most of them do not; and added to that of course is the difficulty of determining employability in individual situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.589" offset="5003745">We submit therefore that there is ample evidence to support the policy of the Transit Authority and the absence of the invidious discrimination necessary for finding of unconstitutionality under the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.102" offset="5065812">I would like to turn now to the Title VII question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.590" offset="5087754">Several months after finding an equal protection violation, the district court rendered a supplemental decision in which it found that the policy of the authority had a disparate impact on Blacks and Hispanics, and therefore violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.983" offset="5169361">I submit to this Court that the district court decision totally distorts the concept of disparate impact as established in Griggs against Duke Power and as carried forward in Albemarle against Moody and most recently I think in Dothard against Rawlinson.</text>

            <text syncTime="1372.016" offset="5593485">I would just like to say very briefly on the Title VII question that as I understand the disparate impact cases which this Court has decided, each of those cases involved an actual absence, significant absence of minorities from the particular employer's workforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.171" offset="5666105">And that absence existing, the court then looked to the particular challenged employment policy to determine whether that policy was where the fault lay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.740" offset="5716365">In our case, no such absence exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.517" offset="5731516">In fact, the Transit Authority's employment pattern includes 46% Blacks and Hispanics against a profile in the relevant labor pool of 20% Blacks and Hispanics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.216" offset="5806331">So we have more than double the percentage of minorities in the Authority's workforce, then are represented in the Metropolitan area workforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.501" offset="5871428">And the respondents have suggested that this Court should dismiss this case on the basis of a newly enacted amendment to the Rehabilitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.120" offset="5917926">This new amendment provides in general terms for inclusion of rehabilitated drug addicts and alcoholics as handicap persons under the Rehabilitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.906" offset="5965051">The amendment does not expressly apply to methadone patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.849" offset="5988770">It is our contention that any attempts to include methadone patients within the category of protected persons would be certain to result in litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.404" offset="6035059">As a practical matter what the respondents are asking this Court to do is to interpret the scope of this new statute which has not yet began to be implemented and applied retroactively to the Transit Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.191" offset="6090230">They are asking the Court to sanction the enormous equitable and monetary liability imposed on the Transit Authority in this case on the basis of the statute which was not enacted until four years after the trial of this action and as I say which has not yet even began to the be implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.280" offset="6178523">Finally and perhaps most important, they are asking this Court to interpret the scope of this new statute and to establish a precedent in this case which will undoubtedly have a compelling influence on the shape of any future litigation under the Rehabilitation Act.</text>
