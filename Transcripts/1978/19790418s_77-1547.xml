            <text syncTime="7.403" offset="29571">The first of these, 77-1547, Douglas Oil against Petrol Stops is a case here on certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.774" offset="83069">It involves a question as to when and by whom transcripts of the grand jury investigation maybe made available to parties in a collateral civil proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.430" offset="133642">The issue was complicated because the grand jury set in a District Court in Los Angeles and a civil litigation within a District Court in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.160" offset="176588">As the defendant in the civil suit had been implicated in the grand jury investigation, it already possessed copies of the transcripts desired by the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.646" offset="226534">The questions presented to the Los Angeles District Court included the broad policy question whether the need for disclosure was greater than the need for grand jury secrecy and also whether the plaintiff in the Arizona case was requesting only those portions of the transcripts that were in fact relevant to that proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.909" offset="331546">As we think the Arizona court conducting the civil proceedings was in a better position than the Los Angeles court to determine the relevancy and need for the transcripts.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.584" offset="382328">It was error for the latter court to have ordered that delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.332" offset="401241">As this order was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, we now reverse that decision. Our reasons are set forth in the court's opinion filed today with the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.928" offset="455680">Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.462" offset="469786">Mr. Justice Stevens had dissented in an opinion in which the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Stewart have joined.</text>
