            <text syncTime="18.037" offset="175522">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.979" offset="191300">This case involves a challenge to the procedures employed by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare in recovering overpayments to the beneficiaries of social security, old age, survivors, and disability insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.027" offset="251486">The principal question presented is whether a beneficiary is entitled to an evidentiary hearing before, rather than after, his monthly benefits are reduced to recover a previous overpayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.538" offset="305507">The case is here for the second time on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.981" offset="331316">In 1976, in response to the Secretary's petition for review, this Court vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remanded for reconsideration in light of the decision in Mathews against Eldridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.583" offset="381680">The Court of Appeals adhered to its initial result and the Secretary, again, sought certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.524" offset="405504">There were two suits consolidated in the Court of Appeals: One, from the Western District of Washington, Buffington case and, the other, from the District of Hawaii, Elliot.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.822" offset="442702">Buffington is a nationwide class action on behalf of recipients of old age and survivors benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.262" offset="480423">Elliot is limited to persons living in Hawaii but it includes disability beneficiaries as well as old age beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.191" offset="524100">The procedures attacked by respondents begin with the Secretary's determination that an overpayment has occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.040" offset="555551">In many cases, this determination is based on an annual earnings report filed by the beneficiary himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.396" offset="584913">Other times, the initial determination is based on the Secretary's independent discovery of some administrative error or a fact or event that affects a recipient's continuing eligibility for benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.040" offset="647502">When the Secretary concludes that an overpayment has occurred, he notifies the beneficiary of his determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.692" offset="678118">Respondents' complaints in the District Courts challenge the adequacy of the notice provided, and the District Courts ordered that the Secretary provide a more detailed information about the reasons for the overpayment and the availability of administrative review.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.528" offset="741439">The Court of Appeals affirmed and the Secretary did not seek further review of this aspect of the Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.312" offset="768606">Instead, he has developed more elaborate notice forms that the Social Security Administration is now using in notifying beneficiaries that they've received overpayments.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.088" offset="811760">There's apparently still some squabbling in the Court of Appeals over whether the new forms comply with the Court of Appeals' decision, but that question is not presented here.</text>

            <text syncTime="229.225" offset="1020322">The notice also informs the beneficiary of the Secretary's proposed method of recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.290" offset="1044564">The date of the first monthly payment to be reduced at the amount of the reduction, and the month in which full benefits will be resumed after the overpayment has been recovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.627" offset="1085837">In addition, the beneficiary is told that his right to request reconsideration of the overpayment determination or waiver of recovery or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.895" offset="1122931">And, standards for waiver are set forth in the notice and the procedures for requesting reconsideration or waiver are described.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.935" offset="1151143">They are-- the notice identifies the forms that must be completed in connection with an application for reconsideration or waiver, and volunteers the assistance of employees at local Social Security Offices in filling out the forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.639" offset="1209971">Finally, the beneficiary is advised that if he does request reconsideration or waiver within 30 days, his benefits will not be reduced until after the Secretary has acted on his request.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.903" offset="1255006">Even if no request is made within 30 days of the notice, a reconsideration request made within two months or a waiver request whenever made halts the reduction of benefits and results in the resumption of full benefits until after the Secretary has acted on the request.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.289" offset="1324492">The statutory provision that gives rise to all these procedures is Section 204 of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.535" offset="1349465">Section 204 (a) provides that whenever the Secretary find that more than the correct amount of payment has been made, proper adjustment or recovery shall be made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, but Section 203 (b) adds a qualification.</text>

            <text syncTime="1171.757" offset="4790418">If the beneficiary does not wish to request either of those forms of administrative relief but, instead, is willing to allow the overpayment to be recovered, then the Secretary goes ahead.</text>

            <text syncTime="1237.284" offset="5052479">Goldberg is the only case in which this Court has held that the Due Process Clause requires an evidentiary hearing before an interruption in government payments.</text>

            <text syncTime="1252.839" offset="5114755">The disputed benefits there were granted on the basis of need and, by definition, they were the only means by which the recipients could pay for food and clothing, shelter and medical care.</text>

            <text syncTime="1339.315" offset="5460616">In addition, the deprivation here is not as serious as the one in Goldberg because it only involves a reduction in the amount of benefits, not a complete termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.078" offset="5495724">The only time in which benefits will be completely terminated under the Secretary's overpayment recovery program is when the beneficiary was at fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.527" offset="5549432">I mean, when the overpayment was received as the result of fraud or when the beneficiary has sufficient income that his entire Social Security check can be withheld and he will still be able to meet current expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.916" offset="5599065">In no other situation under the Secretary's program will all the benefits be withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.627" offset="5629889">Finally, the third factor that the Eldridge Court addressed was the government's interest in the efficient functioning of its program and the administrative burden that additional procedures would entail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.407" offset="5689031">It's difficult to make precise predictions about the amount of cost that would be involved in the kind of evidentiary hearing requested by respondents, but the Court in Eldridge said that the additional cost were likely to be substantial and any time the additional procedures were required, and I think that that is equally valid here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.370" offset="5776802">We've cited in our brief several of the ways in which the requirements of the Court of Appeals decision could -- will affect the Social Security Program.</text>

            <text syncTime="1446.669" offset="5890069">The-- out of the one-and-a quarter million overpayments each year, there are only approximately 40,000 people who asked for reconsideration or waiver.</text>
