            <text syncTime="15.511" offset="61962">These cases are here on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.802" offset="91115">The First National Bank of Omaha, Nebraska is a national bank chartered in Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.671" offset="126642">It's also enrolled in the BankAmericard plan and includes among its customers under that plan a number of cardholders who are residents of the adjoining State of Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.267" offset="201038">The rate of interest permitted to be charged to cardholders under Nebraska law is 18% on unpaid balances.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.986" offset="259866">Under Minnesota law, it's 12%.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.624" offset="282436">The Supreme Court of Minnesota held that this Omaha and Nebraska Bank could charge resident cardholders in Minnesota, the 18% rate and is not limited to the 12% rate authorized by Minnesota law.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.700" offset="370730">The Minnesota Supreme Court reached that conclusion on the ground that as a national bank, the Omaha Bank is a federal instrumentality whose interest rate for its BankAmericard program is governed by federal law, and federal law, the National Bank Act, 12 United States Code Section 85, authorizes a national bank to charge interests on any loan at the rate allowed by the laws of the State where the bank is and the word of the statute is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.326" offset="517224">The Minnesota Supreme Court held that the Omaha Bank for the purposes of the statute was located in Nebraska, therefore, authorize the charge in Nebraska 18% rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.939" offset="575739">We agree and unanimously affirm the judgment of the Minnesota Supreme Court.</text>
