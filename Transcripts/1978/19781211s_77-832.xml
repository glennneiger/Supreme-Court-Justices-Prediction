            <text syncTime="10.205" offset="40751">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.406" offset="61544">The issue is whether the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 allows the Federal Reserve Board to deny approval of certain transactions that would not weaken the financial condition of a holding company or a subsidiary bank but would produce a financially unsound bank holding company.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.058" offset="152137">The First Lincolnwood Corporation was organized to serve as a bank holding company.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.018" offset="180036">The organizers proposed to exchange the shares of the company for their shares of the First National Bank of Lincolnwood and to have the holding company assume a debt they had previously incurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.991" offset="235938">The purpose of this reorganization was to enable the holding company and the bank to realize substantial tax savings.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.747" offset="278988">The Board disapproved the proposed transaction finding that the holding company and the bank did not meet its standards of financial soundness.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.897" offset="323500">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed in an en banc decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.624" offset="350459">The Court held that although the Board could approve its base, its decision solely on financial factors, it must approve a transaction that did not compound the acquired bank financial difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.045" offset="416078">By an opinion filed today with the clerk, we hold that the Board's actions were within its statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.809" offset="447216">Both the language and the legislative history of the statute support the Board's interpretation of the Bank Holding Company Act as an authorization to deny application solely on grounds of financial soundness or unsoundness.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.656" offset="518583">Further, nothing in the language of the legislative history of this Act requires a Board to approve transactions merely because they would not weaken a subsidiary bank's financial condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.130" offset="572500">The Board's exercise of its authority to prevent the formation of financially unsound bank holding company has had significant and beneficial effects on the banking system.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.372" offset="625476">The effects of which Congress has been appraised and although Congress has amended the statute, it has not sought to curtail the Board's authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.442" offset="673750">We see no basis for this Court to act where Congress has not.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.423" offset="697678">Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Rehnquist joins.</text>
