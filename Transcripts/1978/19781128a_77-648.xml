            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll hear arguments next in Federal Emergency Regulatory Commission against Pennzoil and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.012" offset="347408">Mr. Barnett, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="barnett" startTime="81.506" stopTime="400.303">
            <label>Mr. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="81.506" offset="429432">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.299" offset="452524">The principal question in this case is whether the Federal Power Commission, now the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission validly interpreted the Natural Gas Act when it held that it would be inconsistent with the Act for the Commission to approved as a just and reasonable rate above the otherwise applicable ceiling rate and for the Commission thus to pass through to interstate pipelines and hence to the consuming public incremental royalty costs based on the price of natural gas in the unregulated intrastate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.103" offset="619813">Respondents Shell and Pennzoil produced gas from a field in Southern Louisiana and sell it in interstate commerce under certificates granted by the Commission to United Gas Pipeline Company, an interstate pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.155" offset="683969">The gas is produced by Shell and Pennzoil under leases granted by the landowner lessor, Williams in 1934 and 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.046" offset="723571">The 1934 lease provides for royalty to Williams of one-eighth of the value of the gas produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.239" offset="752306">The 1952 lease provides for royalty of the one-fourth of the value of the gas produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.606" offset="777801">In each case, the value is to be calculated at the market price or the market rate prevailing at well.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.290" offset="812492">Shell and Pennzoil had always computed and paid their royalties as fractions of the market rates that they actually received by selling the gas to United, rates in which since this Court's 1954 decision in the Phillips case have been set by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.933" offset="891068">Thus in 1975, the applicable commission rates to the gas in this case were approximately 31 cents and approximately 60 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.754" offset="938402">Beginning in 1973, however, Williams demand that payment from Shell and Pennzoil of royalties based on the market value of the natural gas in the unregulated intrastate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.347" offset="996812">These values were said by Williams to range from 35 cents to 70 cents per Mcf for the period through mid 1974 and then from 1974 to 1975 from a $1.30 to $1.40 per Mcf.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.809" offset="1070582">When Shell and Pennzoil refused to pay these higher royalties, Williams purported to terminate the leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.544" offset="1097540">Shell and Pennzoil then sued Williams over this question in Louisiana state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.720" offset="1122304">Before the court made a ruling, the parties entered into a settlement agreement contingent on approval by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.622" offset="1153860">The settlement provides that Shell and Pennzoil would apply to the Commission for permission to pay specified increased royalties to Williams and to pass through these increases to United.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.467" offset="1209240">The royalties provided for in the settlement were royalties based on, that is the appropriate fraction of either a price of 78 cents per Mcf increasing 1.5 cents a year after 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.478" offset="1277262">Or based on a price of a 150% of the highest rate set by the Commission whichever was higher that is whichever the 78 cents or the 150% of the Commission rate was higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.237" offset="1336299">As an alternative, the settlement provided that Shell and Pennzoil would ask the Commission for permission to abandon the portion of the gas that was attributable to the royalty interest that is one-eighth or one-fourth so that that gas could be paid to Williams as a royalty in kind for sale by Williams, wherever Williams wanted to sell it presumably in the intrastate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.880" offset="1434937">Shell and Pennzoil then duly took this agreement to the Commission seeking its approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.475" offset="1457298">The Commission's Administrative Law Judge denied the petition for the special relief for the higher rate that would pass through this increment of royalties to the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.102" offset="1503796">The judge concluded that special relief from an area or a national rate is warranted only when a producer can demonstrate that his overall cost from the operation in question are higher than the commission ceiling or that is out of pocket expenses will exceed revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.003" offset="1575372">The judge found that Pennzoil had made no attempt to make any such cost showing and that while Shell had made such an attempt, Shell had failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.331" offset="1612675">The judge found in particular that if Shell were to pay royalties based on the 78-cent rate in the settlement, Shell will still make a profit of something like $290.00 a year, on the leases in question under the Commission's ceiling that is would not need a higher rate to make that profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.891" offset="1694908">The judge further found that even if Shell --</text>

            <text syncTime="538.690" offset="2258108">The Commission had a full hearing and considered whether it should grant the relief requested and decided that it should not because to grant it would be inconsistent with the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1207.392" offset="4932942">It is true that in Texaco, it was the entire rates of the small producers whose reasonableness was to be judged by the standard of the marketplace whereas here the royalties are only a fraction of the market price, one-fourth or one-eighth here as against the entire market price in Texaco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.174" offset="5016116">Another quantitative difference is that here again you would -- here, that in Texaco, again, you are talking about the entire price charged by the small producers whereas here the royalty increment is only a portion of the price that the producers would be charging the pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.025" offset="5107440">We submit that neither of these quantitative differences changes the applicable principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.951" offset="5127189">The second difference can be readily dismissed as a matter of law because the incremental royalty here, even though it's only an increment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.439" offset="5161148">Even though it would only be a part of the price that producer's charge the pipeline, was the entire rate that the producers are asking the Commission to approve as just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.837" offset="5202735">It was the entire incremental royalty that had to be shown to be just and reasonable and thus the Commission's refusal to find it just and reasonable and the Commission exactly said as much that it had to find the entire incremental royalty to be just and reasonable is completely consistent with Texaco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.767" offset="5270444">Now, the other difference, one-fourth and one-eighth versus the whole thing is again clearly not a difference in principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.195" offset="5300120">The Court said as much in Texaco 417 U.S. at 399 where it said “Even if the effect of increased small producer prices would make a small dent in the consumer's pocket when compared with the rates charged by large producers, the Act makes unlawful all rates which are not just and reasonable and does not say a little unlawful -- a little unlawfulness is permitted.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.757" offset="5398444">Thus, it's true of the incremental rate that the producer's wanted pass through here just as it was true of the rate in Texaco that it would be just exclusively by the market price and thus, we submit the Commission was entirely justified in relying on Texaco for its conclusion that it would be inconsistent with the Act to allow the pass through as just and reasonable rates of royalties based on the unregulated market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.306" offset="5516622">Another reason for the Commission's decision is pointed out by the effect of the Court of Appeals decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.557" offset="5557582">The decision that we asked the Court to reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.167" offset="5568031">Respondents attempt to address that decision in Sheik's Clothing and argue that it's simply a procedural issue that's at stake here seizing on the Commission's language about authority and thus for example, if Shell says in its brief, the Court of Appeals did not require the Commission of fine for the producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.908" offset="5647026">The Commission was merely required to consider the merits of the producer's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.517" offset="5665416">Well, that sounds fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.220" offset="5672208">The short answer first is that the Commission here did consider the merits of the producer's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.770" offset="5694464">It did consider whether it should grant the producers the relief they seek.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.357" offset="5712750">And it decided not to, it decided that it would not do so, it could not do so because to do so would be inconsistent with the Act as interpreted by this Court in Texaco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.388" offset="5756949">But further, the fact is that the Court of Appeals decision clearly would require the Commission to grant relief and not simply to consider doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.863" offset="5802820">The -- for example the Court of Appeals said, this is page 7 (a) in the appendix to the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.991" offset="5835316">This is not to say that every additional cost must be past through to the customer to protect the producer's level of profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.739" offset="5862379">The Commission has authority to consider the reasonableness of any cost incurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.726" offset="5878262">But the kicker is under that ad hoc reasonableness standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.295" offset="5892577">The Commission would be required to find the cost to be reasonable in any case of a market value royalty that was held to apply to the intrastate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.307" offset="5932596">Shell and Pennzoil when they depart momentarily from their minimalist portrait of the decision below, admit as much, they argued that the Commission would be required to grant them relief for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.809" offset="5982647">That these leases were entered into before the Natural Gas Act or before Phillips that the royalty provisions were consistent with the industry standard at that time and that the price increase would generate no profits since it would simply be pass through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.328" offset="6052655">Well, that would be true generically, typically of market value leases in any state where such leases had been held or might be held to refer or the intrastate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.689" offset="6094137">Thus, if all the Commission could consider was whether a particular royalty had been entered into reasonably, it would have to find that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.330" offset="6128724">And that's what at stake here is not simply a procedural issue but whether the Commission must grant relief on a generic basis for such market value royalties and the Commission held consistently with Texaco that it may not do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1574.428" offset="6401128">The Act has considerable impact in many ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.779" offset="6414503">However, as we point out in the brief, the ceiling price for -- the ceiling price provided by the new Act for gas that was already dedicated to interstate commerce under the old Act would remain the ceiling price that had been set by the Commission as adjusted for inflation or that had been increased by the Commission under the just and reasonable rates of the new Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.542" offset="6505514">Thus, the prices applicable to this gas under the new Act are based on the prices applicable under the old act and that in very brief is why we think the issue is still alive and needs decision although admittedly in the future as the two markets converge the practical significance of the issue may be expected to decrease.</text>

            <text syncTime="1632.639" offset="6633932">I must say that I've been increasingly intrigued as this case has developed on its way from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, particularly in the position that the Commission's been taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.514" offset="6689416">I didn't prepare these remarks to begin this way but let me take a few minutes of my time and tell you why I'm so intrigued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.598" offset="6721808">That is the Commission in its opinion and the opinion on the case below said, “We cannot permit any incremental royalty costs resulting from this settlement or resulting from any judgment by state court regarding royalty payments to be based on -- to be passed on to the pipeline if these incremental royalty costs were based on any further factors than the regulated just and reasonable right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.930" offset="6839045">They did not say, we cannot permit any right based on intrastate rates to be passed on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.848" offset="6870810">They said any factor other than the just and reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.430" offset="6889096">And of course there are number of other factors that should be involved in any case like this and they're involved in the case below that we had witnesses valid and all that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.876" offset="6922846">The interesting thing about this is the Commission decided it had no authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.943" offset="6943117">This case was tried in the Fifth Circuit as a question of authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="1751.340" offset="7108733">The interesting thing about it though is, that as the record below shows the settlement in this case, it was a settlement of royalty litigation under market value lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.887" offset="7150947">The settlement had the royalty to either 78 cents or 150% of the national rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.259" offset="7176443">At the time the settlement was executed, the Commission had before it in the rulemaking proceeding, the proposal to permit small producers to collect 150% of the national right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.620" offset="7225866">This settlement was tied exactly to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.538" offset="7233494">At that time the national rate as reflected in the record below is 52 cents per Mcf and 78 cents is exactly 150% of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.223" offset="7272260">This settlement was tied directly to commission set rates and not to intrastate rates. Unfortunately, the only direct testimony in this point was produced by Pennzoil's witness Gray, which is found at page 36 of the transcript in this case which because why the case's brief in the Fifth Circuit is not in the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.196" offset="7368182">Of course it is viable to the ourt, if the court wish we would file that as a supplemental appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.923" offset="7395035">Those are the facts of how that case got to the Fifth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1930.854" offset="7826787">Well, Your Honor, I'm certainly aware that this Court has held that it would be improper to -- in the Burlington Trucking line -- Trucking case to affirm lower a Commission decision based on post talk rationalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.039" offset="7887496">And yes sir, I'm suggesting if that's the basis of the primary thrust of their argument at this point that the Court cannot and should not affirm it on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.121" offset="7923858">Now, if the Court wishes to affirm it on the question of authority, which is what we briefed in the Fifth Circuit argued there and I thought we were arguing here, then of course, the Court is free to do that because the Commission did address that issue also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.868" offset="7986866">And I will suggest that the basic reason that the Commission has reached the position that's it's in, in this case, is because it did read Texaco but it misread it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.627" offset="8029915">We read Texaco as being the case basically where the Commission was attempting to deregulate small producer rates by tying them directly and solely to intrastate process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.532" offset="8089475">We read Texaco as holding that the Commission cannot deregulate something over which it has the right jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.091" offset="8119777">But that if the Commission wishes to regulate indirectly, it must consider all factors and not solely intrastate price levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.842" offset="8158751">We're not asking permission in our case to deregulate anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.211" offset="8176201">As Mr. Barnett candidly admitted, Commission has no jurisdiction over royalty cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.629" offset="8201906">They do that jurisdiction over our entire right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.991" offset="8215385">Now, we brought forth a request for inquiries on that regulated right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.196" offset="8240149">And we ask them to consider all the relevant factors and there were several put out in the testimony and case below at the hearing before --</text>

            <text syncTime="2042.724" offset="8274317">The Commission itself found that the, I think that this is an accurate quote that the Commission found that the impetus of the settlement is the market value of the royalties and no consideration has been given to regulative rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.205" offset="8332204">So the Commission equated this request with an intrastate unregulated market request.</text>

            <text syncTime="2066.451" offset="8369194">Your Honor, certainly, we agree that the impetus of the litigation and the impetus of the settlement and the impetus of our application for relief was the litigation that was requesting market value be based on intrastate or other process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.543" offset="8429589">Simply because that is what that cause this whole thing to get going.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.027" offset="8447457">It doesn't mean that that's what the settlement was based on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.231" offset="8472325">We view their holding as set out on page 261 of the joint appendix and the second sentence, the one I quoted earlier as saying they have no authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.482" offset="8533347">And that certainly laid the Commission brief to the Fifth Circuit and that's the way we briefed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.127" offset="8563858">I would suggest that since we're not asking the Commission to based any component of our right on intrastate rights solely, even assuming that our process were based in part on intrastate rights, we can't see how as a matter of logic the answer of the question of whether the Commission has authority should be any different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.131" offset="8699904">Though we think what the Commission has done in this case is to do the same thing it did in Texaco and that is to focus solely on one comparison that is the comparison of the settlement right here with intrastate process and then to say, “We're sorry Pennzoil, we're sympathetic to your plot but Texaco tells us that we can't focus solely on this comparison and grant your rate increase.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.178" offset="8816097">Pennzoil believes that our argument is consistent, our reading of Texaco, pardon me, is consistent with the purposes of the Act and with this Court's previous decisions and with the Commission's previous representations to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.115" offset="8871790">And I'm talking specifically here about the Mobil case in review of the Southern Louisiana Area Rate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.050" offset="8903555">In the Commission's brief in that case, they specifically told the Court that the producers in a market value royalty bond could petition for individualize relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.548" offset="8957576">We believe that that was the basis upon which the Commission was affirmed in setting area rights on that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="2277.547" offset="9213576">Your Honor, our view, the Columbia case, the Texaco case, and Pennzoil's position on this case is being entirely consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.593" offset="9253700">And the Columbia case what the Commission did basically was to look at those costs that were being included those purchase costs that were being included in the Pipeline's flow through and their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.504" offset="9301347">And so we don't have jurisdiction over those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.658" offset="9310020">We can't automatically exclude them because solely because they're equal to or based upon or tied to or related to in some way market value cost though we do have the authority to review them on the merits and determine whether or not they make statutory section for just and unreasonable test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.340" offset="9388701">And that's what we're here claiming the Commission has authority to do in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.713" offset="9410226">I think this is also consistent with El Paso case which you asked about earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.569" offset="9429661">In the El Paso case, the Commission in fact granted the flow through and the jurisdictional right of a royalty component that's virtually identical to the one that Pennzoil is asking for the flow through, Your Honor, virtually identical to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.491" offset="9505311">Though, they tried to distinguish that in their brief and in this argument, on the basis that that's a pipeline and their cost of service is regulated individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.248" offset="9544391">The face of the order in that opinion at page 5 shows that they in fact had to waive the National Rate Regulations which were then applicable to El Paso's rights in order to grant them relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.642" offset="9589948">It also shows the 25% of El Paso's production would continue with price that the applicable national rate for producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.888" offset="9618892">But that's not really the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.310" offset="9624639">The point really is that Section 4, the Natural Gas Act, applies equally to producers on the pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.913" offset="9655045">And if they have the authority to do it for pipelines, they have the authority to do for producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.463" offset="9677197">Now, we're not here arguing and we didn't argue before the Fifth Circuit that the Commission is compelled to regulate producers the same way it regulates pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.699" offset="9718157">If it can find reasonable reasons for distinguishing, for putting one method of regulation for pipelines and one for producers, we have no quarrel with that assuming they can support that on some reasonable basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.529" offset="9769462">Our only point is that it's the same statute and the authority basically has to be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.589" offset="9793703">And I characterize the question of authority as more quite frankly than merely procedural.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.573" offset="9817631">I believe it is more than procedural.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.999" offset="9855352">The National -- the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, of course we have not filed a brief on that, I only have one brief comment on it, and that is that under Section 502 (c) of that statute, it appears to expressly grant the Commission, the authority to permit rate relief to any individual gas producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.942" offset="9959111">Notwithstanding that the end result of that rate would no longer be just and reasonable under the Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.123" offset="9999862">We are not arguing that as a basis for overturning the Commission's opinion because it is not in effect at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.473" offset="10029223">But I thought it would be pertinent to at least call it the Court's attention.</text>

            <text syncTime="2540.747" offset="10266311">If the Court will refer to page 27261 of the appendix, the Commission said at that point we cannot permit any incremental royalty cost resulting from this settlement or resulting from any judgment by state court regarding royalty payments to be passed on to the Pipeline if this incremental royalty costs are based on any other factors than the regulated just and reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.698" offset="10382190">I believe the Commission is saying and reading Texaco is that they do not have the authority to grant the relief requested by Shell and Pennzoil in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2599.438" offset="10501099">And that's the way the Commission reads Texaco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.605" offset="10517817">If confirmation is needed, I believe it appears in the Court of Appeals opinion at pages 6 (a) of the appendix to the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.492" offset="10553344">And the Court of Appeals said, the Commission concluded that it was not free to allow royalty costs which are based on market values to be passed on to the pipelines as just and reasonable rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="2643.423" offset="10677060">It is our position that it is the Administrative Law Judge disagreed with our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.778" offset="10702451">The Commission did not reach it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.361" offset="10712795">With reference to, another issue which the Commission did not decide because of its position is whether the increase royalty cost was prudently and reasonably incurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.029" offset="10759502">This was specifically reserved by the Court of Appeals to the Commission on remake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.064" offset="10783640">If this issues, if the Commission's position is affirmed here, the Commission will never reach these issues because it contends that it has no authority to decide them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.116" offset="10843826">I would now like to discuss the reference to Justice Blackmun's question about the Natural Gas Policy Act and whether Congress has undermined the import of Texaco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.862" offset="10902862">We believe that while the Natural Gas Policy Act fixes different categories, price categories for gas, it still makes a difference as to whether the gas was sold on the intra or interstate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.211" offset="10964198">That as far as the rational of Texaco is concerned it is no longer material because the ceiling prices set up prospectively in the Natural Gas Policy Act apply across the Board whether the sale is interstate or intrastate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.239" offset="11024280">In fact, as a portion of that Act, Section 105 the Congress specifically approved the intrastate contract prices for past periods as being the maximum lawful price permitted under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.210" offset="11080182">We therefore believe that the Commission in this Court's earlier concern about the unrated regulated market is no longer material under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.633" offset="11121873">As Mr. Stevens pointed out, this Commission has itself utilized the intrastate prices along with other factors in determining producer rates in past cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.802" offset="11166595">In the area rate proceedings, specifically the other southwest area rate case, the Commission did utilize intrastate prices in determining the producer rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.350" offset="11204733">This use was attacked on appeal on the Fifth Circuit and was specifically affirmed by the Fifth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2804.071" offset="11319672">Mr. Stevens has already referred to the Pipeline cases which we believe are squarely in point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.597" offset="11345795">The Commission also in dealing with the prices on emergency sales for natural gas, and limit the terms sales, by producers has reference to comparable prices in the intrastate market in determining whether these sales are reasonable or unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.194" offset="11408175">The Commission collects data on the intrastate market on Form 45 and quarterly publishes reports of that data which it utilizes in Producer rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.400" offset="11448926">We therefore do no believe the Commission Acts consistently when it says that it cannot look to intrastate prices for any purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.836" offset="11486751">We would also like to point out that we believe that this case is distinguishable from Texaco because the royalty provides only one of the cost components which the Commission looks to in determining producer rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.630" offset="11549863">The price of the other cost components, steel pipe, labor, federal income taxes is not subject to Commission regulation either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.939" offset="11583091">But as the Court of Appeals pointed out, these prices are used as determinates in the commission rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2997.851" offset="12094777">And thirdly, in the Mobil case, the Commission expressly was faced with the situation here and asked by the Producers in the Texas Gulf Coast area rate proceeding and the Southern Louisiana area rate proceeding which became the Mobil case in this Court to allow relief or this very problem, the market value roll the question on an area or national basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="3038.573" offset="12257677">The Fifth Circuit specifically affirmed the Commission on that basis and the Fifth Circuit's language if I could just quote it is this, “If a subsequent advanced developed the producers are put in a bind by their royalty obligations, they may certainly petition the FPC for individualize relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.102" offset="12335731">That language from the Fifth Circuit was quoted in this Court's opinion in Mobil with approval.</text>

            <text syncTime="3397.688" offset="13694098">Of course, this Court have and opinion holds that the lessor would be so required.</text>

            <text syncTime="3442.459" offset="13873194">Just a couple of brief points, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.683" offset="13886151">First of all with respect to the Mobil case which my brothers rely on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.175" offset="13908093">The Court said there that Mobil's argument is hypothetical at this stage and that in any event and effective producer is entitled to seek individualize relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.287" offset="13952502">The Court went on to quote the D.C. Circuit which said, if there are subsequent events developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.281" offset="13972459">The producers are put in a bind by their royalty obligations, they may certainly petition FPC for individualize relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.016" offset="14003388">Permian contemplated it and of this Court's quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.890" offset="14018957">Well, we would say first of all that producers here were entitled to seek individualize relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.502" offset="14041422">They did seek it and the Commission decided that it would be inconsistent with the Act to grant it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.729" offset="14062320">Further, we were denied that the producers here have been put in a bind in the terms of the Mobil decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.081" offset="14095653">The Court went on to say Permian contemplated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.161" offset="14107982">Well, what did Permian contemplate?</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.468" offset="14117282">If one looks at the relevant language in the Permian decision, 390 U.S. at 770, the court there said the Commission declared that our producer should be permitted appropriate relief if it establishes that it's out of pocket expenses in connection with the operation of a particular well exceed its revenue from the well under the applicable area price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.169" offset="14208084">The Commission acknowledged that there might be other circumstances in which relief would be given but decline to enumerate them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3531.153" offset="14227937">In your view, the language of Mobil, I think it was being in bind does not occur until the rates are confiscatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="3539.911" offset="14263045">Yes, we would interpret it that way and we would rely on the reference to Permian which did precisely interpret the relief provision that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.028" offset="14303483">To respond to the point about whether the Commission here did in fact rely on the fact that these proposed incremental royalties were based on the intrastate rate, we submit that that's clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.384" offset="14356877">At page 8261 of the appendix, the Commission said in the instant proceeding, the impetus of the settlement is the market value of the royalties and no consideration has been given to regulated rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.609" offset="14409853">On rehearing 8290, the Commission said, I'm sorry, 291 to 292, “It is plain that the royalty has to be based on 78 cents which is the settlement's reflection of market prices that are above the area ceiling prices.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.461" offset="14465233">The Court of Appeals petition appendix 3 (a) stated that in the Louisiana state court, a lessor asserted royalty claim based on intrastate prices for natural gas which greatly exceed the ceiling rates to establish by the FPC for interstate sales.</text>
