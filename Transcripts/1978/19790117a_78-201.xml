            <text syncTime="76.802" offset="410624">Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.120" offset="423894">This case involve the question of whether procedural due process applies in the granting a parole and if so the extent of the required procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.620" offset="497873">As this Court is aware the Circuits have been pretty evenly divided on this, some of them saying that no procedural due process applies at all and others saying that it applies to the extent that reasons must be given for the denial of parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.289" offset="588570">As a matter of fact the Fourth Circuit in Franklin versus Shield required more extensive procedures and the court sitting en banc it reversed the panel and said that the only procedures required was giving of the reasons for the denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.658" offset="678013">However, in this case the Court of Appeals mandated very extensive procedures of requiring that each inmate be given a formal hearing at the time that he first became eligible, that he be given notice of the factors that would be considered and so forth, I won’t list all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.721" offset="814268">The most important one, I think the one that we are most concerned with is the last, the Court of Appeals said that an inmate denied parole must be given a full and fair explanation in writing of the essential facts relied on and the reasons for denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.946" offset="911130">Now we have no objection to the giving out the reasons for denial, because under State Law he is now required to be given the reasons for denial, but when the Board is required to given him a full and fair explanation in writing of the essential facts relied upon, we think that they are changing the entire type of hearing and making it an evidentiary hearing and it would be very difficult for us to comply with that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ralph H. Gillan</label>
            <text syncTime="251.562" offset="1109661">Yeah, it’s very true Your Honor and I think that there, there may well be a strong inclination for various states to do that if some of these procedures are recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.585" offset="1173713">Now so our question here is whether it applies at all and whether Nebraska has complied with any procedures which are required by the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.765" offset="1234422">We believe that there are two basic reasons why procedural due process should not apply to the granting parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.529" offset="1273501">I will discuss the weaker of those two arguments first.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.699" offset="1298160">First we believe that there is a difference between the deprivation of a right which has already been granted, a freedom which has been granted and the refusal to grant that freedom in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.896" offset="1370990">Now the Fifth Circuit has relied pretty exclusively on that distinction in Scarpa versus U.S. Parole Board and in Morrissey versus Brewer, this Court quoted with approval the language in Bay versus The Board of Parole drawing that distinction, holding that there is a difference between refusing to give some one a benefit and taking away a benefit which are already been given.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.868" offset="1562833">I am not contending that that distinction should be decisive in this case because I can visualize a situation in which a state statute provided that upon proof of a certain set of facts that a person should be entitled to a certain benefit or conversely that he should be entitled to a certain benefit in the absence of proof of facts or certain facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.983" offset="1719254">I do think however that the cases indicate that the showing should be much clearer and the case of the granting of a benefit and that the procedures that would be required would probably be less in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.500" offset="1813400">The primary reason that I believe the -- that procedural due process should not apply in this case, if that under State law there are no provable facts, which require the granting of parole and there are no facts which must be proved to denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.883" offset="1926875">The Statute that Nebraska operates under is cited in our brief and first of all it makes denial of parole dependent upon the Parole Boards having an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.712" offset="2022170">It’s not – there is nothing in here that says that if the -- if it should be found that certain facts are true that he shall be granted parole that or that he may be denied a parole in the event certain facts are established.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.258" offset="2104404">It provides whenever the Board of Parole considers release of a committed defender, it shall order his release unless it is of the opinion that his release should be deferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.830" offset="2158738">And then look at the factors that are the conditions under which they can deny it.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.176" offset="2204087">There is a substantial risk that he will not confirm to the conditions of parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.541" offset="2229582">What facts would one prove that would show that there is a substantial risk that he will not confirm to the conditions of his parole.</text>

            <text syncTime="2454.087" offset="9919718">Under those circumstances under a statute or in regulation which conferred no entitlement to work release or furlough, we would say there will be no right to a due process hearing at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2492.911" offset="10074990">Unlike the Nebraska Statute which creates a presumption that the prisoner will be released at the first moment of eligibility or shortly thereafter, the United States Parole Commission Statute establishes utmost a presumption that the prisoner will be released at sometime during the guidelines established by the United States Parole Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.876" offset="10178853">The Commission is absolutely free in its discretion to select a date within that guideline range, although if the commission selects a date outside the guideline range, the commission must have good cause to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.339" offset="10236740">Because the commission has absolute discretion to select a date within the guideline range under the position that we have taken no due process hearing and all would be required so long as the release date is selected does fall within that guideline period.</text>

            <text syncTime="2552.825" offset="10314689">I should hasten to say as a second distinguishing feature that by regulation, the United States Parole Commission has adopted a procedure of setting a presumptive release date which, very soon after the prisoner arrives at the Federal Institution which tells the prisoner that on, for example, March 3rd 1981, the prisoner will be released so long as a, there’s good behavior be a satisfactory release plan has established and finally there’s no subsequent new information that comes to light which shows that the original plan was a mistake in the first place or the original date was a mistake.</text>

            <text syncTime="2615.145" offset="10564002">The significance of that is that under the position of the United States, once a presumptive release date is set subject to those conditions it cannot be changed or altered without some sort of the due process hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.531" offset="10629517">With respect to the merits, it is our position that denial of parole requires a due process hearing only where the statute or regulations or some mutual expectation as the Court said in the Leis versus Flynt case last Monday, exist to create an entitlement to release.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.297" offset="10724603">We think this follows from two propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.555" offset="10737560">First, the denial of parole itself does not result in a deprivation of liberty, the deprivation of liberty occurs upon conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.612" offset="10777788">The denial of parole continues the incarceration under that lawfully imposed sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.680" offset="10806105">Now, if the Court accepts that argument then the remainder of the argument seems to be dictated by this Court’s decisions since Roth in which the question has been very clearly posed in terms of whether or not to State or Federal Statute or some custom has created an entitlement under given circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.583" offset="10901713">Here the Nebraska Statute does create an entitlement to release so as the Court of Appeals found upon subject to defeasance upon any of four conditions and we believe that does fall within this Court’s definition of what an entitlement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2793.514" offset="11277458">It looks more like liberty than property but because it an entitlement and because both liberty and property are used together in the Due Process Clause, we would think that the analysis which respect to each would be the same whether or not there is some entitlement either to liberty or to property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.495" offset="11369305">With respect to what processes do there is normally the due process cases in this Court have address the full panoply of rights or components on the hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2833.268" offset="11436492">One of those issues was when should the hearing be held not about the components should be and other issue is whether or not a summary of the evidence of fact should be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.032" offset="11475466">In my remaining time I would like to address briefly just the first of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.832" offset="11506709">It is a very important question that differentiates parole releases from parole revocation and at one with the question of when the hearing itself should be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.264" offset="11556446">Unlike the case in Morrissey where the revocation hearing had to come in the wake of the alleged violation, here we have a sensitive process of monitoring the progress of an inmate and the very question itself was determining when is most propitious movement to hold the hearing is itself a delicate question subject to the expertise in the Parole Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.175" offset="11660100">And for that reason we would suggest that perhaps the Court of Appeals was an error in mandating that that hearing be held at the first movement of eligibility rather than perhaps at a movement when the hearing might really do the inmate or good.</text>

            <text syncTime="3166.324" offset="12768632">That interest is routinely deprived by the practices employed by the Nebraska Parole Board, but it’s not yet been pointed out to the Court with any specificity if the stage at which the parole release decision is made in the State of Nebraska and the lack of procedural protections which are there afforded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.950" offset="12843133">In fact the parole release decision is seldom made at the final parole hearing rather it is made in the State of Nebraska at a case in record review, a proceeding at which few of any procedural safeguards are employed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3937.655" offset="15854007">And under those circumstances there is a statutory entitlement to a fair consideration of parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3944.699" offset="15882219">In discussing that very statute the National Advisory Commission on the Criminal Justice Standards and Goals stated that the model penal code represents a turnaround in the traditional assumption that the burden of proof however evaluated rests on the inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.118" offset="15939793">It proposes that an inmate is to be released on parole when he is first eligible unless one of the four conditions exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3966.470" offset="15969259">I suggest to the Court that the statute therefore creates a presumption in favor of release defeasible only if one of the limited number of grounds for denial is found to be present.</text>

            <text syncTime="4077.844" offset="16414699">But in many cases I think it will be very useful both to the inmate and the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4082.175" offset="16432044">And if the Court can instruct us on how to draw a line between what will be useful and what won’t in that standpoint, I think you know it would be very helpful to our concern, but absent that kind of a line I think that all of those hearings are going to have to be conducted for the benefit of the many over those -- over the extreme examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="4102.767" offset="16514487">The Board has argued here in some of the questions of concern this objective of discretionary nature of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4109.218" offset="16540296">I think it’s important to note that this Court’s cases have required a consideration of the interest at stake, not the nature of the board’s proceedings in determining whether due process applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.086" offset="16587734">Release proceedings in my mind are two step process, the first is a fact gathering process, through the file, through the social history of the inmate, through the correctional department talking to the employee, the people he may be employed by, it gathers many objective facts that the Parole Board will consider in the exercise of its discretion; that discretion being the second step in the parole process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4145.429" offset="16685119">But it’s significant and important to the inmate and so they have the ability to ensure that the facts upon which that predictive expertise of the Parole Board is exercised are accurate and correct in order to prevent the occurrence of inaccurate decisions based upon inaccurate facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.709" offset="16770173">Briefly I’d like to call the Court’s attention as well the notice provisions undertaken by the State of Nebraska as to parole proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4176.663" offset="16809984">In the State of Nebraska at a parole release review hearing or at a final hearing if the inmate is either deferred or denied parole, he is informed of the month during which he will next appear before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4188.788" offset="16858572">He is not advised however as to the day or the hour at which that hearing will occur, that information is supplied to the inmate only on the day of the actual hearing through the posting of a list at the penal complex of the inmates who will be heard on that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="4205.886" offset="16926908">In notifying the inmates of the reasons for denial particularly following a review hearing the notice takes on the effect of being almost meaningless to the inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4218.026" offset="16975496">The Board uses a pre-printed form called a PB-1 an example of which is located at page 35 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="4226.247" offset="17008410">While the Board continues a statuary ground or the form contains statuary grounds for denial of parole, the Board simply checks it off without explanation of what the specific facts upon which it is relying are.</text>
            <text syncTime="4239.081" offset="17059715">In 80% of the cases it checks item A which reads, your continued correctional treatment, vocational, educational or job assignment in the facility will substantially enhance your capacity to lead a law abiding life when you are released at a later date.</text>
            <text syncTime="4254.650" offset="17121991">No explanation is ever given on this form to the inmate as to which of the alternatives listed in that item apply to him, and no response is made to an inmate if he requests the Board specifically to tell him whether it is correctional treatment, vocational treatment, educational treatment or job assignment that they are concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="4274.394" offset="17200985">The second part of the form is entitled correctional deficiencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4278.949" offset="17219166">It’s commendable that the Board would want to tell the inmates how to correct their deficiencies, but six listed deficiencies are stated on that form, and in 379 I think the figure is, out of 385 cases covered in the survey in the back of the appendix, the inmates had all six items checked, items such as joining self improvement clubs regardless of the fact that the inmate was a member of every self improvement club at the penitentiary.</text>
