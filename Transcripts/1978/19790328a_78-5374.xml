            <text syncTime="578.767" offset="2418395">We compare it to the situation of a housekeeper coming into a hotel room.</text>

            <text syncTime="591.826" offset="2470640">On the other hand, if she is contacted by the police department and said “why don't you go into that room for us and see what is there because we suspect something maybe going on,” then she is operating as the agent of the police department and is not properly on the premises at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="672.055" offset="2791633">So, that one who is dialing a local call assumes that there is a pen register device working.</text>

            <text syncTime="697.296" offset="2892570">These are-- there is a substantial difference between that local calla and that long distance call.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.994" offset="2923395">When one then dials the 1 or the area code, he is then voluntarily turning over the information similar to the deposit or to the mailing of an envelope or mailing of a letter or where a person is in the room and he is talking supposedly confidentially to a third person.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.736" offset="3018271">But, before he activates that type of device, he is not voluntarily turning over information.</text>

            <text syncTime="743.753" offset="3078353">If the person were to call the operator for assistance in making that call, then he is obviously voluntarily turning over that information to the operator and takes the chance, as been expressed, that that information may later be conveyed to someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.648" offset="3141987">But, until he does that, it cannot be said in a realistic way that he has voluntarily turned over that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.520" offset="3181484">Thus, it might be foreseeable that in the situation with a mail cover or a deposit that the information could be revealed to law enforcement officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1581.137" offset="6427878">I'd like to begin, if I may, by indicating to the Court what the pen register is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.128" offset="6455881">I think, Mr. Justice Marshall, we know something about that from this Court's definition in Giordano and New York Telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.585" offset="6489736">We know something about it from the Court's fairly Dote discussion in the Ninth Circuit in the Hodge case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.267" offset="6508440">We know about it from a various lower view articles that have appeared in the-- cited in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.629" offset="6533935">We know even on this sparse record, that the telephone company representative who testified at the-- at a hearing in these proceedings referred to the pen register as a normal and-- normal telephone equipment is what he called it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.950" offset="6595166">But, the point I'd like to make, Your Honors, is that it hears no sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.533" offset="6609481">It captures no words uttered into the mouth piece, as this Court phrased it in Katz.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.823" offset="6630693">It captures no content.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.793" offset="6638529">It achieves no communication, other than the limited communication between the user and the phone company itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.341" offset="6664756">It has been defined by Congress, indeed, by its exclusion from the requirements of Title 3 as not to be a communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.053" offset="6695581">It doesn't disclose if the call is completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.580" offset="6705716">It doesn't reveal who the caller is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.870" offset="6714807">It doesn't say if the number was busy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.818" offset="6722644">It doesn't say who the parties are and it doesn't tell the duration of the call.</text>

            <text syncTime="1689.076" offset="6859630">The user of a telephone knows to go back to the days, however long ago they may be, to go back to the days when this was not done mechanically but done by human communication.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen H. Sachs</label>
            <text syncTime="1780.391" offset="7224926">My point, sir, is that the user of a telephone has no reasonable expectation that the information he imparts to the company as to the number he wishes to achieve will not be imparted to other persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.035" offset="7271528">He knows that every month he gets the long distance calls he dials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.002" offset="7287411">He knows that, in many parts of the country, telephones are subject to separate racially structures so that, for billing purposes, the phone company needs to know how many calls on a certain-- for certain purposes are used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.006" offset="7347388">He knows that the telephone companies in the business of protecting its own tariffs and its own customers by investigating complaints of annoying and obscene telephone calls.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.571" offset="7381661">He knows all those things. He has code in his phonebook, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.145" offset="7399946">In every phonebook in this nation, he knows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.878" offset="7410918">And, I have-- I don't think I stray very far from the record in this case in reading to you what the phonebook says and what it says, at least in Washington, D.C., is that we have employees who are trained to assist and advice you and who can frequently help in identifying to the authorities the origin of unwelcomed and troublesome calls.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.574" offset="7485628">So, for all those reasons, we suggest to the Court that the average telephone user probably ought not have a subjective expectation of privacy as to the number called but, in any case, it's not an expectation that will be recognized for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2090.295" offset="8464593">It's a kind of a backwater factually and legally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.960" offset="8479222">If I may echo what Mr. Justice Rehnquist said a few moments ago, it is really ironic that what we're testing here is a-- is something as to which, over the years, there has been increased factual privacy because the average phone user probably does have in fact more privacy than he or she did 50 years ago when the phone was first used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.739" offset="8570337">And, the specter of electronic surveillance that is injected into the case by the petitioner, seems to me, is misplaced because what we have here is really a phone company mechanism that is very much a part of their normal and routine operations which people understand and know are likely to be at any given moment, for lots of different reasons, breached by the phone company or the phone company which may then go to lawful authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.881" offset="8682872">It's the state's position, Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, that the communication made here to the phone company of the numbers dialed is a business communication to a company which has every reason in the world to record and, on occasion, reveal that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.918" offset="8759045">And, it is no kind of communication nor the circumstances-- the kind of circumstances, that this Court in any of its prior rulings has said it has faced against.</text>

            <text syncTime="2209.125" offset="8939917">It is very different, we suggest, than the communication out from that hotel room or from one's home on leased lines of a company which is not your own, on equipment which is not your own, of a communication much like calling the plumber and saying “I have water in my cellar, please come.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.031" offset="9023509">That plumber can, if he wishes, tell the police “Sachs has water in his cellar.” The call out from your hotel room to the butcher that says “I want three pork chops” could be revealed to the police, “Sachs want three pork chops.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2320.459" offset="9385253">It has the general aspects of a generalized search of everything in that room and I think, as we know from Rakas and as we know from other recent cases of this Court, we have not abandoned property concepts altogether when we analyze the Katz expectation test.</text>
