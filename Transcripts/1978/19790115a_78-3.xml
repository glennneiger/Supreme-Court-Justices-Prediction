            <text syncTime="66.241" offset="368306">The question before the Court in this case is whether Georgia may consistent with the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the United States Constitution allow the mother of an illegitimate child to recover for the wrongful death of that child and deny that right to the father of the child despite the fact that the mother is deceased and despite the fact that the father maintained a meaningful relationship with that child.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.953" offset="459212">And it presents to relate a question of whether the present classification constitutes impermissible gender-based discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.745" offset="490350">The Georgia Supreme Court in this opinion makes the point over and over again that the legitimate state interest to be promoted by the present classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.202" offset="520129">There's a discouragement of an illegal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.108" offset="531832">The illegal act that classifications is purported to discourage is the creation in the birth of children out of wedlock.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.629" offset="561925">That illegal act has two participants, each of an equal degree of participation and each of an equal degree of complicity.</text>

            <text syncTime="139.466" offset="661191">And yet despite the fact that these parties have an equal degree of participation in the act that the state seeks to discourage, one of those parties has accorded all the rights of a natural parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.649" offset="697971">She has accorded all the rights of a natural parent without regard to what her actual relationship with the child was and she has re -- she has accorded those rights without the necessity of being affirmative action on her part.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.504" offset="741439">By contrast, the state has singled out the other participant in the illegal act as the member who will serve as the state's means of discouraging that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.594" offset="777697">He has accorded none of the rights, accorded a natural parent unless he takes affirmative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.700" offset="806222">Appellant submits that in cases like the present one that the classification before the Court constitutes impermissible gender-based discrimination and is otherwise in violation of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="220.431" offset="985109">I think it could have a carefully tuned statute like it -- like several other states have.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.198" offset="1004126">For example, Washington State has a statute which establishes a preferential scheme of recovery that allows the father of an illegitimate child to participate in that recovery if he had done one of two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.135" offset="1051878">No, if he done both two things, if he could prove his paternity and if he had regularly contributed for the support of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.971" offset="1079254">Maryland has a similar statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.407" offset="1085001">Maryland allows him to participate in the recovery if he can prove that he either had his paternity judicially established, that he acknowledge his paternity in writing or that he had openly and notoriously acknowledged the child as his own during the child's life.</text>

            <text syncTime="1122.188" offset="4592097">The first is that the classification must support a valid governmental objective.</text>

            <text syncTime="1152.495" offset="4713305">As this Court stated in Weber versus Aetna Casualty, it is illogical to assume that people would shun illicit relationships for fear that their children may not one day be able to reap the benefits of a workman's compensation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.981" offset="4759280">And as Justice Hill in his dissenting opinion and the Georgia Supreme Court stated, the sanction employed by the state in this case comes too late to have possibly promote the legitimate state interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1749.648" offset="7101942">This is perhaps one of those unusual cases when insofar as the appellee is concerned, the defendant in the lower court, it really makes no difference to him whether he wins or loses before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.576" offset="7153664">The facts I think in order to clarify the reason for a lack of evidence in this case is that the defendant was sued by both the father of the illegitimate child and by the grandmother as administrarix of the estate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1985.054" offset="8043604">I don't see how you could ever get around that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.557" offset="8053635">And I think it makes a difference whether the child is seven or 21 or whether the mother and child had a meaningful relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.075" offset="8083623">Or any other number of things which would throw some light on the valuable person's life.</text>

            <text syncTime="2016.286" offset="8168469">Again I think that the Court should understand the posture in which the case got here and that is that the defendant file a motion for summary judgment in the pending action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.340" offset="8220714">And that motion for summary judgment by the defendant was opposed by an affidavit of the father of the illegitimate child and those are all of the facts that happened to be before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.978" offset="8267316">So there may be some facts that the Court has inquired about that no one knows because the Superior Court of Richmond County here that the affidavit of the father has two of these facts were taken as true and therefore rendered its decision based upon that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2058.831" offset="8338683">Mr. Miller, I take it under Georgia law, the father is not an heir of the deceased child.</text>

            <text syncTime="2065.188" offset="8364074">Mr. Justice Blackmun, I think that that is a correct statement and I think that it is also correct that the mother of an illegitimate child does not inherit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.157" offset="8396048">And I think that is the better question which should be brought to this Court for the decision and that is who the heirs at law of a person who is illegitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.134" offset="8447875">And I think that that would eliminate an awful lot of problems that would be brought forth in the event that this Court would hold the Georgia statute unconstitutional because eventually you will find that if this statute is unconstitutional, then of course the right of action in the mother is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.226" offset="8516315">Perhaps the right of action vested in the mother of a legitimate child to the exclusion of the father is unconstitutional and then we don't have any rights of action for wrongful death in the State of Georgia because they're all based thereon.</text>

            <text syncTime="2128.706" offset="8618193">They're only in session for 40 days when they had begun, they'll finish in January, the first part of their work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.916" offset="8647032">I think that in this case, that we should think for a minute about not only the problems that might be caused but by the manner in which the State of Georgia has treated illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.435" offset="8697083">Georgia by statute has allowed a father to file a petition to legitimate the child and it's a very simple matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.002" offset="8735431">It's simply a petition brought in the county where the trial resides, stating that he is a father and he can have the child assume his name if he so decides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.477" offset="8777331">It's not a very difficult thing and I think to decide a case based upon the level of awareness, it might exist through the citizens to the state for a law that has been on the books now for 92 years and has never been challenged by anyone, father, mother or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.988" offset="8843368">So it must be a very unique situation in one which I would submit to the Court would allow the state to proceed as it did and to hold that this particular statute is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.395" offset="8900942">It was passed in 1887 and amended one time in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.970" offset="8927274">Prior to that time, of course there was no cause of action for wrongful death by common law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2245.073" offset="9083695">We also in the codification of the laws have stated on numerous occasions in the statutes that there can be no discrimination on account of a person being illegitimate that there can be no defense of a child being illegitimate in action brought by the mother whether in her own right or in a representative capacity or as the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.134" offset="9171884">And that a mother can proceed to file an action and collect the proceeds arising out of the death of her child, natural child whether it be legitimate or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.693" offset="9234160">I can find no reason to vary from the most recent decision of Lalli v. Lalli or the Quilloin decision in arriving at the constitutionality of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.763" offset="9298422">In the Quilloin v. Walcott, the options that are available and were available to this father, here the father are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.772" offset="9338441">And Mr. Justice Marshall writing on a unanimous opinion of the Court stated that necessarily it existed that the father could have brought a petition to legitimate the child and therefore obtain a veto right over the adoption of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.650" offset="9401971">And I would think that it must be that the interest of a father in being able to veto the adoption of a child would far outweigh the right of a father to bring an action for damages for the death of a seven-year old child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.496" offset="9457351">It is incomprehensible to me that that would not be true and this Court held that since that was some middle ground that the father could take that is between exclusion in a case-by-case method or in the Trimble case having to marry the mother that he could in this instance bring a very informal petition and legitimate the child and thereby could have obtained the veto rights to their adoption.</text>

            <text syncTime="2746.399" offset="11088959">They leave that either to the child or to the mother to bring that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.205" offset="11104214">It is a criminal statute but -- also but I never heard of that being applied by the state unless it was to recoup some benefits that have been paid or an action was requested by the child or by the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.768" offset="11174431">And lastly I think that I wanted to point -- I wanted to cover is that I know of no way really that a mother can legitimate a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.759" offset="11218422">I do believe that if that were true, there'd be very few cases in which a child would remain illegitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.114" offset="11247783">I think on some occasions certainly a mother would not want to legitimate a child but if it didn't require her to marry the father but simply legitimate the child, I'm sure that there would be no illegitimate children and therefore no problems that we have today in this particular action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.452" offset="11329181">I submit to the Court that there is a rational and reasonable state interest to be protected and I submit that the vague generalities of equal protection and due process do not require that each case be decided on its merits which would be certainly not required and that they can do as they did in enacting the statute provide that the father could recover for the death of the child if he married the mother or filed a petition to legitimate the child.</text>

            <text syncTime="2851.934" offset="11511097">Counsel for appellee makes the point that these facts may be subject to speculation with regards with relationship between the father and child because they were only documented in affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.828" offset="11546728">What counsel for appellee does not point out is that it is a matter of record in this Court now that that affidavit and every other pleading and every brief that's been filed in this case was served on the maternal grandmother through her attorney for the expressed reasoning of giving them an opportunity to contest those facts if there were any -- if they existed to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.288" offset="11620498">There's been no effort to intervene in these proceedings, although under Georgia law, they are fully entitled to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.665" offset="11642023">There's been no response in the affidavit, no response in the brief from the Georgia Supreme Court and no response to the brief in this Court and they were served with all those documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.152" offset="11675982">Appellee asked the Court to affirm the decision of the Georgia Supreme Court relying on Quilloin versus Walcott.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.997" offset="11703359">I think that that case is distinguishable in several regards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.387" offset="11716942">I think the relationship between the father and the child there was sporadic, number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.544" offset="11733556">Number two, the father there was at least according to the hearing, the state properly applied the best interest of the child test and the father lost in that hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2932.621" offset="11833866">Well I think, the whole point I hate to be redundant is that I think the failing of -- the failure of the State of Georgia is the failure to recognize a middle ground between what Your Honor talks about and total exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.436" offset="11885066">I think -- a total exclusion by absolute right to recovery, I think that's the failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.234" offset="11900322">I think the Court in Quilloin was distinguishing between the rights of the father of an illegitimate child and of the -- of a divorced father.</text>

            <text syncTime="2962.152" offset="11951940">But here the present classification distinguishes between two participants in an illegitimate act purportedly to discourage that illegitimate act and I fail to say I could ever, ever promote that state interest to this service.</text>
