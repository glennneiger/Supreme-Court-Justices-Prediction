            <text syncTime="260.375" offset="1144874">The business reason in this particular instance was that the insured and the beneficiaries insisted upon that type of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.530" offset="1177475">The insureds under the policy that we are or under the forerunners of our policy where the domestic automobile manufacturers during a rather prolong strike in 1967 one of the major issues between the unions and the manufacturers was additional fringe benefits specifically health insurance benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.555" offset="1273605">Out of that collective bargaining agreement between the unions and the domestic automobile manufacturers arose in agreement that the domestic automobile manufacturers would in fact provide health insurance benefits in the form of full coverage service benefit provider agreements.</text>

            <text syncTime="2119.187" offset="8580159">We do not here have the policy of insurance which in any way mentions the price fixing aspects about which we complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.449" offset="8621119">All the policy provides with respect to who is a participating pharmacist is that he is someone who has agreed to furnish covered drugs to Blue Shield's insured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.078" offset="8675662">There is nothing said about the agreement with the pharmacy beyond that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.473" offset="8701262">And this is the policy that was exempted and this is the policy that was subsequently approved at nowhere in the process however was the pharmacy agreement considered or approved or anything done to it rather than the fact then it was mailed to Austin, to the State Board of Insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.216" offset="8776286">They took it and they didn't send it back.</text>

            <text syncTime="2175.090" offset="8803767">When we took their positions of the people at the State Board, I asked them specifically, “Do you claim any jurisdiction over pharmacists?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.833" offset="8838666">Their answer was, “No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.378" offset="8844936">I said, “Do you regulate this pharmacy agreement in any manner and they said, “No.”</text>
