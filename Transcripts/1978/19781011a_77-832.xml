            <text syncTime="68.931" offset="379068">This case is here on the Federal Reserve Board's petition for certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.413" offset="409057">The Seventh Circuit set aside an order of the Board which it denied respondent permission to become a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.153" offset="452002">This case presents the question whether the Board may deny a bank holding company application where the proposed bank subsidiary is undercapitalized and where the proposed holding company would be so encumbered by debt that the bank would remain undercapitalized for a period of at least 12 years.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="132.283" offset="632456">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.301" offset="636531">In respondent's brief, the point is made that the capital ratios were low that is recognized in Seventh Circuit opinion and indeed it's recognized in all of the other submissions from the Comptroller and from the Federal Reserve Bank and from the Board's staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.980" offset="703300">Respondent is an Illinois corporation which plan to acquire 80% of the voting stock, the First National Bank of Lincolnwood.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.862" offset="734856">It stated in its application that it would assume not only the stock but also a debt in the sum of $3.7 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.341" offset="768711">Respondent also planned to cause the bank to issue an additional million dollars in debt securities after formation of the holding company and an additional million dollars in equity after the holding company was formed.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.326" offset="820642">The application was initially reviewed by the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.966" offset="839241">The Reserve Bank recommended approval of the application despite its recognition that the capital level in the bank was below the Board's current guidelines and would remain below those guidelines during the 12-year period needed to retire the debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.122" offset="899845">The Reserve Bank believed however that the competence of management and possible improved earnings were positive factors which outweigh the low capitalization factor and in the brief letter, the Comptroller of the currency joined in that affirmative recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.258" offset="960449">When the application was received by the Board in Washington, it was reviewed initially by the Board's Division of Research and Statistics and then again by its Division of Banking Regulation and Supervision, both of which recommended denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.788" offset="1014575">They pointed out again that the bank was seriously undercapitalized at present.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.998" offset="1031398">The ratio of capital to assets was 5% when it should have been at least 8%.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.244" offset="1056371">That meant that the bank needed an additional $2.5 million in equity capital to meet the Board's minimum standards.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="245.614" offset="1085837">But denying the application wasn't going to give it that additional capital though, was it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="250.113" offset="1103809">That's quite correct but the insistence in this category of cases, the capital be replenished as a prerequisite to getting the desired change and status is the motivation that makes applicants come up with the additional equity capital.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="264.121" offset="1159816">In other words, the Board kind of has the red light and says, “Unless you meet -- unless the bank meets particular qualifications which we would not independently enforce if you're holding company application, we will deny leave for formation of the holding company.”</text>

            <text syncTime="277.421" offset="1213106">The light is red until the Board examines the financial resources of the parent and the subsidiary and has to find that each is adequate under the Board's current standards and in this case, it found a serious deficiency in the bank and it found that the holding company by extracting dividends from the bank would keep the bank would keep the bank in that undercapitalized state for a period of at least 12 years.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="309.134" offset="1339956">By insisting on replenishing of capital in this kind of case where there's a serious deficiency, the Board has obtained an injection of badly needed capital in some 400 separate cases and an injection of some $2 billion in badly needed equity in the banking system.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.770" offset="1406412">That's the good that's done and that's what at stake with this application approval power.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.128" offset="1427832">The power has been used effectively and successfully to augment the capital base in the nation's banks.</text>

            <text syncTime="361.270" offset="1548413">That's precisely the point and this procedure is identical to the procedure under the Federal Reserve Act which Congress stated was the model to be applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.549" offset="1589582">When an applicant seeks membership in the Federal Reserve System, it doesn't matter whether the change in status would cause a worsening of its condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.263" offset="1620407">It hardly ever will.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.381" offset="1624900">It's inconceivable that it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.018" offset="1631483">The question though in this context is whether minimal standards are met and if they're not met, the applicant is told to go back, improve the situation and come back at a later date for a Board approval and that's the approach that's been applied consistently under the holding company.</text>

            <text syncTime="1657.769" offset="6734451">May it please your -- may it please the Chief Judge in this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.652" offset="6750020">The transaction here involved does not change anything except for the better.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.704" offset="6782203">The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago wrote an analysis of this transaction which was quite full and which pointed out that the -- I think their exact language was that the bank would be severely prejudice or severely hindered if the transaction were not allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.850" offset="6854823">The reason for that is that by this transaction, by the formation of this holding company, the bank will or the entity consisting of the bank and its owners will benefit by $130,000.00 per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.540" offset="6913546">Right now, the amount would be a $160,000.00 a year because it's based upon the current average interest rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.908" offset="6943013">Now, if the Court please that is a large benefit and that is why the bank sought holding company status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.427" offset="6969031">In Illinois, having a bank holding company, a one bank holding company is of no particular great benefit from a business point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.668" offset="7002049">You can't open branch banks with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.151" offset="7011976">You can't have multiple holding company banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.410" offset="7029008">You can't do anything with it except really do what the voting trust does now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.848" offset="7046771">Now, the bank has a voting trust right now where the four men who were involved belong to this voting trust and that voting trust does exactly what the holding company will do which is sit there and vote every year at the time of election of directors and receive a dividend and use the dividend to pay interest on the loan which exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.702" offset="7134229">Now, in this transaction, there is absolutely nothing new created by the transaction, there is only a reshaping in form from a voting trust to a holding company which will perform precisely the same function as the voting trust.</text>

            <text syncTime="2008.757" offset="8138376">Now, as Congress wrote and as it would appear to me to have been intended to be written and as Chairman Burns said when it was -- when the 1971 Bank Holding Company Act was passed, the Federal Reserve Board does not pretend to want to regulate what goes on inside a bank and Mr. Burns said that -- Governor Burns said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.818" offset="8234611">He said, “We don't want to regulate banks, that's up to the Comptroller.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.127" offset="8251852">Now, the Comptroller has plenary powers over banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.551" offset="8265540">They have vast and enormous powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.206" offset="8272227">It's not some involved court thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.649" offset="8281945">One of the cases cited in the Government's reply brief here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.391" offset="8296887">The Malone case I believe gives an example of the breadth of that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.141" offset="8315904">They can go on a bank and say you're closed and you are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.884" offset="8326875">It's really very little you can do about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.389" offset="8332936">You go to a hearing later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.024" offset="8339519">So the Comptroller has very full powers to do as he wishes with the bank and he has the primary responsibility and in this instance, the Comptroller exercise a very basic primary responsibility and said, after there was a change, go ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.038" offset="8395525">The ironic thing is that the change the Comptroller proposed, the Federal Reserve Board didn't like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.027" offset="8419453">They said, one of the items in the record here says that the Federal Reserve Board regards it as less -- less favorable that the changes that the Comptroller required is making the proposition less favorable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3005.515" offset="12125393">In the legislative history argument, they go back to statutes -- to a statute passed in 1933 which would appear to require the holder of bank stock if a corporation to have certain financial standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.497" offset="12173354">Well, if Your Honors please, that was because in the 1930's, there was a law that said that bank stockholders were personally liable on their bank stock to the extent to the par value of that stock in case the bank fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.785" offset="12222464">Now, there was such a law once upon a time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.699" offset="12230196">It was -- its Section 64 of the National Banking Act and in 64 (a) repeals that as to bank stock acquired after some day back in the 1940's and it is no longer the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.635" offset="12269902">Now, there was once a very real and precise reasoning -- reason for requiring the owner of bank stock to have a certain financial status.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.037" offset="12303548">Now, the Board here tries to make that old law back into the law by saying that the owner of bank stock if it's a corporation should have a lot of money so that if there is trouble at the bank they can come up with the money and that's what they say in the opinion in this case, that they want the applicant, the holding company to have money to come up with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.411" offset="12389021">If the -- if that isn't the law anymore, the owner of bank stock can own nothing except that bank stock if he's an individual, he can be as poor as can be and its not against the law to own bank stock no matter how poor you are in other matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.389" offset="12444923">You can only own that stock and you can owe on it to a 100% of its worth and you can still lawfully own it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.503" offset="12473344">I think that the legislative history that counsel cites is undercut by the fact that in the initial writing of the laws on this subject, there was then existent, this law requiring that you make up any loss in a bank if you're a stock holder to the extent of the par value of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.630" offset="12549935">If the Court please, we contend that the Seventh Circuit was right that if it doesn't make any difference, it shouldn't make any difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="3134.624" offset="12641886">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.937" offset="12651081">I would differ with Mr. Collins with great deference on the question of monetary policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.257" offset="12672397">This case has nothing to do with monetary policy in simple terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.107" offset="12687757">Monetary policy is concerned with the level of money in the general economy and it's regulated through open market transactions, reserve requirements and through the interest rate of the discount window of the --</text>

            <text syncTime="3157.136" offset="12731956">How would you say -- how would you say that relates it all to the desirability or undesirability of speculation and bank stocks at any particular period?</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="3171.352" offset="12788799">I believe that that's a separate question, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.905" offset="12799039">The point I'd like to make if I may is that this case is dealing not with money supply with the safety of banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.399" offset="12832998">It's not concerned with aggregate demand of the economy but with the cushion of equity in the banking system and Mr. Collins referred to Mrs. Heller's treaties, I think if the Court reviews that, it will make very clear that the policy that we're talking about here is the capital cushion for bank safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.008" offset="12903424">In 1974, that became an issue because banks were failing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.679" offset="12918053">There were several large failures including the Franklin National Bank and the Board decided that at this point in time that the strict capital standards were essential to the safety of the banking system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.743" offset="12962356">The argument was made that the Board's opinion was too cursory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.486" offset="12973328">I'll refer the Court briefly to Camp versus Pitts, 411 U.S. 138.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.714" offset="12994226">This is a case we haven't cited but it deals with the adequacy of banking agency's opinion and denying an application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.662" offset="13025991">The opinion is about three years old of this Court, 411 U.S. 138.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.391" offset="13048978">And I would say in closing that the Comptroller does not have the final word here as this Court said in the Whitney National Bank case, Congress had no intention to give the Comptroller a veto over the Federal Reserve Board under the Federal Bank Holding Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.425" offset="13113031">And we think this case should be viewed from that perspective because the statute is explicit, that the Board makes this decision and the Comptroller merely advises.</text>
