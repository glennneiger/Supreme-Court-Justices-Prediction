            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">In the Derrick case, the Illinois State Board of Elections against the Socialist Workers Party did appear from the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.776" offset="43050">Under the Illinois Election Code, new political parties and independent candidates must obtain a signature of 25,000 qualified voters in order to appear on the ballot in statewide elections. However, a different standard applies in elections for offices of political subdivision of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.289" offset="129149">The minimum number of citizens required there is 5% of the number of persons who voted at the previous election for officers of the particular subdivision.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.017" offset="168020">Application is standard to a special mayoral election in the City of Chicago produced the anomalous result that a new party or independent candidate needed substantially more signatures to gain access to the ballot, that would be needed for a ballot access in a statewide election.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.462" offset="249835">Appellees, a new political party and an independent candidate for mayor of Chicago brought this action charging the discrepancy between the signature requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.726" offset="294870">The District Court enjoined enforcement of the 5% provision insofar as it mandated more than 25,000 signatures in city elections and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.088" offset="368327">By an opinion filed with the clerk today, we hold that restrictions on access to the ballot must share a compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.259" offset="405002">While States have a legitimate interest in screening out frivolous candidates, Illinois had determined that the 25,000 signature requirement is sufficient to accomplish this result in a statewide election.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.287" offset="473130">Department of the State Board of Elections has advanced no reason much less a compelling one why most signatures are necessary for elections in the City of Chicago which is a small political unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.689" offset="534674">Accordingly, we find these access restrictions cannot withstand scrutiny under the limitation clause and we affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.634" offset="582531">The Chief Justice concurs under judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.037" offset="596114">Justice Blackmun has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.554" offset="610116">Justices Rehnquist and Stevens have each filed opinions concurring in the judgment.</text>
