            <label>Mr. Frank H. Easterbrook</label>
            <text syncTime="72.672" offset="394010">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.674" offset="406026">This case involves questions about the allocation of authority to determine how long a convicted prisoner remains in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.456" offset="437164">It presents the question whether a District Court can reduce a lawful sentence if the judge determines that a decision by parole authorities frustrated the judge's expectations about when the prisoner would be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.273" offset="492440">My argument has a number of strands and my presentation may be clearer if I tell you now where I intend to go during the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.098" offset="527757">After stating the case, I will argue three propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.848" offset="542804">First, there has not been any dramatic change in the practices of parole authorities since respondents were sentenced, consequently, no ones expectation should have been frustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.143" offset="591914">My second proposition is that any subjective expectations of the judge that were frustrated in fact were not legitimate expectations because courts never had a right to insist or even expect that the Parole Commission would exercise its discretion in any particular way so that release would take place at a particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.273" offset="676446">The third proposition is that even if judges had some legitimate expectations about the date of release, they are not entitled to insist that the Parole Commission conform its behavior to those expectations.</text>

            <text syncTime="201.178" offset="908100">They're not vindicating their own rights, although there is a strong under current in the Third Circuit's opinion in this case that this case is all about the rights of judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.570" offset="941641">That this is about the right of judges to insist on release at a particular time and that it frustrates the legitimate expectations of judges to do anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.893" offset="974973">And in that sense, argument about legitimate expectations and the like responds to what the Third Circuit was talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.089" offset="999737">But I'd like to begin with a short statement of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.820" offset="1014680">Addonizio was the mayor of Newark between 1962 and 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.068" offset="1035682">In 1970 he was convicted of 63 counts of extortion, essentially of conspiring with members of organized crime to sell for money his performance of governmental services.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.109" offset="1087822">The maximum sentence on these convictions exceeded 1000 years in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.177" offset="1108093">Judge Barlow said that Addonizio had committed, and I quote “Crimes of monumental proportion, the enormity of which can scarcely be exaggerated.”</text>
            <text syncTime="261.853" offset="1150830">And he said “These were no ordinary --“</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="264.326" stopTime="268.208">

            <text syncTime="264.326" offset="1160652">What was the timeframe in which he expressed that view?</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="269.532" offset="1181550">That's when he imposed the sentence?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_h_easterbrook" startTime="271.408" stopTime="362.542">
            <label>Mr. Frank H. Easterbrook</label>
            <text syncTime="271.408" offset="1188968">Yes, when Mayor Addonizio was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.304" offset="1196596">He said these were no ordinary criminal acts but instead were, and I again quote from page 10 of the appendix, “brazen, callous and contemptuous of the law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="283.963" offset="1239228">The judge then sentenced Addonizio to 10 years in jail and said not one word about his expectations of release on parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.627" offset="1269844">The Parole Commission essentially took the judge at his word and concluded that Addonizio was no ordinary criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.112" offset="1295862">The Commission decided that because of the magnitude and organized nature of the crimes, Addonizio should serve approximately six years of the 10-year sentence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.944" offset="1339120">At the end of which, he would be released mandatorily on good time credits.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.234" offset="1360332">Judge Barlow responded to this decision by reducing the sentence from ten years to five, stating that the Commission's decision had frustrated his expectation that Addonizio would be released after three to four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.177" offset="1408084">First, the Commission had decided to hold Addonizio longer, Judge Barlow said it was necessary to reduce his sentence to achieve earlier release.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.889" offset="1442879">The cases of Whelan and Flaherty are much the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.232" offset="1452283">They were officials of Jersey City convicted of 27 counts of extortion, against selling governmental services for private gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.789" offset="1482480">They were sentenced to 15 years in prison and they sought reduction of their sentences when it appeared that the Parole Commission would hold them for a little more than seven years before they are released.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.676" offset="1526053">Judge Biunno denied relief finding that release would frustrate the sentencing intentions of Judge Shaw who imposed the sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="366.479" offset="1569311">Yes, two weeks ago.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_h_easterbrook" startTime="368.224" stopTime="651.983">
            <label>Mr. Frank H. Easterbrook</label>
            <text syncTime="368.224" offset="1576312">The Third Circuit affirmed in Addonizio case and reversed in Whelan's and Flaherty's, and it gave two principle reasons for holding that district judges have authority to reduce their sentences in response to parole decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.926" offset="1627094">First, it said, because judges have almost unlimited authority to set a maximum term in imprisonment, it must follow that the judge's expectations about the actual time to be served should be vindicated to the fullest possible extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.230" offset="1692296">A change in the Commission's approach to release decisions ha thwarted the judge's ability to achieve release at a particular time the Third Circuit reasoned, and so the only way that judges could vindicate their expectations and achieve release was to shorten sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.868" offset="1750810">The second argument that the court gave was that traditional standards of criminal justice reject the imposition of double punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.981" offset="1783306">It found double punishment here because both the district judge and the Parole Commission had taken the nature of the offense and its severity into account in making their decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.048" offset="1827610">Underlying much of the Court of Appeals' reasoning and all of the arguments of respondents is the contention that in 1973, the parole officials radically changed their approach to making parole decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.758" offset="1882363">Until 1973, they thought well behaved prisoners could expect to be released after serving approximately one-third of their sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.957" offset="1919248">After November 1973, this was no longer true, they argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.025" offset="1939519">Judges had imposed sentences, they thought, in the expectation that there would be release after one-third so that they could achieve and easily predict the date of release simply by sentencing defendants to three times as much as they really wanted them to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.633" offset="1997928">And then, when the Commission rudely surprised everyone by changing its policy requiring some people to serve more than a third, the argument runs, judges were entitled to revise their sentences to bring the actual time to be served back in line with what they had in mind to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.418" offset="2061040">The same argument I assume, would apply whenever the Parole Commission changes its policies or its guidelines, a practice that now occurs every six months to every year as a result of hearing some continuing oversight of parole practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.353" offset="2128750">But this argument really doesn't hang together.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.926" offset="2139094">It fails on a number of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.130" offset="2147871">It assumes first, that there was a radical change of policy, there was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.657" offset="2170023">It assumes that judges were entitled to set sentences in a way that achieves definite release dates, they were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.140" offset="2199907">And it assumes that there's a statutory source of authority to resentence a defendant if the original plan goes array, there is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.632" offset="2233866">And I will start with the argument that there has been a radical change in parole criteria sometime between 1970 and the present.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.934" offset="2267094">First place to start on that score seems to me is what the statutes that allocate authority between judges and the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.760" offset="2294366">The basic statutes allocating authority are unchanged between 1970 and today.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.067" offset="2315682">The principal statutes prohibit judges from setting a minimum term of imprisonment of more than one-third of the maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.138" offset="2351940">The consequence of this is that the Commission retains substantial discretion between one-third and the mandatory release date on accumulated good time credits.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.636" offset="2393945">Another statute, the statute dealing with probation, prohibits split sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.136" offset="2411917">It's a statute in which Congress is very careful.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.771" offset="2422471">When a term of imprisonment is combined with a sentence of probation, the imprisonment component cannot exceed six months, and the effect of this is that a judge can't divide up release supervision with imprisonment in a way that sets a release date at any distance in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.831" offset="2494673">There is another statute, 18 U.S.C. 4218 (d) which provides that release decisions are committed to agency discretion by law, which effectively prohibits any judicial review even on the arbitrary and capricious standard of decisions of the Parole Commission about actual release dates.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.750" offset="2570324">And there is one more rule which allocates authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.031" offset="2583489">This Court held in the Affronti and Murray cases that a judge cannot reduce a sentence after service has commenced even if he discovers that the sentence was a mistake, which was the case in Murray.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.334" offset="2636675">That rule has been changed by a federal rule of criminal procedure 35, but only by giving the court authority for 120 days, and the 120 marks the dividing line between the authority of courts and the authority of the Commission under the statutes, all those have remained constant throughout this litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="726.959" offset="3011166">One of the ironies of this case is that if you credit the Third Circuit's view that the Commission cannot consider the nature and seriousness of the offense, the Parole Commission would presumably be prohibited from releasing someone early in the sentence on the ground that the crime was trivial and the defendant didn't deserve to stay in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.121" offset="3087862">Because that entire field is prohibited by the Third Circuit's decision, it cuts both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.027" offset="3111476">In any event, the Commission in 1970 at the time of the sentences here faced substantial pressure for change.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.876" offset="3130911">It was under criticism from the administrative conference from respected scholars such as Professor Davis and from others, who contended that it was making arbitrary decisions without published standards and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.051" offset="3179604">And there was substantial desire on the Commission's part and the academic and administrative law of community that the Commission do something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.124" offset="3211891">What it did was to cooperate with the National Council on Crime and Delinquency to study its own procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.839" offset="3238745">Persons sat in at hearings that were being conducted by the Commission and tried to figure out what the Commission was doing in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.045" offset="3271555">The study found that Commission's decisions could be explained most adequately if you knew three kinds of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.950" offset="3303215">If you knew the nature and seriousness of the offense, if you knew his release prospects that is, how likely he was to commit new crimes if released, and if you knew something about his prison behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.816" offset="3350653">And of those two, the nature and seriousness of the offense and his release prospects were the most important.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.310" offset="3380642">These findings became the basis for the system of guidelines which the Commission adapted in 1973 which allowed you to look up in the table some range of dates, for example 26 to 35 months within which approximately 80% of people of a particular offense seriousness and a particular release prognosis could expect to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.041" offset="3475519">What the Commission was trying to do there was to regularize its decisions to prevent what had been perceived as arbitrary erratic and unexplained decisions, and in no small measure to control its own hearing examiners because parole policy is supposed to be made by the commissioners, rather than by the hearing examiners.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.618" offset="3545840">And if the Commission didn't have published criteria, how could the hearing examiners know what to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="866.175" offset="3568097">What happened in 1973, at least what the Commission intended happened in 1973, was the that the release criteria that had been used all along become visible and routine, rather than invisible and sporadic.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.543" offset="3625566">There's substantial confirmation for the Commission's view of what it was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.415" offset="3641031">No one should've thought in 1970 that there was presumptive release at the end of one-third of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.028" offset="3663496">The statute in effect in 1970 which we've quoted at note 14 on page 27 of our brief said that the Commission acquired discretion to release someone only if it found two things first.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.129" offset="3715845">One was that rehabilitation, or it was a rehabilitation welfare criteria essentially.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.572" offset="3749700">And the second dealt with the welfare of society.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.584" offset="3765687">The latter, we think, included considerations of general deterrence, just dissert and so on or at least the Commission so interpreted them.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.853" offset="3798810">But even if a prisoner could show that he was rehabilitated and that release was not incompatible with the welfare of society, what the statute then provided was “the Commission may in its discretion elect to grant parole.”</text>
            <text syncTime="937.213" offset="3852204">In other words, it had absolutely unbridled discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.983" offset="3867355">Nothing in the statute could've supported an inference or a belief that there was an entitlement to release after one-third of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.825" offset="3902673">The Commission, during the period at issue here, repeatedly said that it took offense severity into account, and that's discussed at pages 51 to 53 of our brief in which we reproduced some of the statements by the chairman of the Commission and the others of the commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.632" offset="3961919">If anyone had a contrary expectation about what the Commission was doing, it was invented.</text>

            <text syncTime="1379.441" offset="5621112">But before the Commission would order him to serve any additional portion of its sentence, it would hold an additional hearing to take into account what's happened in the two years since he's been released.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.857" offset="5662804">And my understanding of other cases in which district judges have ordered persons to be released and the Commission has then prevailed on appeal in the First and the Eight, and the Eight and several of the other circuits that had had this kind of litigation going on, has been that a substantial number of the persons are not returned to prison but are continued on parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.903" offset="5747022">That judgment will be for the Commission to make in all three cases here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.351" offset="5768756">But even if I'm wrong in all of this, and if you grant that there was a change in policy, I think it clear from the network of statutes and rules that we have been discussing that Congress gave the Commission the power to establish a parole policy, and that its exercise of a parole policy, its change of parole policy, is not something that can lead to resentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.017" offset="5867395">When a prisoner is sentenced, he is subjected to the Commission's discretion, that's exactly the meaning of a sentence that gives the Commission authority between the one-third point and the end of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.275" offset="5904488">A particular use of that discretion is, we submit, not a ground for complaint, even if ten years ago, the Commission would have exercised its discretion in a different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.193" offset="5948165">A judge can object to the consequences of that kind of change only if he had some legitimate ability to control the time of release.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.566" offset="5977631">But it's exactly that ability to control the time of release that Congress denied the judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.693" offset="6002186">The Third Circuit's general view, which is that because judges have absolute control over the maximum time to be served, they must have control over the actual time to be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.472" offset="6041266">It's a classic non-secular.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.778" offset="6050461">It's nothing but disagreement with the statutory policy giving one branch of government authority over the maximum and another branch of government authority over the actual time to be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.518" offset="6089435">It's almost inevitable that that kind of process is going to produce frustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.775" offset="6110438">Judges may well believe, and legitimately so, that a particular prisoner should be released after four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.531" offset="6137501">Given the statutory framework, there is no way he can hand down the sentence saying “Hold this man for four years and then release him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.030" offset="6163519">The judge must attempt to approximate, but his inability to predict correctly the error and success of approximations is, we submit, not anything that entitles the judge to claim the very power that Congress withheld, the power to set a precise release date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.409" offset="6236975">My final argument is that I could be wrong in that too, and respondents still aren't entitled to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.763" offset="6270412">No statute authorizes a court to review sentences in response to frustration of sentencing judges, even if the frustrations and the judge's expectations were legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.968" offset="6315238">This Court's decisions in Affronti and Murray established that courts can not reduce sentences after their service has commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.551" offset="6345540">And Rule 35 mitigates that only to the extent that establishing a line of demarcation at 120 days after the judgment, rather than at the beginning of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.501" offset="6393396">Court of Appeals held that Section 2255 supplies a residual source of authority to revise sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.413" offset="6425057">This we think is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.558" offset="6433625">That very proposition was implicitly rejected in Murray and Affronti, but more than that, the Court of Appeals position overlooks the limits on the scope of collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.753" offset="6478346">As this Court held in Davis, collateral review in nonconstitutional or in cases of nonconstitutional defects is available only when necessary to avoid a miscarriage of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.463" offset="6533204">But all that happened here is that respondents lawfully sentenced to substantial terms of imprisonment, had been required to continue service of those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.490" offset="6573328">No matter how you look at it, we think, continued service of a lawful term of imprisonment is not a miscarriage of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.070" offset="6607600">Respondents here should be treated no differently than other persons who are held in jail after the judge believes they should be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.610" offset="6641768">There maybe circumstances, for example a religious conversion of a prisoner that would lead a judge to believe that his sentence had become wildly inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.017" offset="6675414">And yet it seems clear that the release discretion at that point is entrusted to the Commission or perhaps to the president, rather than to a continuing supervisory authority of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.820" offset="6722644">We think that a court at that point cannot claim to use Section 2255 to produce the result that is otherwise forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.704" offset="6754200">And for all of these reasons, we submit, the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2640.276" offset="10664521">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.417" offset="10681031">I represent former mayor Whelan and former councilman Flaherty from the City of Jersey City, New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.859" offset="10714781">They too were sentenced under the, what's commonly known as the federal extortion statute for selling to the public in general, whoever was willing to buy, their favors in government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.100" offset="10775803">Unlike Mr. Addonizio, Messrs. Whelan and Flaherty were not connected with organized crime and also unlike Addonizio, they were sentenced to 15 years rather than 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.093" offset="10843721">Also unlike Addonizio, there was a tax problem that was connected to the Whelan and Flaherty case which was resolved by a plea of guilty and the imposition of a sentence to be run concurrently with the 15-year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.001" offset="10903385">Also unlike Addonizio, unfortunately Judge Shaw as presiding in a much higher court, he passed away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.487" offset="10949360">Thereafter, an application was made in the District Court for the district of New Jersey and it was referred to Judge Biunno who was presented with the problem of ascertaining under the Third Circuit rule, what was the expectation of Judge Shaw at the time that he passed the 15-year sentence?</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.161" offset="11035982">I would submit to this Court that regardless of what my brother, the Solicitor General has to say, he is after the fact attempting to ascertain what was the fact in 1970 and prior to 1970 with regard to the expectations of sentencing judges at the time that his sentence was passed upon any prisoner or any convict before a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.112" offset="11147786">And under the rule of U.S. versus Barry, the courts themselves enunciated the fact that it was commonly known that after one-third of the service of the sentence imposed the prisoner would be released unless there were factors that were present at that time to determine that he should not be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.156" offset="11247992">And I take the position that under the statutes as they were then in existence, and as they would be applicable today that they only shifted not so that it was now upon the parole board or the Parole Commission to have a burden of proof as to why a prisoner should not be released once he had served the one-third of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.902" offset="11342973">The statute that was in effect then was the statute that my clients were sentenced under and they had every right to expect that if the met the criteria, as they did, that they would be released at the end of one-third.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.069" offset="11403682">And Judge Shaw had every right to expect because that is what he had in his mind at the time that he sentenced the two individuals simply because that was what was in the minds of all the judges who were sentencing prisoners at that time, because that's what the judges said in their mind and it says so in U.S. versus Barry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2868.043" offset="11575568">All that the judge is doing at the time that he passes his sentence, or in this case at the time that he acts under 2255 to correct or modify a sentence is to vindicate the rights that are inherent in the individual to be sentenced to a term of years that is no more than the judge wanted him to serve at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.083" offset="11663653">Now, if the Third Circuit uses language that the judge was frustrated, that it's vindicating the judicial function, all its saying is that it's vindicating the rights of individuals to have the judiciary determine how long they're going to serve when it was the judiciary that passed the sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2947.482" offset="11893321">Now, you have a statute that says, yes the judge can make a sentence, pass a sentence that will say “We are going to sentence you to the discretion of the Attorney General, or to the discretion of the Parole Commission” but that's not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.253" offset="11944417">You have a classic balance of power problem, one that I haven't seen before this Court before, and that is where does the powers of the judiciary to vindicate not its rights but the rights of the individuals stop and where does the power of the executive begin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.541" offset="12017560">I do not agree with the Solicitor General that at magically at the end of 120 days, the courts have no power whatsoever to see what's happening.</text>

            <text syncTime="3413.868" offset="13758882">I think that we're dealing with a very, very narrow, narrow issue which is getting even narrower, and that is the question of what happens to sentences that were passed before 1973 when the individual is not released according to what the expectation of the court was at the time that the sentenced was passed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3445.258" offset="13884374">And I cannot see it in the 128-line, there has to be some sort of an overlap where there is some sort of a concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
