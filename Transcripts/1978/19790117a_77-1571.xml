            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">We'll hear arguments first this morning in Delaware against Prouse.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles M. Oberly, III</label>
            <text syncTime="16.882" offset="171948">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.317" offset="185637">The case that is presently before this Court for consideration concerns a very narrow question of whether police officers will be permitted to stop motor vehicles for the sole limited purpose to conduct a license and a registration check.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.762" offset="255436">The facts of this particular case are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.516" offset="270482">On November 30th 1976, an officer at Newcastle County Police Department stopped a motor vehicle in which the respondent Mr. Prouse was an occupant.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.251" offset="321369">The stop was motivated solely to check for a driver’s license and registration of the driver of that vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.816" offset="351671">There was no other wrongdoing or facts indicating suspicion at the time the vehicle was stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.010" offset="376435">Upon approaching the vehicle, the officer noticed the smell of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.149" offset="397019">A subsequent search and arrest ensued in which marijuana was found in the car and on the person of Mr. Prouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.454" offset="426172">At the Trial Court, a motion was made to suppress the evidence which was granted and the holding was then appealed by the State of Delaware to the Delaware Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.353" offset="469849">On January 30th 1978, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Trial Court’s ruling and holding that random stops without articulable facts to justify a reasonable suspicion that there is evidence of wrongdoing or unconstitutional under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.613" offset="558874">The State of Delaware respectfully disagrees with that holding and sought certiorari in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.834" offset="591684">In so ruling, the Delaware Supreme Court specifically recognized that there was a legitimate state interest in the enforcement of its motor vehicle laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.751" offset="635361">Furthermore, the Delaware Supreme Court noted that it was adopting what it called a rigid invalidity rule and the state submits that such rigid rules have been eschewed by this Court where they do exact a high toll on the public and where they can frustrate legitimate law enforcement efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.600" offset="714773">It’s the State’s position that the Delaware Supreme Court reading of the Fourteenth and Fourth Amendments, a requirement of articulable suspicion, erred in failing to apply the reasonableness test that has been used by this Court since Terry and Brignoni-Ponce.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.164" offset="793036">The reasonableness test to measure police conduct has been applied on numerous instances and it caused the Court to consider the interest of society measured against the individual rights that are involved in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.949" offset="872239">The test that has been set out caused for the Court weight the factors of the purpose and the degree of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.710" offset="899197">The public perception of the stop or seizure that maybe involved in a particular case and the alternative methods or procedures that would be available to conduct the particular search or stop in an alternative manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.726" offset="959279">After considering these factors, the expectation of privacy of the individual should be considered and the intrusiveness of that particular search.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.078" offset="1000657">It’s the State’s contention that the Delaware Supreme Court erred in failure to give full consideration to these factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.238" offset="1029392">That had it done so, that the interests of society would clearly have indicated that such stops should have been permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.848" offset="1075785">Initially the state would note that there is a legitimate state purpose in determining who has a driver’s license and who has proper registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.664" offset="1115073">There is perhaps no area of American life that is more regulated, more subject to rules than the use of the automotive vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.678" offset="1147152">When I walk out of this Court room I will be effective within seconds by the motor vehicle laws of the District of Columbia, the entire way home will be affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.739" offset="1183305">The State of Delaware and other surrounding states and jurisdiction has a paramount concern as to who can drive, when you can drive, where you can drive, who has insurance and who doesn’t have insurance and it’s submitted that this is more than just a minimal state interest, it’s a substantial state interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="301.866" offset="1311828">In Delaware a registration cannot be obtained which is kept inside the car unless there’s insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.325" offset="1337741">It’s stamped on your registration that it is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.608" offset="1350802">So in order to even get the stamp you have to show that you have insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.171" offset="1369088">In the interim, if the insurance had expired during that period of time, the state would submit that you would be able to inquire because Delaware Statute does require that all motor vehicle drivers carry a certain minimum of insurance for personal liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="1583.198" offset="6437157">The question presented in this argument is whether police officers may randomly stop motor vehicles for license and registration checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.017" offset="6480415">I think we first have to look at the facts, specifically I would like to refer the Court to some additional facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.925" offset="6508105">We do not disagree with the state’s position the fact stated in their appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.570" offset="6526704">However, there are some additional facts which I believe are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.969" offset="6540288">First of all this was a night time seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.757" offset="6555439">Secondly, the word random is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.460" offset="6574247">The Delaware Supreme court used the word random, the Delaware Superior court used that word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.406" offset="6593996">I think we have to look at Officer Vena's answer to question as to what random meant to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.696" offset="6623148">He was asked by the prosecutor, was the stop in a random manner, that was essentially the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.212" offset="6649271">His response was, I saw the car in the area and I wasn’t answering any complaints, so I decided to pull them off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.584" offset="6686783">If we define random in that way, we are using the word as meaning arbitrary.</text>
