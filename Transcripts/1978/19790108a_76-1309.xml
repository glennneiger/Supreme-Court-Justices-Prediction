            <text syncTime="76.486" offset="409266">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.830" offset="422640">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.267" offset="444479">It presents the question whether a District Court may properly suppress probative and otherwise admissible evidence of a crime merely because the government agency failed to follow internal regulations that imposed duties upon it not required either by the constitution or by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.077" offset="519711">We contend that suppression is inappropriate remedy in such circumstances; especially where as in this case, the agency regulation at issue was not intended to grant enforceable rights to individual defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.832" offset="574673">The violation of the regulation was isolated and was not committed in bad faith and the defendant has been unable to demonstrate any prejudice as a result of the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.431" offset="617096">The facts of this case may be summarized as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.683" offset="630053">In January 1975, Agent Robert Yee of the Internal Revenue Service was ordered in respondent's individual and unemployment tax returns for the year 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.004" offset="679372">At the conclusion of a meeting between respondent and Agent Yee on January 27, 1975, respondent proposed the so-called personal settlement of his tax difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.050" offset="731617">He offered Agent Yee a $1,000.00 if the agent would reduce his estimated tax liabilities by about one-third.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.952" offset="763173">Agent Yee immediately reported this bribe offer to Inspector Hill of the IRS Internal Security Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.776" offset="794520">At Hill's direction, Agent Yee called respondent on January the 30th and arranged the meeting for the following day at respondent's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.655" offset="829942">During this meeting, respondent gave agent Yee a partial payment of $500.00 for settling the tax audit as respondent had earlier suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.157" offset="867976">Unbeknownst to respondent, this conversation was recorded by Agent Yee by means of a tape recorder concealed on the agent's person.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.210" offset="904234">Agent Yee also met with respondent on February the 6th and February the 11th 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.725" offset="930252">At the February 6th meeting, respondent offered Agent Yee, an additional $2,000.00 to audit his 1973 and 1974 individual income tax returns to respondent's satisfaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.035" offset="983542">And on February 11th, respondent gave Agent Yee $500.00 as the second installment for the favorable termination of the 1971 audit.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.920" offset="1027009">The February 6th and February 11th meetings were also secretly recorded by Agent Yee.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.076" offset="1051669">The respondent was subsequently indicted on three counts of bribery prior to the second trial on these charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.302" offset="1076537">He moved to suppress the three tape recordings on the ground that they have not been properly authorized under the applicable IRS internal regulations governing consensual monitoring of face-to-face conversations between agents and taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.773" offset="1138500">Those regulations require that except in exigent circumstances advanced approval for such monitoring, must be obtained by the Director of the IRS Internal Security Division from appropriate officials in the Department of Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="286.998" offset="1251349">The approval of the Department of Justice is not required for telephone, consensual telephone monitoring, only for consensual face-to-face monitoring of conversations.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="313.463" offset="1357197">Well, the sparse history that's available to explain the reasons for the adoption of these regulations does suggest, yes, that the Internal Revenue Service and the Attorney General thought it was marginally more intrusive of possible privacy rights to have face-to-face conversations recorded than telephone conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.953" offset="1439222">The theory being that conversations over telephone are going through wires, through offices, and circuits and there's just less reasonable of an expectation that they're not being overheard.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.233" offset="1484257">Of course, consensual monitoring either by telephone or by face-to-face regulations as I'll get to face-to-face conversations doesn't implicate the either Fourth Amendment or any statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.349" offset="1528769">And the IRS manual also provides that when exigent circumstances are present, emergency authorization for consensual monitoring may be given by the Director of the IRS Internal Security Division acting alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.580" offset="1585716">Now, the facts in this case, show that on either January the 30th or January the 31st --</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="429.120" offset="1819878">Well, it's our position that the definition and interpretation of an internal regulation promulgated by an agency should be for that agency and that agency alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.157" offset="1860002">Now the lower courts in this case found that the emergency provisions of the IRS Manual were violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.462" offset="1885184">While we disagree with that conclusion, we haven't challenged it in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.670" offset="1902007">And this Court, this case reaches this Court on the assumption that the regulations were in fact violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.739" offset="1930324">The question is merely what the remedy should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.921" offset="1947042">Now, as I was saying the facts in this case show that after Agent Yee had arranged the January 31st meeting with respondent, but before that meeting took place, Inspector Hill applied for authorization to monitor the conversations between respondent and Agent Yee.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.975" offset="2019244">The request was transmitted to the IRS National Office here in Washington on January 31st but other county was not forwarded to the Justice Department until February the 7th.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.863" offset="2062817">As a result of this delay, the Director of the IRS Internal Security Division acting pursuant to the exigent circumstances provision of the IRS Manual gave emergency approval to record the January 31st and February 6th conversations between respondent and Agent Yee.</text>

            <text syncTime="507.514" offset="2133452">Mr. Geller, let me go back a moment to follow up my question that Chief Justice asked you a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.514" offset="2153409">Supposing that in a lower court case a statutory issue and a constitutional issue are both decided against the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.056" offset="2187577">The Government decides to seek certiorari but seeks certiorari only on the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.694" offset="2210147">Do you think that would be a proper attack for the (Inaudible) Office to take?</text>

          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="531.692" stopTime="544.161">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="531.692" offset="2230105">Well, I hesitate to answer that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.398" offset="2240972">In the abstract, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think that properly both that the statutory issue should be resolved before the constitutional one.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="544.161" stopTime="557.732">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="544.161" offset="2280051">But you don't feel the same problem with respect to whether or not in this particular case, the agency regulation was violated and the more general question of whether or not what the remedy should be conceding as violated.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="557.732" stopTime="742.265">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="557.732" offset="2334281">We have not challenged in this Court that the regulation was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.069" offset="2355597">I'm not aware what standards the Court would bring to resolve any question like that if the agency itself says that the regulation hasn't violated but that's part and parcel of the larger argument that we make here today that an agency regulation, the violation of a regulation standing alone does not give anyone any legal rights that are enforceable to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.528" offset="2441488">It's our position which I hope to elaborate on later the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.668" offset="2457997">But only if the defendant is worse off by the promulgation and violation of an agency regulation then he would be if the agency had not promulgated the regulation at all, might it be appropriate for the court in construing the due process clause to grant some form of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.150" offset="2535946">Now the Justice Department eventually approved the IRS consensual monitoring request on February the 10th and therefore the recording of the February 11th meeting was fully authorized in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.581" offset="2585684">In full compliance with the IRS Manual and it's not an issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.820" offset="2606686">Based on this evidence the District Court granted respondent's motion to suppress the recordings of the January 31st and February 6th meetings, the court found that no true exigency existed and that IRS agent said therefore violated the procedures in the IRS Manual by not obtaining approval from the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.446" offset="2685158">The Government appealed the suppression ruling but the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.352" offset="2708773">I think it's important to begin on discussion of this case by asking a critical question that Court of Appeals never attempted to answer and that is, what is the source of the District Court's power to suppress the highly probative tape recordings of respondent's conversations with Agent Yee merely because of the violation of an internal government regulation?</text>
            <text syncTime="673.987" offset="2799365">First, there are several -- few answers to these questions seem reasonably clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.248" offset="2816397">First, the power can't be found in the regulation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.828" offset="2834683">The IRS Manual doesn't contain an exclusionary rule and indeed it specifically provides for the wholly separate remedy of disciplinary action in appropriate cases against IRS agents who violate the manual.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.672" offset="2890062">It's also clear that the authority to suppress can't be found in the Fourth Amendment or in any federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.527" offset="2917439">This Court has said on a number of vacations that consensual recording of face-to-face conversations does not constitute a search or seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.712" offset="2962265">And Title III also specifically excludes consensual recordings by law enforcement officers from its provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.654" offset="2994030">Finally, the Court of Appeals didn't purport to be ordering the suppression of evidence here as an exercise of its supervisory powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.322" offset="3024645">And hence, whatever the legitimacy of the court ever using its supervisory powers to exclude probative evidence in a criminal case because of an agency's violation of its own rules we have substantial data --</text>

            <text syncTime="810.548" offset="3345533">Well, we took the position in the Jacobs case last year that district courts don't have any broad undefined supervisory powers and that's still the position of the Justice Department.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="835.000" offset="3443336">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.128" offset="3447933">Although in the Jacobs' case, there was a question of how United States Attorney or Strike Force Attorney should act in a particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.043" offset="3479594">Well, that leaves us with the claim that respondent urges most strongly and that the Court of Appeals appears to have accepted which is that the power to exclude the tape recordings flows from the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.462" offset="3537272">As we understand respondent's argument, he says that as a matter of constitutional due process, every agency must promulgate internal regulations restricting the unfettered discretion of its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.620" offset="3589831">Every agent, every employee must abide by the regulations of his agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.786" offset="3614490">In every violation of an internal regulation constitutes a deprivation of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.401" offset="3640926">Key assertion is obviously the last one that is that any time an agency fails to comply with one of its mandatory guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.225" offset="3676244">The person with whom the agency is dealing has been denied due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.716" offset="3694216">The respondent relies for this assertion solely upon cases such as Accardi against Shaughnessy and Service against Dulles.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.451" offset="3725145">But as the Court pointed out last term in Board of Curators against Horowitz, that line of cases merely announces a rule of federal administrative law not a principle of constitutional law applicable in non-adjudicated context.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.644" offset="3785958">And these decisions certainly didn't equate every violation of an agency's regulation whether violation of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.969" offset="3811244">Indeed, Sullivan against the United States in 348 U.S. was decided only a few months after Accardi.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.456" offset="3841233">Yet the Court failed to mention Accardi in denying the defendant's motion to dismiss an indictment in that case because of the violation of an internal agency procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.012" offset="3883447">I should make clear that we certainly don't dispute that there may be circumstances where the Government's failure to follow procedures outlined in its internal regulations might operate to treat a particular defendant unfairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.904" offset="3943006">It might cause the defendant demonstrable harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.015" offset="3959411">And that conceivably may also be circumstances in which the magnitude of the unfairness by the Government and the harm to the defendant might be sufficiently substantial to constitute a due process violation that would entitle a defendant to judicial relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.026" offset="4019493">One situation might, for example might be if a defendant reasonably relied on the existence of an internal government regulation and was then prejudiced by the Government's unjustified refusal to follow that regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.316" offset="4072678">Another might be if the government agent decided not to follow his agency's regulations in a particular case because of some invidious reasons such as a defendant's race or religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.629" offset="4121893">But in our view, if there are circumstances such as this in which the defendant would be entitled to judicial relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.954" offset="4151150">The relief would be based on the due process violation and not on the violation of the internal agency regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.118" offset="4179884">Due process, we believe, cannot be violated by a mere agency violation of its own rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.381" offset="4208933">Defendant is no worse off from a violation of an internal regulation standing alone than it would be if the agency had never adopted the internal regulation in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.502" offset="4257416">Hence, the existence of and failure to follow an internal agency regulation in our view is that most only of evidentiary significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.294" offset="4288554">But one factor among many that must be considered in weighing the defendant's due process claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.581" offset="4313736">Now, we've identified in our brief a number of the factors that we believe must be looked at to determine whether a particular defendant has been deprived of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.860" offset="4354800">The essential question of course is whether the Government's conduct is falling below a standard of essential fairness that the Court should not tolerate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.140" offset="4387924">It is as the Court defined due process in Russell case whether the activity of government law enforcement agents was repugnant to the American criminal justice system so outrageous that the Government should be barred from invoking traditional processes to obtain a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.654" offset="4462007">We think that the facts of this case demonstrate quite clearly that defendant was not treated unfairly in any way by Inspector Hill's failure to comply fully with the authorization provisions of the IRS Manual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.628" offset="4517909">Indeed, respondent really makes no effort in his brief to dispute that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.012" offset="4539434">For one thing, respondent's conduct could not have been affected in anyway by Inspector Hill's non-compliance with the IRS regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.539" offset="4577573">Respondent didn't know that his conversations with Agent Hill were being -- Agent Yee's, excuse me, were being recorded.</text>

            <text syncTime="1156.811" offset="4730650">Well, I think that Vitarelli against Seaton just like Accardi against Shaughnessy and Service against Dulles, that line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.176" offset="4756041">We don't attack the decision in those lines of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.243" offset="4768371">In this case, those are adjudicated cases and I think that the courts were announcing rules of administrative law and not due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.876" offset="4798882">I think what we're dealing with here in this type of case in the Leahey, Heffner, Sourapas lines of cases are judicial scrutiny of internal government regulations in connection with prosecute or law enforcement decision-making.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.985" offset="4855306">And I thinking that the one, the due process standard that the courts announced in overseeing law enforcement techniques is much, much lower standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.935" offset="4891146">The standard I articulated a moment ago whether the Government's conduct is so outrageous that the court should not allow judicial processes to be in foc -- to obtain a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.483" offset="4933256">We -- there are many facets obviously to the question of, must agencies follow their own rules and we're only concerned here with the small facet of the question that involves criminal investigative of prosecute of policies and whether either the dismissal of criminal charges or the suppression of evidence in the criminal case is an appropriate remedy for those types of violations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1237.206" offset="5052165">Now, respondent as I was saying didn't know that his conversations with Agent Yee were being recorded and he certainly didn't know that they were being recorded without Justice Department approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.809" offset="5090617">In his incriminating statements to Agent Yee in the January 31st and the February 6th meetings wouldn't have varied in any respect if Inspector Hill have applied for and obtained monitoring authority pursuant to the routine rather than the emergency provisions of the IRS Manual as the District Court insisted he should have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.790" offset="5174523">And by the same token, in connection with the question asked by Mr. Justice Stevens, there was no prejudice to respondent because if the IRS Manual had been fully complied with, it's absolutely no question on this record that the Department of Justice would have authorize Agent Yee to record his conversations with respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.893" offset="5250905">This is not a case in which the law enforcement technique of consensual monitoring was only of marginal utility for obvious reasons, instances of attempted bribery by IRS agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.330" offset="5300642">It has always been considered to be among the most justified uses of consensual recording equipment under the IRS regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.908" offset="5331048">Indeed, as I mentioned earlier, the Assistant Attorney General actually approved the monitoring of the February 11th meeting in advance with the knowledge that on two prior occasions earlier that week, the IRS had engaged in consensual monitoring of respondent's conversations pursuant to the emergency exception to the IRS Manual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.711" offset="5410252">In fact there had been an incident in March of 1974 in which respondent also made a statement to Agent Yee that could have been construed as a bribe offer and at that time, Agent Yee also reported this to the Internal Security Division which had sought approval from the Department of Justice to monitor face-to-face conversations between Agent Yee and back in March of 1974, the Justice Department had also grant an approval and had in fact, I think, extended that approval for five consecutive months so there's no question that this is a case in which the Justice Department would have granted approval pursuant to the IRS Manual and the Attorney General's Memorandum.</text>

            <text syncTime="1486.324" offset="6048684">I'd like to touch briefly on one more point before my time expires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.544" offset="6065507">The conclusion of some lower courts that the violation of an agency regulation alone should entitle a defendant to the suppression of evidence with the dismissal of criminal charges is premised to a large extent on the notion that regardless of the absence of harm to the particular defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.763" offset="6138441">Relief must be ordered in order to give agency an incentive to follow their agency's rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.889" offset="6162892">I think that this notion is misguided for the reasons that were stated by Judge Friendly in the Leonard case in 524 F.2d.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.692" offset="6198105">Executive branch agencies has substantial incentives wholly apart from any penalties imposed by the courts to ensure their own procedures are substantially observed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.910" offset="6243035">Executive branch agencies, presumably adopted the particular procedure which were not, which was not imposed by the constitution or by statute because it benefited the agency in some substantial significant way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.910" offset="6303013">The same factors that cause the agency to adopt the internal procedures should compel the agency and see that they're obeyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.319" offset="6336658">Even if suppression would have some marginal deterrent effect however would be far outweighed in our view by the harmful consequences that would inevitably be produced by the exclusion of the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1583.158" offset="6436028">If judicial sanctions are going to be imposed solely for violations of voluntarily adopted internal guidelines, the wisdom of adopting those practices in the first place would obviously have to be reexamined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.023" offset="6483466">Therefore, suppression would really punish society twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.773" offset="6498513">First, the probative evidence of criminal activity would be excluded and criminal prosecutions would be impeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.998" offset="6527352">And secondly, the Government would be dissuaded from adopting a great many beneficial rules and practices that go beyond what the Constitution or statute may require.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.199" offset="6568208">Thus, at the time when the Court of Appeals candidly conceded there has been a growing disenchantment with the exclusionary rule we submit that it would be exceedingly unwise to extend the remedy of suppression to the situation such as this one whether constitution and federal statutes were fully complied with and there was at most an inconsequential violation of internal agency regulation.</text>
