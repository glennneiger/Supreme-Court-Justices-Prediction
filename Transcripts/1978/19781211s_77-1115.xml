            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="6.244" offset="24973">This case is here on appeal for the New York Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.552" offset="42109">Under a New York statute, illegitimate children may inherit from their intestate fathers only if they have obtained a judicial order of paternity during the father's lifetime.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.019" offset="96026">Appellant, who claims to be the illegitimate son of Mario Lalli was not permitted to participate in Lalli's estate because he had not complied with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.117" offset="144405">The New York Court of Appeals rejected appellant's argument that the statute denied him equal protection of the law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.023" offset="188082">Our prior decisions have made clear that statutes creating classifications based on illegitimacy are invalid unless they are substantially related to important governmental interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.467" offset="241789">We think the New York statute satisfies this test.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.775" offset="259030">The states have an important interest in the just and orderly disposition of property upon death.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.930" offset="287660">Determining paternity of children, born out of wedlock often creates vexing evidentiary problems in the administration of estates following a study by a special commission, New York has chosen to require a judicial form of proof recorded during the father's lifetime.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.498" offset="373969">A judicial decree assures reliable evidence of paternity reducing the possibility of fraud, error, and delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.137" offset="416496">Nor is this an unduly burdensome method of establishing paternity.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.166" offset="436663">We therefore hold that New York's solution to this problem satisfies the requirement of the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.030" offset="476056">The Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Stewart have joined my opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.438" offset="493714">The latter adding a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.600" offset="506358">Mr. Justice Blackmun in a separate opinion and Mr. Justice Rehnquist have concurred in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.529" offset="534047">Mr. Justice Brennan joined by Mr. Justice White, Mr. Justice Marshall, and Mr. Justice Stevens, has written a dissenting opinion.</text>
