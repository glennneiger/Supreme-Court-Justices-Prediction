            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="8.151" offset="32601">This case involves a defamation action which began when petitioner, Anthony Herbert, sued Columbia Broadcasting System and two principal participants in the CBS network broadcast containing various statements about Herbert that allegedly were false and damaging to his reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.028" offset="132075">Because Herbert was a public figure as that term is understood in the law of libel and slander, his burden was to prove not only false and damaging publication but one that the defendants' knew or should have known was false.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.887" offset="191530">During discovery and in the course of taking the deposition of Barry Lando, the producer of the program, Herbert's attorney made various inquiries into Lando's thoughts, opinions, and conclusions about the truth or falsity of the material gathered by him as well as inquiries about his conversations with his editorial colleagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.964" offset="275853">Lando declined to answer both categories of questions claiming that the First Amendment privileged him to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.942" offset="307722">The District Court disagreed and directed that the questions be answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.729" offset="322873">This interlocutory ruling was certified to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.725" offset="342831">A divided panel of that court reversed holding that the First Amendment relieved Lando from any obligation to answer the questions at issue even though the answers might produce important evidence relevant to the proof of Herbert's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.351" offset="401345">We granted Herbert's petition for certiorari and now reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.894" offset="423497">In an opinion in which six of us concur, we explain that the First Amendment has not heretofore been construed to protect defendants in libel suits from answering questions about their knowledge or beliefs concerning the truthfulness of their material or about their motives for publishing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.642" offset="502491">Indeed, it has been common place and essential in libel and slander suits where conditional privileges or punitive damages have been claimed to inquire into the state of mind of the publisher.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.283" offset="553064">It has never been thought that the federal constitution was an obstacle to the introduction of such evidence and our most recent relevant cases have reflected this same understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.497" offset="597891">Because of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the plaintiff's burden in this case was to prove a knowing or reckless falsehood and we do not agree that the amendment should also prevent the plaintiff from seeking direct evidence from the defendants about a critical part of his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.995" offset="659958">We leave the First Amendment as it is and decline to construe it to create the absolute privilege for the categories of evidence involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.437" offset="697678">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.383" offset="713456">Mr. Justice Powell while joining the Court's opinion has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.179" offset="732682">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed an opinion dissenting in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.641" offset="746475">He agrees with the majority that Lando was not privileged to refuse to answer questions about his own beliefs as to the truth of the material he gathered.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.300" offset="781166">But Mr. Justice Brennan would protect against inquiry into editorial conversation until there has been a prima facie showing of falsehood as a publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.443" offset="821708">Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Marshall have filed dissenting opinions.</text>
