            <text syncTime="617.973" offset="2575235">Those are the value of the private interest taken by the Government, here a driver's license, the risk of the mistaken taking of the interests without a prior hearing, and the public purpose for which the Government is acting.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.870" offset="2630823">The Massachusetts law requires a police officer arresting a person for driving under the influence to offer that person a chemical breath -- chemical or breath analysis test.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.600" offset="2677739">The officer must inform the driver that the refusal of the test will result in a 90-day license suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.146" offset="2703966">If the driver still refuses the test, the officer must immediately prepare a written report of refusal.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.848" offset="2734791">This is possibly not a factor in the police reluctance to give the driver second chance if they do immediately perform their paperwork.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.663" offset="2766033">They must at least throw it away or backup and do the paper work again.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.719" offset="2790275">The police officer receiving the refusal must sign it under the penalties of perjury and he must forward it to the Registrar of Motor Vehicles immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.146" offset="2827995">In turn, the Registrar must impose the 90-day suspension by an immediate notice directing the driver to surrender his license at a local registry office.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.294" offset="2864567">There is no discretion left in the joints of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.580" offset="2881703">Each of these requirements is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.520" offset="2897481">At the time of the surrender, the driver can request an immediate hearing to dispute his refusal of the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.969" offset="2927261">That hearing will begin on the same day as surrender if at all possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="719.690" offset="2982118">About 15 minutes after the accident, the police arrived, arrested him, charged him among other offenses with driving while intoxicated and they accompanied him to the station house and at this point, we have the initial refusal an officer executed the report of refusal.</text>

            <text syncTime="741.324" offset="3068635">He says that he was not informed of the suspension penalty and refused on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.441" offset="3093086">The remaining facts are undisputed that the police did execute the report that the Registrar suspended Montrym, but subsequently a state trial court dismissed the drunken-driving charge on the ground that the police had refused his subsequent request.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.094" offset="3155780">Montrym's attorney informed the main office of the Registrar of the court result.</text>

            <text syncTime="1355.171" offset="5524041">The first factor is the magnitude of the private interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.956" offset="5539192">Since Bell versus Burson, it has been settled that a person's interests and a driver's license requires some kind of hearing for its deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.390" offset="5572942">However, the timing and the thoroughness of the hearing can vary according to the risk of error and the strength of the public purpose served by a license suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.734" offset="5610350">In Dixon, the Court concluded that the license interests was not so great as to require as to depart from the ordinary principal established by our decisions that something less than an evidentiary hearing is sufficient prior to an adverse administrative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.155" offset="5675969">The Court went on to weigh the chance of error and the public safety interests served by the Illinois habitual offender law and decided that a subsequent hearing typically one more than 20 days after suspension was constitutionally sufficient for the usual driver in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.587" offset="5741693">By contrast, the Massachusetts system affords a hearing opportunity often able to begin on the same day as the license surrender.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.730" offset="5778265">Even if one takes a pessimistic view of the driver's brief that a complete hearing opportunity will consume 7 to 10 days of the suspension time, that figure is drastically less than the post-suspension time spent permitted in Dixon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.833" offset="5846706">The second factor, in the court's decisions has been the risk of an erroneous license suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.338" offset="5868753">The Massachusetts statute builds in a number of safeguards against this possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.151" offset="5891950">An officer must offer the test and inform the driver of the 90-day suspension for its refusal in the presence of a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.490" offset="5933328">Upon refusal, he must immediately execute under penalties of perjury the report of refusal which must in turn set out probable cause for the original arrest, the fact of the arrest and the driver's refusal of the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.802" offset="5994559">In addition, the witnessing officer and the superior officer to whom he is accountable must endorse the report before it's transmission to the Registrar.</text>

            <text syncTime="2637.775" offset="10654490">Let me see if I can explain to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.043" offset="10659506">Let -- let me just give you just briefly two minutes of procedure so you can understand what the problem is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.886" offset="10686882">When the police officer takes its report, he sends it to the Registrar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.796" offset="10702555">The Registrar automatically revokes his license and that's what happened to Montrym's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.564" offset="10721677">Montrym surrendered his license but he did not -- but he insisted that he always maintained that the Registrar could not -- that that suspension was illegal because of the fact that he was not granted a hearing prior.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.301" offset="10792626">And that's what the class constitutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.243" offset="10800358">All those people who the Registrar sends a notice to, suspends their license without giving him that hearing first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.716" offset="10830242">And that's the central issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.242" offset="10840377">He insists upon that hearing first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.558" offset="10849573">As it turned out Your Honors, the Registrar was well-informed of the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.985" offset="10875277">The attorney that represented Mr. Montrym in the District Court, Mr. Harris who is here with me today, he sent the Registrar before the Registrar have sent the notice to Montrym as a copy of the District Court judgment and he said Mr. Montrym never refused to take the Breathalyzer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.020" offset="10935463">Here's the finding of fact from the District Court when the District Court in Massachusetts criminal court has ruled that Montrym did not refuse to take the Breathalyzer test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.778" offset="10978513">You should not take his license and I'm sending you this letter to avert his license revocation and the Registrar just totally ignored that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.994" offset="11011323">And he says, as far as I'm concerned, I have no discretion under the statute, when I get this notice from the police department that's as Montrym refuses, as far as I'm concerned, I suspend the license and that's it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.877" offset="11058866">I don't -- I'm not interested in anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.137" offset="11067956">You want to come in and talk to me afterwards, I'll be very happy to talk to you about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.816" offset="11082585">This is so happens even after he suspended the license.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.966" offset="11095228">I sent him a demand and demanded the return of that license and sent him the District Court and I explained to him about the Breathalyzer so he well knew the facts even after that stage but he refused to return that license.</text>
