            <label>Mr. Lester V. Chalmers, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="64.748" offset="362350">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.648" offset="377919">The respondent, Willie Thomas Butler, was apprehended and arrested by Special Agent David C. Martinez and other agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on May 3, 1977 in an apartment located in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.965" offset="451271">Upon an unlawful flight warrant to avoid prosecution, Agent Martinez read to the respondent from a card which reads as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.916" offset="495052">“Before we ask you any questions, you must understand your rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.751" offset="514382">You have the right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.431" offset="525145">Anything you say can be used against you in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.950" offset="543222">You have the right to talk to a lawyer for advice before we ask you any questions and to have him with you during questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.166" offset="580002">If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be appointed for you before any questions if you wish.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.669" offset="610095">If you decide to answer questions now without a lawyer present, you will still have the right to stop answering and at any time until you talk to a lawyer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="138.791" offset="658578">The petitioner asserts that if ever, agent fully complied with the prophylactic rules, as announced by Miranda, and the current policy of the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding the waiver of rights in the use of form FD 395, as appears on page 13 and 14 of the brief of the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.978" offset="763277">The respondent was not questioned at this time about any offense that occurred in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.911" offset="795042">He was transported by the agents to their New Rochelle office, about six miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.724" offset="822314">He was taken to an interview room at the FBI office in New Rochelle and then handed the advice of rights form FD 395 and subsequently asked whether he read the form, and he nodded his head and said he had.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.531" offset="897546">He was asked if he understood it and he replied he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.549" offset="917608">He was then asked to sign the form and replied that he didn't want to sign the form and stated “I will talk to you but I am not signing any form.”</text>
            <text syncTime="217.204" offset="972152">Agent Martinez further testified that he did not threaten the respondent and did not offer him any hope of reward or inducement to get the respondent to talk to him, and they did not use any misrepresentation, trickery, force, or coercion to get the respondent to talk to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.752" offset="1058356">That the respondent was in the possession of his faculties and did not appear to be under the influence of alcohol or narcotic drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.256" offset="1092420">That the respondent told him that he had 11 -- an 11th Grade education and that the respondent appeared to know what was going on about him and appeared to respond to questions in sequential fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.814" offset="1154591">Agent Martinez further testified that the respondent told him he would speak to him without a lawyer, that the respondent never told him that he did not want a lawyer present, nor did the respondent tell him that he did want a lawyer present.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.242" offset="1220315">That he, again, informed the respondent that he could have a lawyer and that one would be appointed for him if he so desired, and that he asked the respondent the following question.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.862" offset="1274859">“Will you speak to us knowing full well that you have these rights?”</text>
            <text syncTime="298.584" offset="1297742">And the respondent replied, “I won't sign the form.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.751" offset="1318327">I will talk to you but I won't sign the form.”</text>
            <text syncTime="308.163" offset="1335986">Martinez further testified that it was his impression that the respondent did understand his rights and did not necessarily want a lawyer, but that he would refuse to sign any type of paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.061" offset="1391574">The trial court concluded that any statements made by a respondent to Special Agent Martinez were made freely and voluntarily after the respondent had been advised of his Miranda rights, including his right to an attorney and that the respondent understood these rights and that he effectively waived these rights, including the right to have an attorney present during the questioning by his indication that he was willing to answer questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.253" offset="1508394">And that the statement made by the respondent was made at a time when the respondent understood his rights and that no promise or offer of an illicit nor threats or pressure or coercion of any type had been exerted against him, the respondent -- and that any statement or confession so made was freely and voluntarily given.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.558" offset="1609644">The trial court then admitted into evidence the exculpatory statements made the respondent to Special Agent Martinez.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.056" offset="1647574">The Supreme Court of North Carolina reversed the trial court and held that the evidence on board there was insufficient to support the finding that the respondent waived his rights to counsel by written waiver or a specific oral waiver knowingly made.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.024" offset="1731480">It is noted and called to the Court's attention that this interview was conducted by a trained agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and that he rigidly followed the current FBI procedures as they appear in the brief of the Solicitor General and it is further noted that Chief Justice Warren, at pages 483 and 484, commended to all law enforcement agencies the practice of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as they existed at that time with respect to interviewing suspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.208" offset="1900231">Mr. Chief Justice Warren stated that the practice of the FBI can readily be emulated by state and local agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.146" offset="1939937">And in a footnote on page 55 -- footnote 55, page 485, Mr. Chief Justice Warren stated, “We agree that the interviewing agent must exercise his judgment in determining whether the individual waives his right to counsel because the constitution -- because of the constitutional basis of the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.205" offset="2028231">However, the standard for waiver is necessarily high and, of course, the ultimate responsibility for resolving this constitutional question lies with the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.215" offset="2076191">The petitioner does not challenge the continuing validity of the Miranda decision nor any of the guidelines it established to protect what the Court said in Miranda was a person's constitutional privilege against compulsory self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.184" offset="2156126">The issue in this case is as follows, interpreting this Court's decision in Miranda in the absence of an expressed oral or expressed written waiver of right to counsel prior to questioning, does Miranda allow a finding of an implied waiver of right to counsel from the totality of the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case where the suspect has been fully advised of his constitutional rights before making voluntary incriminating statements in response to this question -- to questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.762" offset="2310457">Resolution of this question turns almost entirely on the interpretation of the three passages in Miranda -- in the Miranda opinion which the North Carolina Supreme Court, relied on in finding a per se violation of Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.761" offset="2390392">It is the position of the petitioner that the interpretation of the three passages relied on by the Supreme Court of North Carolina at page 474, 475, and 479 of Miranda should not lead to absurd or unintended results and transform the Miranda safeguards into wholly irrational objects, obstacles to legitimate police investigative activity, and deprive suspects of an opportunity to make an informed, an intelligent assessment of their entries.</text>

            <text syncTime="648.719" offset="2698219">And to answer your first question, sir, it's my recollection that every Circuit Court in the United States, including the District of Columbia and 20 of our sister states, interpret Miranda opposite from our North Carolina Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="675.234" offset="2804276">We -- Mr. Justice Blackmun, we are here, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.587" offset="2833742">What do these passages mean, as interpreted by North Carolina Supreme Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="688.172" offset="2856103">The petitioner asserts that they do not mean that an informed waiver of a right may be ineffective even when voluntarily made.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.537" offset="2893511">As Mr. Justice White said in his concurrent opinion in Michigan against Mosley, unless an individual is incompetent, we have, in the past, rejected any paternalistic rule protecting the defendant from his intelligent involuntary decisions about his own criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.890" offset="2974908">To do so would imprison a man in his privileges and to disregard the respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.160" offset="3020048">The petitioner asserts that these words do not prohibit every element which influences a criminal suspect to make incriminating admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.159" offset="3059963">As Mr. Chief Justice Burger stated in United States against Washington, the Fifth Amendment does not preclude a witness from testifying voluntarily in malice which may incriminate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.934" offset="3115133">For all his competent and free will to do so may give evidence against the whole world, themselves included.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.539" offset="3145540">Indeed, far from prohibited by the constitution, admissions of guilt by wrong doers, if not coerced, are inherently disarmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.490" offset="3197367">In addition to guaranteeing the right to remain silent and, unless in here if it's granted, the Fifth Amendment prescribes only self-incrimination obtained by a genuine compulsion testimony, accordingly, unless the record reveals some compulsion, respondent's incriminating testimony cannot conflict with any constitutional guarantees of the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.271" offset="3312410">Mr. Chief Justice Burger stated, at page 188, the test is whether, considering the totality of the circumstances, the free will of the witness was overborne.</text>

            <text syncTime="1392.583" offset="5673671">Yes, sir, and, Mr. Justice Marshall, let me say to you that we in law enforcement have no problem living with Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.693" offset="5718183">Miranda is good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.167" offset="5728005">Those guidelines are good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.914" offset="5735006">We're not asking this Court to expand them and to read into something that this Court, which we feel has not, did not say in Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.199" offset="5832182">I submit that these words do not mean that a suspect is required to execute a written waiver or expressly orally waive these rights guaranteed by Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.460" offset="5893204">Mr. Chief Justice Warren stated at page 475 of the opinion, “If the interrogation continues without the presence of an attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy burden rests on the Government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and he's rights to retain opponent counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.304" offset="5984632">This Court has always set high standards of proofs for the waiver of constitutional rights and, we assert, these standards is applied to in-custody interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.579" offset="6033638">The position of the State of North Carolina, and we assert, that is just as Mr. Justice Rehnquist stated in Michigan against Tucker, the Court said, and I'm quoting, “The Court said in Miranda that the defendant of course could waive these rights, but that any waiver must have been made voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.369" offset="6136874">We would ask this Court and we recognize fully that this Court is not bound by any interpretation of any Circuit Court throughout the United States but each one of the Circuits have interpreted Miranda, as was done in United States against Montos, a Fifth Circuit case where cert here was denied and the opinion expressed there was an expressed statement that “the individual does not require a lawyer,” is not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.572" offset="6285667">However, to show that an individual waived his right to have one present, prosecution must show that he was effectively advised that his rights have been effectively waived.</text>
