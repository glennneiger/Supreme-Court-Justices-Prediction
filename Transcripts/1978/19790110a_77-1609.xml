            <label>Mr. Joseph Remcho</label>
            <text syncTime="157.610" offset="733811">So let me get to that question then directly and take up the others later.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.824" offset="758680">The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico was created by the Commonwealth Compact, but nothing in that Compact reserved to Puerto Rico the right in any fashion to setup its own border between the United States and Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.591" offset="817716">In fact, with respect to customs, 19 US Code Section 1202(a) specifically includes Puerto Rico within United States customs territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.414" offset="861080">The Commonwealth Compact itself and the additional Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act, includes a carefully considered set of regulations and a compact between the United States Congress and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico with respect to how those two parties will relate to each other and there is nothing in that compact, which I find which specifically or implicitly authorizes Puerto Rico to setup any kind of a border between itself and the United States.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="229.298" offset="1020531">You are limiting that of course to travelers from the United States, aren't you?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_remcho" startTime="235.279" stopTime="342.191">
            <label>Mr. Joseph Remcho</label>
            <text syncTime="235.279" offset="1044459">Well, that is great, that is what the statute says, but that is what a border is all about; people coming from one place to the other regardless of whether they are residents of Puerto Rico or the United States mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.808" offset="1102555">The Commonwealth has taken the position with respect to the border not that they have the power or have indeed created anything like an international border.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.612" offset="1137768">The position they took below at least was that they had the power to create a functional equivalent of a border.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.055" offset="1163577">And I think that misconstrues this Court's cases with respect to what a functional equivalent of a border is.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.026" offset="1191476">As the Court held in Almeida-Sanchez, the functional equivalent of a border is basically the same thing as a border only for practical necessary reasons that border has been moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.837" offset="1238706">So for example, St. Louis is the functional equivalent of the United States border for a person arriving for the first time in United States and the confluence of two or three roads right near the Mexican-United States border is the functional equivalent of the border and that is the only practical place where US customs officials can conduct their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.063" offset="1327626">The defect here is in going back to your initial question is that the border search cases, which allowed even certain exceptions, which setup the functional equivalent system and allowed certain exceptions to normal probable cause, excuse me, to normal search and stop procedures, where search is conducted by customs officials and persons authorized to do that, and that by its very nature, limited the type of the search.</text>

            <text syncTime="372.734" offset="1594284">But the analogy I think as to when you can put a policeman there and when you put someone else there, applies more to what is sometimes used as inspection searches that is where State of California may setup an inspection point for pest and plant material coming in from Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.641" offset="1681951">In a situation like that, clearly they can't setup and have never tried to setup police officers to search people coming from Arizona to California, but they have had a very limited scope of authority covered by regulatory discretion for health officials to examine matter coming in.</text>

            <label>Mr. Roberto Armstrong, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1723.380" offset="6996929">I will try, Chief Justice, and thank you and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.815" offset="7022634">I believe that the main issue before this Court is whether the appellant properly raised before the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico the issue that there was a conflict meeting federal law and the non-reversal of the conviction on account of the Puerto Rican constitutional section that binds probably on the decisions based on local rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.475" offset="7225240">In this case the four justices, the four judges who decided in favor of reversal, they did not decide only on the local grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.778" offset="7270484">They decided on Fourth Amendment, of Fourth Amendment and local Article 10 rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.215" offset="7308204">There is no question in my mind that on the Ohio versus Akron Park decision, the more than simple majority requirement for wiping out a law, a statute is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.234" offset="7388348">So as far as the local law is concerned, I believe that the decision is a final and there is nothing more toward the audit and nothing that can be brought to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.798" offset="7434533">It was only apparently a decision on local rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.897" offset="7446967">However, we recognize that there is a conflict opened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.917" offset="7471000">It was a conflict between the Fourth Amendment right on which the four judges' decision is based.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.320" offset="7512691">The federal basis of that decision is the one that probably opens a supremacy clause issue that properly raised before by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico could give jurisdiction to this Court to adjudicate this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.296" offset="7592521">In other words, the case was not that -- the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico was never apprised of the existence of a supremacy clause conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.893" offset="7654902">In fact, our rationale thinking is that we want to make clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.720" offset="7690219">The appellate procedure in Puerto Rico gives appellant ten days after entering of judgment to file a motion for reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.405" offset="7748942">We agree we grant that, that was the first opportunity that the appellant had to raise the federal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.993" offset="7779349">That was the first opportunity he had to raise the supremacy clause effect on that constitutional provision that says that no presumably local law can be ruled unconstitutional except by the absolute majority of the judges, composing the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.570" offset="7889690">We believe that there is a possibility of the supremacy clause conflict because that obviously refers to local law issues, not to cases where, as in this one, the ruling is based on federal grounds besides the local ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.666" offset="7961997">So I believe that the failing to put to timely raise the issue before the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, appellant waived the right to bring the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.654" offset="8030020">Later 121 days, say he had first ten working days to file his motion for reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.241" offset="8064293">In 121 days of that appeal had been proceeded here, -- appeal is already in process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.929" offset="8107133">They filed a motion for rehearing, there is something lurking in background there, of all the constitutional supremacy's, federal supremacy's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.958" offset="8175156">Well they believe that the -- these are cases and appealed cases, these Ohio cases, Slayer versus Ohio, Riley versus Ohio they state that they were on issue, these will be raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.808" offset="8262614">It shall be raised explicitly with timeliness and in a way that there would be no question that, that issue is being raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.056" offset="8315591">On implication of a federal issue is not enough to put the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico in a position to rule on whether or not the constitutional Article V, Section 4 conflicts insofar as this case, it conflicts with the Fourth Amendment right of appellant and the matter of refrain from original resurges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.165" offset="8459995">The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico never said nobody --</text>
