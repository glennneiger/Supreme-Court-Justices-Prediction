            <text syncTime="9.138" offset="36467">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.978" offset="67814">The District Court for the Central District of California determined in 1973 that certain hiring practices in the County of Los Angeles respecting the County Fire Department violated 42 United States Code Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.881" offset="147435">The District Court in an unreported opinion and order permanently enjoined all future discrimination and entered a remedial hiring order.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.145" offset="196545">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded the clause for further consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.712" offset="234789">We granted certiorari to consider questions presented as to whether the use of arbitrary employment criteria racially exclusionary in operation, but not purposefully discriminatory, violates 42 U.S.C. 1981, and if so, whether the imposition of minimum hiring quotas for fully qualified minority applicants is an appropriate remedy in this employment discrimination case. Unfortunately, we can't reach those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.628" offset="382433">We now find that the controversy has become moot during the pendency of this litigation. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and direct that court to modify its remand as to direct the District Court to dismiss the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.537" offset="454113">Mr. Justice Stewart dissents and has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Rehnquist joins.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.675" offset="486609">Mr. Justice Powell also dissents and has also filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice joins.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.336" offset="521300">Thank you, Mr. Justice Brennan.</text>
