            <label>Mr. David H. Young</label>
            <text syncTime="10.176" offset="144071">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.157" offset="152012">May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.536" offset="161520">Today we are concerned with numerous sections of Title II of the Texas Family Court which is Texas’s effort to deal with the Law of Parents and Children.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.096" offset="219721">It's a codification obviously of many parts, it in part reflects in statute as a in case law as existed prior to its passage in 1973 and in part reflects what the legislature or what the case law in the absence of statute said the law was and it also of course reflects changes that the legislature made in the statutes and case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.447" offset="341138">Those various aspects of the family court have interplay in the sections which are before you here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.644" offset="373948">Some of the sections which we'll be discussing are matters of law that pertain to virtually any case in the civil courts of Texas and others are sections that pertain to rather more limited aspect of child abuse and still others are sections which have only to do with certain instances or certain procedures in child abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.794" offset="470497">Because of the numerous chapters and sections involved, when I am making my argument, I will try to use more than merely numbers of chapters when I am describing things, for instance chapter 17, I will always try to refer to that as to the emergency protection provisions, chapter 14, I will try to remember to refer as a conservatorship or custody provisions, likewise chapter 15, termination of parental riots, chapter 11, which is involved here as well as essentially the wholly procedural chapter and chapter 34 is involved as not a judicial per se chapter at all, it's really an investigative agency kind of chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.345" offset="668714">I would also like to utilize some of my time to very briefly state what the court below held because we are not appealing everything that the court below held and from reading the opposing briefs, it is at least my judgment that many of those briefs are on issues that are not before this court.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="164.010" offset="759411">It is possibly to briefly state what the court below --</text>

          <turn speaker="david_h_young" startTime="171.426" stopTime="555.263">
            <label>Mr. David H. Young</label>
            <text syncTime="171.426" offset="789086">I hope so, I want to try, I think it's difficult and I certainly don't want to use that part of my time doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.955" offset="835166">First of all, of course, the abstention issue we clearly are appealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.203" offset="852198">They held Section 1110 of procedural statute unconstitutional on its face because it failed to require an attorney ad litem for a child in any suit affecting a child under the Emergency Statute, the Conservatorship Statute or the Termination Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.350" offset="932760">We are only appealing that as to the necessity for an ad litem at the emergency hearing, the chapter 17 hearing, we are not appealing it as to its impact on any of the other proceedings, whether for conservatorship on a permanent or temporary basis or on termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.067" offset="1015620">They held in three sections, 1111, 1705, and 1706, that all were unconstitutional is failing to require an adversary hearing within 10 days of the emergency taking of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.223" offset="1076224">We are not appealing to any of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.655" offset="1090017">They held section 1115 unconstitutional on its face as to the standard of proof saying clear and convincing evidence is required instead of preponderance, we are appealing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.196" offset="1140172">They held 1702 unconstitutional and that saying, it was unconstitutional on its face, but saying that immediately, the statute says, a child that is seized will immediately will be taken before a court or this agency seizing the child will immediately obtain a judicial sanction if you will to have possession of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.362" offset="1240795">They interpreted that to mean that the, that immediately is the “very day” of the taking we are appealing that limited aspect of the holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.677" offset="1290115">They said that 1703 is unconstitutional on its face and that it fails to require all reasonable efforts to serve notice to one of these suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.430" offset="1337135">We are not appealing that and we would frankly characterize that as one of the more gratuitous holdings of the court below, because there is no question that all reasonable efforts should be made and were made in this instance to notify the parents of the proceedings and in fact they had actual notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.595" offset="1409755">They held section 3405 unconstitutional on its face as failing to require notice and a hearing for the parents before any psychological or psychiatric examination of the children, we are not appealing that, that wasn't even an issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.626" offset="1485928">Physical examination was an issue in this case and the court made no adverse holding as to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.138" offset="1515917">They also held the child abuse neglect reporting enquiry system unconstitutional as applied and that the state had provided for a central registry of cases of suspected abuse and those cases on that registry were not limited to instances in which a judicial determination as to the abuse have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.104" offset="1619780">Finally they held 3408 unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.835" offset="1642663">That being the confidentiality provision and held it unconstitutional and so far as it did not provide for parents to be notified of the contents of the records that the state had on them, alright or requiring the states upon request to reveal the contents of the record except for informance, we are not appealing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.229" offset="1732315">One other thing, which I think is confusing, also is that the Woods case it's my understanding it's not before this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.537" offset="1773484">It was consolidated on a limited issue of the right of indigence to reporting counsel and in their decision in this case and the judgment the court below said that consolidation was ill-advised.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.968" offset="1847254">We did not in our brief anyway cite to you what became of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.501" offset="1877347">The court allowed the state courts to proceed and in December of 1976 some two or three months, after the decision in this case was rendered the Court of Civil Appeals reversed the judgment and restored the children to Mrs. Woods that decision is reported at 545 Southwest second 573, that reversal was based on an insufficiency of the evidence kind of question.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.681" offset="2010049">That I hope gets me into what I would like to talk about regarding abstention, because in that case the Woods case the State Courts were allowed to function, were allowed to go ahead through their normal processes and what happened is that the parents want to talk about abstention, it's also necessary to spend just a little bit of time on a chronology of the events that occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.837" offset="2150693">On March 25th 1976 there was a report of child abuse at the school in question of Department of Human Resources worker went their to investigate it and the children were taken to a child welfare clinic.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.643" offset="2217984">The next day, the very next day, not the very day, but the very next day, a temporary order was obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.485" offset="2261347">Day after that Paul Sims who is the subject of this litigation really, excuse me was hospitalized where he would remain for some 10 days.</text>

            <text syncTime="577.649" offset="2414007">It's my understanding that the District clerk said judge Lowy was not present, he being the judge which had entered the temporary or emergency order a few days before that and went to see another judge to see that he would hear it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3050.177" offset="12304071">One of the things that happened immediately before the referral was made was that the father was at the school and he saw the child poking a pencil at a little girl and he told him to stop and the child did not stop and he paddled the child in the presence of the teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.308" offset="12400619">Now Paul has stated and this is not in the record that he was paddled after his father left by the teacher who wanted to paddle him some more and I would just once again say that there was no determination by the Federal district court and no evidence presented as to whether or not there was any child abuse and I suppose that that would be something that would be issued, an issue in any pending state litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3216.087" offset="12967685">The other thing is and I think that what's happening with Mr. Woods is that this shows the likelihood of what may reoccur again.</text>
