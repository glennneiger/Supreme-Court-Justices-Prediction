            <text syncTime="292.569" offset="1273605">And during the boycott presumably nearly all of them did because the boycott was indulged by more than 50% of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.834" offset="1314670">A complete -- a charge was filed with the National Labor Relations Board upon Ford's refusal to bargain about prices and services.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.403" offset="1356988">The hearing was had and the administrative law judge found that factually and legally this case was in the context of four other cases which have addressed this issue of food prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.164" offset="1424071">In each of the four other cases the National Labor Relations Board had gone one way that held that food price is worse mandatory subject to bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.727" offset="1466284">And in each case, the Court of Appeals reversed twice in the Fourth Circuit, once in the First Circuit, in the Food Machinery case and the prior decision in the Seventh Circuit in the Ladish case.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.308" offset="1524590">In each instance, the Court held that food prices properly were not within the meaning of other terms and conditions of employment but rather were remote from what could viewed as the mainstream of the relationship of employer-employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.079" offset="1619675">In support of that view may I say that over the years, this Court in one case, the Allied Chemical Workers case, circuits in other cases and indeed the Board have made these distinctions between mandatory and nonmandatory subject to bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.516" offset="1701386">It's perfectly for instance that wages whether incentive or straight hourly, overtime, seniority, holiday pay, vacation pay clearly relate to terms and conditions of employment or indeed wages or hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.076" offset="1771708">On the other hand, the decided cases hold that such matters as insurance benefits for retired employees, a code of ethics for employees coupled with penalty provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.433" offset="1841089">The right to a strike route before a strike may be called, a performance bond required of the Union not to engage in conduct contrary to the contract during its term likewise not a mandatory subject to bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.457" offset="1937220">Now, clearly Your Honors what we're dealing with here is a drawing of the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.392" offset="1968985">What properly is encompassed by the requirement of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.564" offset="1993644">Mr. Justice Stewart in your concurrence in the Fibreboard case stated very explicitly that the Act is restrictive and it does contemplated -- contemplate unlimited bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.532" offset="2053517">Indeed the legislative history supports this view rather clearly and this is articulated in your concurring opinion, the views of the Board and the unions to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.590" offset="2121749">When we're talking about food prices, we're talking about one element of the cost of living along with housing, transportation, clothing, the national agreement between Ford and the United Auto Workers over the years had has and now contains a cost of living provision so that food prices on the basis of COLA, cost of living adjustment are already bargained and what we're talking about here really would be another bite at the apple.</text>

            <text syncTime="2899.581" offset="11701687">I'm referring to the really radical exaggeration the Ford is giving vital effects test in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2926.679" offset="11810043">Moreover, it is violating the fairly clear standards that this Court has already articulated as to how to judge whether or not a bargaining proposal is a term and condition of employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3058.863" offset="12338866">Ford wants you and wants the board to go way beyond that and say a vital effect applies not only when the individuals involved are outside the employee-employer relationship.</text>
