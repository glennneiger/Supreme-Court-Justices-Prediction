            <label>Mr. William Wenzel</label>
            <text syncTime="67.710" offset="374262">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.248" offset="388368">Petitioner, Arthur F. Quern, the current Director of the Illinois Department of Public Aid, requests this Court to review and overturn the en banc ruling of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which petitioner submits has undermined this Court's ruling in this very litigation in Edelman v. Jordan, which established the stateâ€™s sovereign immunity from suit under the Eleventh Amendment to the Untied States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.039" offset="495574">The en banc ruling of the Seventh Circuit authorizes a Federal Court to mandate the issuance of a class notice regarding entitlement to retroactive welfare benefits to more than twenty thousand welfare recipients, relief, which petitioner contends is designed to secure indirectly the very same monetary award, which this Court prohibited under the Eleventh Amendment in Edelman.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.727" offset="598288">The facts in this case are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.037" offset="611558">In 1971, plaintiff filed the Civil Rights Class Action in the district court in the Northern District of Illinois, challenged the failure of the Illinois welfare officials to comply with federal time standards for processing applications for assistance under former Title 16 of the Social Security Act, the Aged, Blind and Disabled program.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.284" offset="708524">Federal regulations have been issued by the department of Health, Education and Welfare in 1968, which established specific time standards for processing applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.791" offset="750529">From 1968, until plaintiff filed his lawsuit, the defendant welfare officials had processed applications pursuant to state regulations, which were inconsistent with the federal time standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.862" offset="802774">Accordingly, the district court on April 16, 1971, preliminarily enjoined the welfare officials from enforcing their own state standards and compelled them to follow the federal time standards issued by HEW.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.032" offset="867453">In March of 1972, the preliminary injunction was made permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.340" offset="888769">In addition, the district court awarded equitable restitution for retroactive welfare benefits wrongfully withheld for all those applicants for AABD who had applied between the date of the issuance of the federal regulations in 1968 and April 16, 1971, the date that the state regulations had been declared invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.529" offset="989497">This award of equitable restitution was ultimately reversed by this Court in Edelman v. Jordan as violating the state sovereign immunity from suit under the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.566" offset="1033592">This Court reasoned that an award of equitable restitution is in all practical sense, relief against the state as the real party in interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.452" offset="1073194">This Court further reasoned that under the doctrine of ex parte Young, a federal court's remedial powers consistent with the Eleventh Amendment are limited to perspective injunctive relief and may not include a retroactive award or relief which compensates for pre-litigation conduct or past misconduct, which is completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.774" offset="1166503">This Court accordingly reversed and remanded the Seventh Circuit decision to the contrary with instructions to have further proceedings not inconsistent with the Eleventh Amendment ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.968" offset="1219271">However, on remand in the district court, plaintiff filed a motion to require the state defendant to issue a notice to each of the twenty thousand individuals or more whose applications for assistance had been delayed during the period of 1968 through 1971 and informed them of their possible entitlement to the very same retroactive welfare benefits, which this Court had denied and to inform them of their right to appeal through administrative proceedings, the denials of those welfare benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.213" offset="1376214">This was over, of course, the state's objection that it violated the law of this case as handed down in Edelman and that it violated sovereign immunity as embodied in the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.048" offset="1419577">The district court disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.215" offset="1428250">The district viewed notice relief as a relief which did not compensate per se, and that Edelman was limited to relief which compensated per se, and that this relief while related to the possibility of securing a retroactive monetary award was something different than an actual award itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.485" offset="1521351">On appeal to the Seventh Circuit, a three-judge panel of the Seventh Circuit disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.844" offset="1542771">It found that the actual notice that the district court had allowed contained a predetermination of state liability and that this sort of notice relief therefore violated the law of the case and violated the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.589" offset="1605778">Plaintiff sought a rehearing en banc, which was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.969" offset="1619257">The Seventh Circuit sitting en banc, four judges to three, decided that the district court had in fact erred in the specific notice relief that it had envisioned, because it did contain a predetermination of the state's liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.531" offset="1673488">However, the Seventh Circuit sitting en banc did feel that a Federal Court could authorize notice relief, which was related to retroactive welfare benefits, as long as it did not contain a predetermination of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.385" offset="1740884">The Seventh Circuit in authorizing this some form of notice relief conceded they would operate against the state sovereign and not merely against the Director of the Department of Public Aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.355" offset="1788844">So, the issue now before the Court is whether or not retrospective equitable relief against a non-consenting sovereign in the form of a notice related to retroactive welfare benefits is consistent with this Court's decision in Edelman or is consistent with the state's sovereign immunity from suit under the Eleventh Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="442.351" offset="1872750">How much of a case do you think we still have here in view of the majority of the en banc Seventh Circuit's opinion, which on the state's appeal, reversed the judgment of the district court, but said if the district court was so inclined, it could enter a more modest decree?</text>

            <text syncTime="464.988" offset="1963342">Your Honor, there is a case of controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.225" offset="1976299">We do have a significant controversy, because we feel that any form of notice relief under this case which will ultimately secure members of the plaintiff class, the retroactive benefits which were denied by this Court will either violate this court's ruling in Edelman or violate the Eleventh Amendment.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="488.811" offset="2058637">Mr. Wenzel as a matter of Illinois law, would the state have the power or authority to give some retroactive relief for a period prior to April 8, 1971?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_wenzel" startTime="502.101" stopTime="597.869">
            <label>Mr. William Wenzel</label>
            <text syncTime="502.101" offset="2111822">As a matter of state law, during this very period in time you mentioned, 1968 to 1971 and up through 1974 as a matter of fact, Illinois did participate in a federal state scheme of cooperative federalism known as the Aid to Aged, Blind and Disabled Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.839" offset="2190712">At that time, as a mater of state law, Illinois would have permitted people who had been denied assistance to appeal and if they prevailed under administrative appeal or if they eventually prevailed in a judicial review, would have permitted the payment of retroactive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.941" offset="2275140">This case, however, is not that simple because of the action of the United States Congress in 1974 in repealing former Title 16 of the Social Security Act and replacing it with a wholly federally funded and authorized supplemental security income program.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.941" offset="2355179">Therefore, at present and since 1974, Illinois has not been participating in a federal program.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.939" offset="2391124">So the question becomes, if a particular recipient were to seek administrative review today, and if he were to go into state court and this court were to consider the question whether he was entitled to retroactive relief, I think it would first have to deal with the threshold question of whether the state was still participating in the federal program and it is not today.</text>

            <text syncTime="597.869" offset="2494882">Well, but the district, the Court of Seventh Circuit as I read its opinion, left that completely up to the state courts to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.823" offset="2526647">It doesn't say the state courts have to award retroactive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.350" offset="2540753">It just says that this class of people may be told that they may have a claim in the state courts and remits them to the state courts?</text>

            <label>Mr. William Wenzel</label>
            <text syncTime="619.966" offset="2583280">Your Honor, we view notice relief as very closely related to an actual award of benefits themselves, but our position goes further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.366" offset="2620792">We do not view the principles of sovereign immunity nor this Court's decision in Edelman as to limit the application of the doctrine of sovereign immunity to only those cases involving an actual award of monetary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.581" offset="2689651">We believe that the principles of sovereign immunity must include those cases, which require the sovereign to act affirmatively or which triggers the operation of governmental machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.263" offset="2736462">We draw support for that proposition from this Court's rulings under the issue of federal sovereign immunity from suit in the Larson versus Domestic &amp; Foreign Commerce Corporation and --</text>

            <text syncTime="671.226" offset="2788289">Mr. Wenzel before you get too far into your argument, I want to be sure I got your entire answer to the question I put before.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.242" offset="2816293">Do I correctly summarize it by saying that if someone, whether he got this notice or not, who was did not receive benefits during the period prior to April 8, 1971 were now to file some kind of a claim in the Illinois state system, whether administrative or judicial, we don't really know whether the state would pay him anything, is that right?</text>

            <text syncTime="700.965" offset="2907199">But either result is possible as far as we know from the record and the law that you may be able to point out what is right?</text>

            <text syncTime="705.951" offset="2927156">Yes and I really did not complete my exposition of the state procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.888" offset="2950875">If I could back up to answer both Justice Stevens' and Justice Rehnquist's questions, notice relief will trigger governmental machinery and will intrude upon the sovereign state of Illinois in the following respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.116" offset="3015868">The notice will go out.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.859" offset="3022764">Twenty thousand or more welfare recipients will file request for appeals with the administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.604" offset="3057768">The agency will hold hearings themselves and depending upon the conclusion or the final decisions in those agency hearings, the recipients will have a right to seek judicial review in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.910" offset="3111058">If the state court should arrive at the conclusion that retroactive assistance should be paid to members of the plaintiff class, as a matter of state law, petitioner, the Director of the Department does not have the power to request the state comptroller to draw or the state treasurer to pay an assistance warrant, which relates to an appropriation which has lapsed.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.337" offset="3224743">We are talking here with obligations that relate to appropriations for the years 1968 through 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.955" offset="3259225">Under Illinois law those appropriation members have lapsed.</text>

            <text syncTime="808.889" offset="3338951">So isn't it possible that twenty thousand people who did not get the money they should have gotten, could establish this sort of claim and then they might have enough political influence to get the legislature to adopt or pass a Bill saying let's pay this money?</text>

            <text syncTime="828.269" offset="3416482">So, we are at the point at the court of claims perhaps even ruling in the favor of the members of the plaintiff's class here, which under Illinois law is a mere recommendation to the general assembly to pay or not to pay, but the catch it seems to me, is that the Federal Court that has issued the notice relief stands ready to intervene at any particular point in these proceedings whether they be administrative, the judicial or the legislative and use its powers under Title 28, Section 2283 to protect or effectuate its judgments, to use its powers under Title 28, Section 2202 to grant further relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1426.159" offset="5808044">Mr. Chief Justices and may I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.248" offset="5820374">The central question presented to the Court today is whether the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the state of Illinois maybe invoked by a state official as a bar to an order, requiring him to send notices to members of a duly certified class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.164" offset="5880038">This question arises as one aspect of three pronged relief, granted by the Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.127" offset="5903862">First, there has been a declaration by the Federal Court that the Director of the Illinois Department of Public Aid promulgated his own administrative regulations contrary to the Social Security Act and therefore void under the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.979" offset="5959241">Second, in light of this declaration, the Federal Court enjoined the future enforcement of these administrative regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.558" offset="5989648">These two aspects of the relief have already been held by this Court to be consistent with the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.409" offset="6017024">On remand, from Jordan I, it must be emphasized, that members of the plaintiff class were wholly in the dark regarding this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.781" offset="6054536">Accordingly, the class representative in fulfillment of his fiduciary obligations to the class, sought an order requiring the petitioner to send notices to the members of the class merely explaining; one, that a federal suit had been filed on their behalf; two, that they have been denied certain AABD benefits; three, that there were preexisting state administrative procedures for challenging the denial of such benefits and four, the method by which they might trigger those procedures.</text>

            <text syncTime="1566.577" offset="6369677">So, the notice that the respondents did seek on their behalf merely advised them that there had been this lawsuit pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.389" offset="6400920">It advised them of the declaration of the Court and then advised them of pre-existing administrative procedures by which they might challenge the denial of those benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.782" offset="6450552">The Seventh Circuit approved the sending of such notices, but only to the extent that those notices in no way predetermined the liability of the state of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.387" offset="6496946">The notices which were sent were appropriate both under Rule 23-D2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and also appropriate as an exercise of the general equitable discretion of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.304" offset="6548564">Further, under the Declaratory Judgment Act, the federal courts have the authority after entering a declaratory judgment to give further necessary and proper relief, these notices fall within that Section as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="1664.341" offset="6760782">The only question raised before the Court today is the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the state of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.891" offset="6790980">We believe a close examination of the principles of sovereign immunity and federalism embodied in the Eleventh Amendment will show that the petitioner is seeking to use the Eleventh Amendment in a way in which it was never intended and contrary to the purposes of the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.071" offset="6859630">I will first discuss the Eleventh Amendment issues and then turn to the 1983 issues presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.725" offset="6886275">In Jordan I, this Court reaffirmed the principle that the Eleventh Amendment bars a Federal Court from entering awards for money damages directly against the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.779" offset="6930474">This interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment fell within the historical purposes of the Eleventh Amendment, to protect state treasuries from Federal Court orders, both to avoid a potential clash between federal and state sovereigns and also to prevent a direct and substantial intrusion upon the sovereignty of the state by the Federal Courts, a question of federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.472" offset="7021275">Neither of these historical purposes of the Eleventh Amendment, however, are in anyway jeopardized by the sending of the notices approved by the Seventh Circuit en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.658" offset="7062026">The order challenged here by the petitioner does not result in any clash between the federal and state sovereigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.572" offset="7089612">On the contrary, the order respects the institutions of state government and leaves to the institutions of state government, the ultimate determination of the fiscal liability of the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="2644.858" offset="10682807">I certainly would agree, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.745" offset="10690330">The point was that in this case there has been a finding of a violation of federal law that this Court has upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.234" offset="10732335">So, there because of the free-prong nature of the relief, there is a finding of a violation of federal law whereas in the tax cases the entire matter is referred in ab initio to the state court system for consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.675" offset="10814046">The petitioner here does not explain how the notice relief in any way undermines federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.655" offset="10841945">Further, the petitioner cites no cases in support of his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.771" offset="10862425">The petitioner seems to suggest that the state is the real party in interest and that the notices will be a burden upon his office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.394" offset="10912998">However, it is important to distinguish between equitable considerations and the Eleventh Amendment considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.594" offset="10949778">If the class here involved only 500 persons, that is a question in comparison to the equities of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.491" offset="10989380">It is a question that this Court would weigh in the balance in deciding whether to send notices, but the Eleventh Amendment community of the state does not turn on the question of the number of persons in the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.369" offset="11052805">What is important here is for the -- is for the federal courts to provide a remedy that is co-extensive with the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.090" offset="11095751">Unless the federal remedy here of notices to the members of the plaintiff class is approved then those persons who are actually harmed by the violation of law would seek -- would receive no redress whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.322" offset="11216645">The petitioner further argues that the respondents are seeking to accomplish by indirection what Jordan wanted barred directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.655" offset="11253948">It is not true that this Court held in Jordan I that the members of the plaintiff class were to be barred from recovering.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.274" offset="11284459">What this Court held only was that the federal court could not order such recovery and therefore the decision by the federal court en banc is consistent with the original decision in Jordan I.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.374" offset="11340884">Finally, it is important to take into account also the principles of federalism embodied in Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, now codified as 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.423" offset="11389053">In enacting that provision, Congress clearly intended to provide an effective federal remedy for infringement of federal rights by state officers, just as occurred in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.096" offset="11443806">In doing so, Congress recognized that the federal courts would be (1) overriding certain state laws; (2) providing a federal remedy where state law was inadequate and (3) providing a federal remedy where the state remedy though adequate in theory was not available in practice and that is precisely the situation we have today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.877" offset="11534921">A state remedy that is available in theory, but not in practice, it is a state remedy that is only triggered by the sending of a notice and unless the members of the plaintiff clause have such notice they would be unable to utilize those procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.165" offset="11603989">Thus it is consistent with the intent of Congress in 1983 to provide for the sending of notices to these individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.247" offset="11652368">For the state officer here, to frustrate the intent of Congress there is a heavy burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.591" offset="11681729">The state officer must be able to show that the remedy appropriate under 1983 is a direct intrusion upon the Sovereignty of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.737" offset="11726346">In the absence of such a showing, the argument that the 1983 remedy should be frustrated must fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.484" offset="11785279">In conclusion then, we urge the Court to affirm the judgment of the Seventh Circuit en banc, to hold the Eleventh Amendment bars an order merely requiring a state official to send notices would be inconsistent with the historical purposes of the Eleventh Amendment, it would be inconsistent with our federalism and would be inconsistent with congressional mandate embodied in 1983.</text>

            <text syncTime="3302.106" offset="13311770">In response to counselâ€™s comments, Iâ€™d like to return to what I think are two crucial facts that are particular to this case which are decisive of the issue of whether any form of notice relief is appropriate under this Courtâ€™s decision in Edelman under the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.715" offset="13394213">Those two facts are; one, when plaintiff brought his compliant in Federal Court in 1971, he alleged that he had no available administrative remedies, paragraphs 27 and 39 of the compliant, appendix A12 and A14, he purposefully chose to ignore his right to seek a hearing in state court and now some six or seven years later he is back in court saying that now he is entitled to notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.870" offset="13534856">The second crucial fact --</text>

            <label>Mr. William Wenzel</label>
            <text syncTime="3362.843" offset="13554709">That is correct in fact, the plaintiff Mr. Justice Marshall if Mr. Jordan has received his retroactive benefits, he would not even be seeking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.858" offset="13598804">The second crucial fact I believe is that in 1974 Congress repealed former Title 16 of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.360" offset="13640808">Any right to notice or hearing which members of the plaintiff class may have had in 1971, I believe are extinguished by the fact that there are no longer any rights or obligations with respect to notice, which are binding in --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="3400.933" offset="13707055">Well, both of these propositions are propositions that maybe, that will only be considered and maybe accepted by the state administrative agencies, of course ie, that there is no administrative remedy or B if there may have once been, now Congress is repealed the law, so there now no longer is, but that is a matter for the state courts to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.148" offset="13795976">That doesnâ€™t really directly bear on the Eleventh Amendment question in this case, does it?</text>

            <text syncTime="3433.971" offset="13839235">Maybe the notice is a vain thing, may be it's futility, but that again doesnâ€™t directly bear on the Eleventh Amendment?</text>

            <text syncTime="3442.980" offset="13875284">Insofar is noticeable trigger the request for hearings, the hearing themselves judicial review, possible action by the legislative is triggering governmental machinery, which is far as we are concerned substantially intrudes upon the Sovereign and violates the Sovereignâ€™s freedom form suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.597" offset="13965772">Counsel for the plaintiff stated that the state officer is not seeking to protect the state, but to block access of state remedies and I think we have sufficiently dealt with that, for the fact that we no longer are operating under a formal Title 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.247" offset="14052394">Federalism, plaintiffâ€™s assert requires a balancing of the competing interest of the states and the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.294" offset="14092518">I think what plaintiff is trying to do in this case is confuse the notion of federalism as used in cases in Younger v. Harris, which I understand is a prudential notion of federalism, with the federalism that is inherited in every Eleventh Amendment controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.203" offset="14168168">Federalism here must take into account that the Eleventh Amendment renders an absolute bar to jurisdiction of the Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.284" offset="14204531">This Court has said so in Monaco versus Mississippi and the Eleventh Amendment must be given effect as far as it reaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.060" offset="14235564">So, it is not really a question of balancing the interest and for ever violation of federal law there must be a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.288" offset="14264508">The point is that of the suit is essentially against the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.350" offset="14280808">The state is free to assert its Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit.</text>
