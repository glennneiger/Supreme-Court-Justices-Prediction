            <text syncTime="8.635" offset="34482">This case is here on appeal from the Supreme Court of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.665" offset="58619">Under Georgia law, the mother of an illegitimate child can sue for the wrongful death of that child.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.384" offset="93518">A father who has legitimated the child can also sue for the wrongful death of the child if there is no mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.121" offset="124447">A father who has not legitimated a child however is precluded from maintaining a wrongful death action.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.175" offset="156630">The question presented in this case is whether this statutory scheme violates the equal protection or Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment by denying a father of an illegitimate child who has not legitimated the child the right to sue for the childâ€™s wrongful death.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.642" offset="234475">The Supreme Court of Georgia held that the Georgia law does not violate the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.575" offset="266240">For the reasons set out in an opinion I have filed this morning, which has been joined by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Rehnquist and Mr. Justice Stevens, as well as the reasons set out in a concurring opinion filed by Mr. Justice Powell, the judgment is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.421" offset="333636">Mr. Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion which Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Justice Marshall, and Mr. Justice Blackmun, have joined.</text>
