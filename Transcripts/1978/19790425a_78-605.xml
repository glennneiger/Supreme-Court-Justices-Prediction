            <label>Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="61.339" offset="348766">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.896" offset="362977">This case concerns a drug or group of drugs variously referred to in the record a Laetrile with a “capital L”, laetrile with the “lowercase l”, amygdalin and Vitamin B17.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.121" offset="447822">Part of the problem with this case is the difficulty of distinguishing just which drug is referred to in a particular context.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.330" offset="496724">Generically, this drug or group of drugs comprised a compound known as a cyanogenetic glucoside.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.544" offset="549595">I understand glucoside to be one of a group of organic compounds found in the kernels and seeds of most fruit that hydrolyzed or breakdown to yield glucose which is a sugar, and in the case of a cyanogenic glucoside, hydrogen cyanide as well which of course is a poison.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.133" offset="659937">Amygdalin is the name of a cyanogenic glucoside that is frequently used interchangeably with Laetrile either with the “capital L” or “small case l.”</text>
            <text syncTime="155.691" offset="726183">One other definition might be useful, one of the chemical definitions of Laetrile or proper definitions of Laetrile has been -- was made in the administered of record as laevo-mandelonitrile-beta-glucuronoside.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.918" offset="843003">I say all of that to suggest the origin of the name Laetrile.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.474" offset="865259">Laevo is the first part which means left as I understand it from the Latin and mandelonitrile is the chemical and if we take lae from leavo and the trile from mandelonitrile, we have Laetrile, and this is the drug with which we are concerned today.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.952" offset="959195">The left business, the Laevo is in contrast to dextro which would be the right rotation and it refers to the way these two drugs show up in polarized light.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.548" offset="1029517">The proponents of this drug Laetrile contends that it is a cancer cure and in some instances, a cancer preventive.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.813" offset="1082598">The process is change from time to time, but in short it appears to be the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.847" offset="1118751">It is the theory of the proponents that Laetrile releases hydrocyanic acid, which of course is a poison, and it does so in the presence of an enzyme that allegedly occurs in greater concentration in malignant cells than it does in normal cells.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.148" offset="1199940">And therefore, the malignant cells are destroyed by the action of this chemical.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.298" offset="1228570">The case comes before us is a consequence of a curious proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.549" offset="1253543">The Federal Food, Drug And Cosmetic Act prohibits the introduction of any new drug as defined in the statute into interstate commerce unless a new drug application, an NDA supported by appropriate evidence of the drug's safety and effectiveness has been approve by the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration who is the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare's designate, or unless the drug is exempted from the approval requirements by one of the Acts two grandfather provisions, one in 1938 and the other in 1962, both of which are still operative.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.209" offset="1436191">Because Laetrile had not been established as being entitled to grandfather status or is having meant the statutory requirements for approval as a new drug, the Food and Drug Administration brought a series of civil and criminal proceedings to prevent the introduction of Laetrile under various names into interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.842" offset="1530755">In March 1975, respondents brought a suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma to enjoin the Government from interfering with the sale and distribution to patient suffering from cancer of a substance known as B17, Laetrile and amygdalin.</text>

            <text syncTime="422.351" offset="1792815">They alleged that they were patients suffering from cancer and that they were terminally ill cancer patients and they were later certified as a class consisting of terminally ill cancer patients and they wish access to the drug for their therapy to be administered to them by their physicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.151" offset="1883930">The District Court issued a preliminary injunction forbidding the Government from preventing the purchase in interstate movement of Laetrile for respondent Rutherford and the other members of the class who could show by affidavit that they were terminally ill with cancer.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.272" offset="1964492">On appeal by the Government, the Tenth Circuit upheld the granting of the injunction but instructed the District Court to remand the case to the Commission for the development of an administrative record adequate under the Administrative Procedures Act, addressing the issues first whether Laetrile is a new drug within the meaning of the Act, and second if so, whether it is exempt from the premarketing requirements because of either the 1938 or the 1962 grandfather clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.189" offset="2100120">Upon remand, the Commissioner initiated administrative proceedings to a federal register announcements seeking public comment, and the proceedings which included two days of oral presentation produced more than 400 submissions and more than 5,000 pages of testimony at the conclusion of which, the Commissioner concluded first that Laetrile is a broader generic term for a group of related compounds and that in its various forms, it is a new drug within the meaning of the Food and Drug Act, and that it was definitely toxic when taken orally, that it had not been adequately tested for safety, that is was not generally recognized among experts a safe for use in man, and that distribution prior to meeting the premarketing approval of the FDA would be unlawful unless it qualified for exempt status under either grandfather provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.597" offset="2345775">He concluded that it was not exempt under the 1938 exemption, grandfather exemption, or the 1962 because the drug that -- with which was she was concerned had not been used commercially under the same or similar label for therapeutic purposes before either the 1938 time or the 1962 time which would've permitted it to continue in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.621" offset="2501883">He concluded that the distribution of Laetrile in interstate commerce is in violation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and subject to regulatory action.</text>

            <text syncTime="676.666" offset="2810023">He made a finding when he reviewed this administrative record that I've just related, which is the next step in the proceeding and what the District Court did was to sustain the Commissioner's conclusion that Laetrile was a new drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.945" offset="2875120">He agreed that it was not exempt under the 1938 grandfather clause, but he concluded that it was exempt under the 1962 grandfather clause, and in doing so, we contend improperly reviewed the evidence that was before the Commissioner, and that was properly within the jurisdiction of the Commissioner to make findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.180" offset="2992044">And then, he did a curious thing which we contend also was in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.177" offset="3016077">He held that the Food and Drug Administration had offended that constitutional right to privacy by denying the right to use a nontoxic substance in connection with one's own personal health.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.235" offset="3072293">Despite his find -- the Commissioner's finding that Laetrile has a known toxicity when taken orally and that it -- the testing is insufficient to determine its toxicity in any form.</text>

            <text syncTime="756.546" offset="3129553">Well, isn't there an additional curiosity about the District Court's constitutional holding and that he'd already found that it was covered by the grandfather clause in 1962 so it didn't have to reach that question?</text>

            <text syncTime="769.934" offset="3183156">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we agree that it was a quite unnecessary finding for the District Court to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.520" offset="3213458">But the District Court did this nevertheless.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.505" offset="3229341">The Government appealed it again to the Tenth Circuit and the Tenth Circuit without addressing the grandfather ground or the constitutional ground on which the District Court relied held as a matter of law that the safety and effectiveness terms used in the statute have no reasonable applications to terminally ill cancer patients, and that the Food And Drug Administrator had erroneously applied the Act to these persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.768" offset="3354415">Nevertheless, it modified the District Court's injunction to limit the use to intravenous injections administered by licensed medical practitioner and only to person certified by a licensed medical practitioner to be terminally ill of cancer in some form, and he directed the Food and Drug Administration to promulgate regulations within this limitation as if the drug was found by the Commission to be safe and effective for the terminally ill cancer patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.071" offset="3495685">And the matter is before this Court on the writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.532" offset="3513448">We submit that the following questions are presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.209" offset="3528182">First, whether the safety and effectiveness requirements of the Federal Food and Drug and Cosmetic Act applied to drugs intended for use by the terminally ill which is the issue on which the Court of Appeals decided the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.593" offset="3593697">We submit further that if the Court decides that question as we think it should, it would want to consider the two grounds found by the District Court for enjoining the interstate distribution of the drug, and therefore, it would consider whether the judgment of the Court of Appeals barring application of the Act to interstate distribution of the drug for intravenous administration to terminally ill patients is sustainable on the grounds that Laetrile is exempt because of the premark -- from the premarketing requirements because of the 1962 grandfathers clause, and finally, whether the judgment of the Court of Appeals is sustainable underground that the prohibition of the interstate distribution violates a constitutional right to privacy.</text>

            <text syncTime="952.873" offset="3914898">The -- we submit that the Court of Appeals is misconstrued the statute in holding that the safety and effective requirements of the Act do not apply to terminally ill persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.779" offset="3966516">In the first place, the Act makes no such exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.606" offset="3981772">There's no language in the Act that says that it does not apply to terminally ill persons and the legislative history does not support this exception that's contended for.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.305" offset="4032554">The Food and Drug Administration has consistently administered the Act without recognizing any such exception and the Congress has indicated its acquiescence in the adminis -- the way the Act has been administered because on at least two occasions, it has amended the Act without changing the construction that the Commission placed upon the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.854" offset="4142791">We further submit that there's no reliable means of identifying the class except in retrospect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1451.015" offset="5907414">It is so limited and we suggest two things from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.282" offset="5920475">First, the limitation that was gratuitous indicates that the Court of Appeals recognized the toxicity when taken orally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.372" offset="5964884">But we also suggest that it is his premise that a person has a constitutional right to use a nontoxic drug, and it would appeal then that if there is no evidence of toxicity or not, that his conclusion fails.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.991" offset="6047326">Particularly when the drug is shown to be toxic in one form and when it is clear that one of its components is a deadly poison, and no one knows whether it is released in the -- when taken parenterally, when injected instead of ingested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.437" offset="6137083">We also suggest that this Court in discussing the right of privacy has not extended it beyond protecting the individual interest in making independent decisions in matters relating to marriage, procreation, family relationships, and childbearing and education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.674" offset="6226108">In Whalen versus Roe, this Court in 429 U.S. page 600 in footnote 26 said expressly that the right to privacy did not extend to the drugs that were involved there that were subject to potential abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.173" offset="6312103">It would also suggest that the court has made it clear that even in these protected areas, the right of a person not to be regulated might be restricted in the interest of protecting the health of the person concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.152" offset="6371976">Now, we point to the abortion cases, the case that involved the saline amniocentesis method of abortion, where the court said that this wasn't the prohibition there wasn't to protect the health of the woman, but it was for a different purpose, and an improper purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.140" offset="6463927">In here, the concern if for the health would not be prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.934" offset="6491094">Also, we suggest that historically, the exercise of the police power to protect people from harmful drugs or improperly labeled drugs is far antedates the Constitution when the Constitution was adopted, this was a common practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.813" offset="6590673">In fact, we show in our appendix that it began in 1266, I guess that's 200 years after the Norman Conquest and continuously in Anglo-American history, public health has been protected.</text>

            <text syncTime="1760.050" offset="7143528">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.571" offset="7157635">I think initially it is incumbent upon me to discuss with you briefly the limitations that are imposed inherently in this case by the lower court's rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.445" offset="7197132">This case applies only to a class of terminally ill cancers patients which are represented in this case by Mr. Glen Rutherford.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.772" offset="7226493">It applies only to the application of the substance known as Laetrile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.176" offset="7244048">It applies to the intravenous application of that particular substance, and it applies to application of that substance only under the care of -- excuse me, by supervising doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.087" offset="7295770">This case has nothing at all -- no content other than that what I've just discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.661" offset="7330043">Now, the reason I mentioned that is because it has been asserted in the Government's brief to a large extent that this case Bowe (ph) is very ill for the Food and Drug Administration, and I just do not believe that is the case and I do not believe this case when you consider what is happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.873" offset="7394826">Initially, this case was brought in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma by several cancer patients who were desirous of using Laetrile were in the terminal state, and almost immediately died.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.333" offset="7444668">Mr. Rutherford was brought in as a replacement or supplemental plaintiff and at that point in time, we move the court for temporary injunction so that he wouldn't suffer the same fate as the original plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.977" offset="7487300">The District Court granted the injunction just as to Mr. Rutherford which decision of course was appealed to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.024" offset="7519483">That Circuit made a determination that in fact Mr. Rutherford was entitled to the temporary injunction, but it did not appear to that court that the Food and Drug Administration had the sufficient record upon which to base its new drug determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.563" offset="7577579">So, the case was remanded back to the District Court and a hearing was held before that District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.385" offset="7600880">At that point in time Judge Bohanon asked the attorneys for the Food and Drug Administration what administrative record had been compiled to determine that Laetrile was a new drug or that it was not grandfathered by provisions of the 62 Amendments or the 38 Amendments.</text>
