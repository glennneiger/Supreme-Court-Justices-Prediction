            <text syncTime="55.813" offset="326614">Mr. McGuinn, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. John A. McGuinn</label>
            <text syncTime="63.608" offset="357752">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.474" offset="369246">The case before you this morning concerns the subject of employee aptitude testing and whether the duty to bargain in good faith requirement of Section 8 (a) (5) of the Act requires those increasing numbers of employers, both public and private who used testing whether it requires them to turnover to Unions copies of the actual tests involved, the actual tests, sheets, submitted by the applicants and the scores achieved by the applicants linked with the name of the applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.505" offset="505396">In order to place this issue in its proper factual contexts, a few points have to be stressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.912" offset="530996">First, the test involved in this case, the Minnesota Paper Form Board Test and the six part EPSAT test are aptitude tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.552" offset="569553">It do not measure the acquired knowledge needed of a Detroit Edison Instrument Man.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.181" offset="592123">They just test the ability to get that knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.612" offset="609782">And the job involved in this case, the Instrument Man Job is one of critical importance to this company.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.120" offset="639875">This employer works on precision instruments, technically complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.332" offset="656697">He is in fact in charge of the nervous system of the power plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.923" offset="679058">Now the record in this case shows that the Instrument Man test battery is highly predictive of success on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.093" offset="707793">There is an 80% chance that those scoring above the 10.3 cutoff score will be successful performers on a job and conversely there is an 80% chance that those scoring below 10.3 will be unsuccessful Instrument Man.</text>

            <text syncTime="171.487" offset="789295">It bears on the argument of the relevance of the test items to the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.886" offset="806954">If we take it as a given that this test that this test is a valid predictor of performance on the job, I say that the Union does not need the test items themselves Mr. Justice Rehnquist in order to carry on their statutory function of representing the employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="200.406" offset="904965">Yes, the test should be turned over to a psychologist to the Union's choice for him to make a determination.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="213.173" stopTime="219.747">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="213.173" offset="956061">Well, does Detroit Edison object to the disclosure to -- what was sorted by the hearing examiner here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_a_mcguinn" startTime="219.747" stopTime="557.580">
            <label>Mr. John A. McGuinn</label>
            <text syncTime="219.747" offset="982392">No Your Honor, it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.215" offset="988244">The Detroit Edison Company in fact made that suggestion at the outset of the unfair labor practice hearing to the administrative law judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.480" offset="1017292">Exactly, the suggestion that he took, that is to turn over to a psychologist of the Union's choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.913" offset="1047071">Next, I think you must understand that this company furnished the Union with what Judge White, dissenting Judge White found was a wealth of information on its testing program.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.693" offset="1086151">This included the two validation studies done on the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.256" offset="1100361">Some 146 sample items similar to but not identical to the items on the two tests themselves an explanation of the battery weights and the raw scores on the tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.083" offset="1151666">The raw scores achieved by the applicants on the tests but not linking it with the name of the applicant just putting it by alphabetical designation and an offer to release the scores linked with the names of the applicants for any applicant who consented to such release and finally and most importantly, the offer to disclose the test to a qualified psychologist of the Union's choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.544" offset="1249573">A final factual consideration is that during the pendency of the labor board case, the Union prosecuted grievances of the unsuccessful applicants to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.163" offset="1288025">In these proceedings, the Union sought copies of the test materials that they are seeking in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.077" offset="1311640">And the arbitrator found in view of the wealth of material that the company did furnish, that production of the actual tests was irrelevant to this consideration of the case and also as the result of that proceeding, I think you should know that the arbitrator affected a compromise between the position of the Union and the position of the company whereby he told the company to reconsider three applicants who scored just below the 10.3 cutoff and as a result to that reconsideration, the company in fact hired one of those three persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.288" offset="1432534">This then is the broad factual context in which this company has found to have violated the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.171" offset="1464090">In the classical argument of this case would start with an analysis of whether the test information was of probable relevance and usefulness to the Union in carrying out its statutory duties and responsible under the Acme case.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.982" offset="1515290">Now, with your indulgence, I would like to leap ahead and assume for the moment for the purposes of argument that this information had some marginal relevance to the Union's function.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.057" offset="1559594">Our conclusion is still the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.285" offset="1568475">The test material should not be turned over to the Union directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.615" offset="1585821">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="371.982" offset="1591254">I think we could -- we should start with the only common premise we share with the National Labor Relations Board in this case and that is as the Board acknowledges in Footnote 25 of its brief, there is a very strong public policy in favor of preventing the compromised of employment tests through dissemination.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.229" offset="1672338">That public policy is rooted in the common sense fair play notion, the distribution of an employment aptitude test to persons who may take the test in the future, destroys the validity of the test as a predictor of employee performance and places those who have not seen the test at a competitive disadvantage to those who have seen the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.490" offset="1761364">In this common sense, fair play notion has been incorporated in standards for education and psychological tests and manuals published by the American Psychological Association which in turn have been incorporated into the EEOC guidelines on testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.266" offset="1820400">Now, since the filing of our brief, the joint agency guidelines on testing, Standard I-5 of the APA standards states that for tests other than achievement test, prior knowledge of the test items can destroy validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.003" offset="1875362">In Standard J-2 of those same standards states the test scores should be reported only to those qualified to interpret them.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.376" offset="1908903">And the EEOC guidelines expressly require safeguards to protect the security of test scores.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.975" offset="1939310">This Court on three recent occasions, the Griggs case, the Albemarle case, and the Washington versus Davis case has held that the EEOC guidelines are entitled to great difference and should be regarded as expressing the will of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.184" offset="2000123">This Court in the Albemarle case specifically approved the EEOC's reliance on the APA standards I've just mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.141" offset="2035963">The common sense fair play concept behind employment test security was recently underlined by the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.557" offset="2061563">In the Kirkland case where that Court struck down a District Court ruling which would have provided that any new employment test would be reviewed by the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.733" offset="2106284">The Board itself prior to this case acknowledged this common sense fair play concept when its general counsel in 1960 refused even to issue a complaint in which the Union sought to review employment aptitude test.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.845" offset="2162709">The Board's general counsel at that time referred to the “unique character” of the test and held that an advanced inspection would permit the content of the test to be widely disseminated thus impairing the usefulness of the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.744" offset="2222373">Now, the Board's sole answer to this admitted strong policy was to invent what they called a restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.502" offset="2257377">A (Inaudible) statement that the Union was not to copy the tests or disseminate them and was to return them to the company after the arbitration proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.475" offset="2293321">No restriction at all was placed on the dissemination of the test scores linked with the name of the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.363" offset="2320802">This could presumably be printed in the Detroit Free Press.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="557.580" offset="2333654">But that wouldn't compromise the test.</text>

            <text syncTime="559.821" offset="2342640">No, it would not compromise the test but it would compromise the validity as seen by the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.819" offset="2362598">The EEOC says that a test scores should not be distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.720" offset="2382242">You see, it leads to a situation where somebody who scores 12.5 on this is then compared with somebody who scored 12.3 on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.601" offset="2421739">There is no reason, as the arbitrator said, "This test is good because it doesn't compare somebody's score with that of somebody else's score".</text>
            <text syncTime="588.167" offset="2456012">It's just as reported in terms of not recommended or acceptable.</text>

            <text syncTime="638.938" offset="2659140">I can only say what the Court did in the Albemarle case and Washington versus Davies case and they said these guidelines were entitled to “great deference” and should be regarded as expressing the will of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.599" offset="2709817">Those are the Court's words.</text>

            <text syncTime="692.507" offset="2873448">Yes, like dissenting Judge White on the Court of Appeals, I can only suggest to you that the Board's position is really naïve in the real world in which we find ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.887" offset="2910960">It is really naïve because first, once the materials have been given to the Union, the company has lost control over them and it places on the company the admittedly new and very difficult burden of policing and enforcing that restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.790" offset="2978565">Second, as organizations properly responsive to their member's desires and without the professional standards and responsibilities of professional psychologists Unions are in a uniquely poor position to prevent dissemination of the materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.623" offset="3041886">In the real world of today, the ubiquitous with its copying machine which everyone has requires extraordinary measures of security to prevent widespread dissemination.</text>

            <text syncTime="967.001" offset="3971427">I think the next problem we have, I have with the restriction is that there is a built in ambiguity about this restriction, about just what individuals comprised the Union to whom I am supposed to give over these materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.354" offset="4020746">As I showed in my brief, this could be a very few people, or it could be a very large number of people.</text>

            <text syncTime="1000.103" offset="4103816">And the Board is clearly off the mark when it suggests that we, the company, could extract a pledge from these Union officials that they would never take the test in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.425" offset="4141119">I can think of no clear violation of Section 8 (a) (1) and (3) of the Act to tell the Union officials they must forego promotional opportunities because of their membership and activities in regard to a labor union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.796" offset="4190542">Fifth, even if the company were able to detect a violation of the restriction, he would have no independent remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.079" offset="4219695">It would have to rely upon the Board's general counsel to seek contempt proceedings in the Court of Appeals and its very difficult for me to consider how a Union can be held in contempt when the basic order runs against the company and not the Union and the Union wasn't even a party to the proceedings in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.607" offset="4293778">And sixth, even if the Union were found liable in contempt for a violation of the restriction, there is no adequate remedy since this company's testing program would have been gutted and would take years to make another revalidation study.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.942" offset="4355114">And seventh, if this Court were to affirm the decision of the Sixth Circuit on the basis of the judicial protective order in the sanction of contempt for its violation, what will happen next when Unions generally seek such information from other employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.767" offset="4418435">Must employers in order to obtain this judicial contempt protection refuse again to disclose the information, go through a meaningless Board proceeding, a meaningless Court of Appeals proceeding just to get the judicial contempt sanction protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.746" offset="4482382">Literally, that's the only way that another employer down the road is going to be able to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.894" offset="4498996">And yet that makes no common sense at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.939" offset="4511117">And the only other alternative would be for the employer to extract a contractual commitment against disseminating a material from the Union and the only remedy for a violation of that is an ordinary breach of contract suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.825" offset="4558660">Thus, it is apparent that even this chimera of judicial contempt sanction protection will extend no further than the case in front of you today if it's accepted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.384" offset="4612890">Let me now leap backward for a moment and talk about the threshold question of whether the testing materials involved had any probable relevance or usefulness to the Union under this Court's decision in Acme Industrial Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.919" offset="4675062">In here, we have to distinguish between the test and test sheets on the one hand and these test scores linked with the name of the applicant or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.975" offset="4711320">Going first to the test, consider first the wealth of material that the Union was given about the testing program including the validation studies themselves, including the sample questions given to the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.413" offset="4765027">Next, consider that the three professional industrial psychologists who testified in either the arbitration case or the Board hearing, each concluded that a review of the test itself would not be helpful in determining whether the particular test was valid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1608.730" offset="6538324">The administrative law judge whose findings were adopted by the Board found that the information requested by the Union, the test questions and the actual test papers and scores of the employee applicants for the Instrument Man jobs were potentially irrelevant to the processing of the grievances which have been filed by the employees who had been denied for failing to attain the cutoff score on the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.742" offset="6674369">And thus under the principles of Acme Industrial, the company violated its bargaining obligation in refusing to furnish this information to the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.711" offset="6714180">Now, before the Board, the company did not accept to the administrative law judge's finding that the test questions or the test battery and the test papers were relevant to the processing of the pending grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.690" offset="6774157">Indeed it all urged the Board to adopt that part of the administrative law judge's recommended order which provided that the tests and test papers be turned over to a psychologist selected by the Union who in turn would make them available to the Union and let it use them to the extent necessary for the processing of the grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.149" offset="6883976">The company accepted only to the administrative law judge's finding that the union needed to link the employees' names to the test scores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.173" offset="6928071">In these circumstances, we submit and under Section 10 (e) of the Act which precludes judicial review of contentions that were not raised before the Board, judicial review the question of the relevance of the test battery and the test papers is foreclosed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3496.528" offset="14089488">I do want to answer the contention made that we somehow lost our right to challenge the relevance of these materials by the lack of file and exception to the finding of relevance in the Board proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.325" offset="14156675">Mr. Come is factually correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.337" offset="14164720">No exception was filed to the -- that portion of the decision of the administrative law judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.599" offset="14185723">The reason that no exception was filed was the obvious one that the administrative law judge had adopted a recommendation made by the company at the outset of the unfair labor practice hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.450" offset="14229191">The company did this expressly “to appease the Union” not as a confession of relevance of the materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.615" offset="14261791">What earthly reason would the company have for filing an exception to that portion of a decision it deemed favorable to its own interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.443" offset="14293138">Filing an exception in those circumstances in my opinion would have been an indication of bad faith, a withdrawal from a proposal that we made to the Union at the outset of the hearing.</text>
