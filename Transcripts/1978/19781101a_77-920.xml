            <text syncTime="13.479" offset="157236">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.730" offset="174268">This case presents two issues under the Internal Revenue Code; the valuation of excess inventory and the calculation of bad debts by the reserve method formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.036" offset="231528">Both issues which are separate seem to be of high frequency and inspire considerable amount of feeling among the taxpayers involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.050" offset="279594">The principle one involves the valuation of excess inventory.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="48.216" offset="296208">I suppose it might be accurately added that they present infinite variations, is that not so?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_h_berens" startTime="55.703" stopTime="187.089">
            <label>Mr. Mark H. Berens</label>
            <text syncTime="55.703" offset="326196">They certainly do Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.994" offset="347303">The excess inventory issue is really a question of timing.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.888" offset="370918">When may inventory that a taxpayer reasonably determines to be in excess of foreseeable demand, when may it be written down?</text>
            <text syncTime="77.250" offset="412400">At the time he makes his determination or later when it is eventually scrapped as the Commissioner contends.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.202" offset="448136">The importance of this issue is indicated by the filing of very thoughtful amicus briefs by the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.416" offset="497037">The issue effects all manufacturers on the lower of cost or market method as well as wholesalers and dealers who stock replacement parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.614" offset="545834">This includes the automotive industry, farm equipment, machinery, electronics, electrical equipment of all sorts and good sound business sense requires these manufacturers and dealers to stock or really overstock spare parts if they have to serve their customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.017" offset="631411">When the parts are first produced it is very difficult and sometimes impossible to predict exactly how much demand for a part based on its wearing ability, breakage etcetera and so they are intentionally overproduced by most manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.990" offset="699329">After the part has been in use after its main product has been in use for a while, it becomes evident that the part is overstocked and at this time generally accepted accounting principles require that the excess part, the excess quantity be marked down to a net realizable value.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.326" offset="792639">And it is this requirement to clearly reflect financial accounting income that we submit should be parallelly determinative of taxable income.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark H. Berens</label>
            <text syncTime="210.445" offset="945194">By scraping and this was by an exact tracing, Exhibit 17, I believe shows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.894" offset="998902">I am going to dwell a little bit on the facts here, perhaps a little more than I should to get the proper perspective because while the facts are not in dispute, the parties interpret them quite differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.330" offset="1044668">At the end of 1964, Thor's new management determined that it's inventory was greatly overvalued.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.587" offset="1069746">After making a number of specific write downs it was confronted with the fact that it had 44,000 different items of inventory which comprised millions of pieces.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.952" offset="1119169">Most of these, 33000 different items were replacement parts and accessories, and they were held for the most part in quantities greatly exceeding foreseeable demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.835" offset="1162742">It was impractical to value these individually, and so management developed two procedures, statistically sound, fairly commonplace among manufacturers at the time to write down or determine how much should be written down.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.784" offset="1246542">The primary procedure was to compare an item by item basis, the quantities on hand with the actual sales Thor had made during 1964 or the production usage of the parts, and I stress item by item.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.532" offset="1301504">If there were no sales or use of that item they were written off as obsolete, a write off that the Commissioner accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.989" offset="1335359">If there were some usage, but the amount at hand exceeded two years usage, then that portion in excess of two years was written off.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.874" offset="1390843">Amounts between one and two years were partially written off.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.096" offset="1411741">At some locations of Thor there was inadequate data on usage for the preceding year and so additional, not substitute, but additional percentage write downs were done for a limited number of limited categories of goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.507" offset="1469419">Thor's President testified that the write downs were solely intended to accurately reflect current inventory value at the end of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.387" offset="1512887">He stated that income tax effects were not even considered at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.816" offset="1534621">The Tax Court, based on his testimony and that of several accounting experts found three specific things; that Thor's procedures for writing down the inventory and I am quoting, “the inventory in issue -- wrote down the inventory in issue to its estimate of current net realizable value,” and I stress current net realizable value.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.104" offset="1635767">The court also found that this was required by generally accepted accounting principles and it further found that this constituted a best accounting practice within the meaning of Section 471 of the Code to which I will return.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.712" offset="1702222">The findings of the court which were not disputed by the Court of Appeals nor by the Commissioner, were fully supported by the testimony of six expert accountants, five of whom were preeminent in the field of accountancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.100" offset="1775783">They testified that general accepted accounting principles require the excess inventory to be written down to clearly reflect financial income.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.707" offset="1818206">They stated that the use of a formula of this sort was essential as a practical matter and that it was commonplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.858" offset="1854777">They specifically testified that both procedures, that is the formula and the supplementary percentage write downs conformed to generally accepted accounting principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.526" offset="1901484">They testified that the write down was reasonable in amount and this was based on a hindsight basis including the degree of scraping and finally they testified that they would have withheld certification at the end of 1964 had Thor not written down the inventory as it had.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.731" offset="1982255">They further testified that if Thor had not written it down, but had waited until it was scrapped to write it down, financial income would have been distorted both in 1964 and in the later year or years when it was scrapped.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.667" offset="2054040">I want to stress, that the testimony and the findings of the court stated that this was an estimated current loss in existence at the end of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.239" offset="2100328">It was not a provision for a future loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.305" offset="2112554">Now throughout respondent's brief, the write down is characterized as an anticipation of or a reserve for a future loss, this we submit is contrary to the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.482" offset="2181308">Thor's write down is authorized, we submit, by two sections of the court; Section 446 which basically provides that taxable income shall be computed under the method of accounting the taxpayer uses in keeping his books, provided it clearly reflects income, but more directly governing is Section 471 which is the key section on inventory accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.846" offset="2282768">It imposes two conjunctive requirements, binding on both the taxpayer and the Commissioner that inventory accounting must confirm first as nearly as maybe to the best accounting practice in the trade or business and secondly as most clearly reflecting the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.619" offset="2365837">Now the Tax Court found that Thor met the first requirement, conformance to the best accounting practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.633" offset="2393945">The testimony of the experts which said that if Thor had waited to scrap it, it would not have confirmed to a best accounting practice, means that the Commissioner's scrapping method cannot meet the first requirement of Section 471.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.099" offset="2455803">It cannot be a best accounting practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.011" offset="2475447">This --</text>

            <text syncTime="594.645" offset="2481925">You have twice used the phrase a best accounting practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="602.964" offset="2515257">No, Mr. Justice Stevens, and I am quite aware of that from the (Inaudible) decision that there maybe more than one best accounting practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="616.465" offset="2569279">The statute actually says 'the', but I think it is normally read as meaning 'a' and I sometimes use them interchangeably, but I agree with you.</text>

            <text syncTime="624.101" offset="2599790">Right, but I just wanted to be sure I wasn't misunderstanding it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_h_berens" startTime="630.092" stopTime="808.149">
            <label>Mr. Mark H. Berens</label>
            <text syncTime="630.092" offset="2623718">The question then resolves did Thor's method clearly reflect income, under both Section 446 and 471? And we believe the test under both is identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.594" offset="2689755">Perhaps the best way of getting at that troublesome question is to relate the two methods to each other, and it seems a fair way of approaching it, because there seems to be no there logical point of time when the write down could occur than one of the other of these, the one side when the taxpayer reasonably determines it should be written down or later when it's scraped.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.204" offset="2804172">I cannot think of any other point of time that it could be used as a test.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.834" offset="2826742">Now, from this viewpoint, perhaps the best way of approaching is to look at the Commissioner's scrapping method.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.041" offset="2867493">Does it clearly reflect income?</text>
            <text syncTime="694.417" offset="2881076">Now, from a financial accounting viewpoint it doesn't, as was established, but beyond that, the Commissioner basically contends that to clearly reflect income you should overstate your inventory by not writing unsalable goods down to their net realizable value, and that you should hold this overstatement in the inventory for a year or two or more until whenever you eventually scrap it.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.825" offset="2982640">Now the layman would not view an overstatement of inventory to clearly reflect income, because the higher the inventory you stated, the higher the income is reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.755" offset="3038438">The Commissioner's view makes an assumption here, not only that it was a future loss but tied in that, and it's in both the lower court's opinions and in the brief of the respondent, is that inventory losses do not occur until they are realized.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.482" offset="3117328">Now, we submit and I use a strong word that this is a radical argument, it is never to our research been advanced in some 60 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.120" offset="3159855">The administrative history outlined at length in our reply brief is completely to the contrary, starting with TBR 48 issued in around 1919.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.362" offset="3204786">There are no cases that hold realization of losses of inventory are required for, and I should emphasize for a taxpayer using the lower of cost or market method for a cost taxpayer that is a different question.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.929" offset="3271137">And in particular, I cite the discussion in Space Controls 322 F.2d 147 and 148 which outlines the history of the realization issue in inventory accounting.</text>

            <text syncTime="1829.779" offset="7422516">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.286" offset="7436518">In the government view there is a fundamental issue at stake in this case which is familiar to all of us, I think in computing our tax liability and that is that a deductible loss can only be established by a closed and completed transaction fixed by identifiable events and not by fluctuations in value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.656" offset="7518020">We all know this to be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.176" offset="7524080">We buy share of stock or house that goes up in value or down in value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.155" offset="7544038">Those paper loses, so to speak, are irrelevant in computing our current tax liability, and only when we sell or exchange or otherwise dispose off the asset does the loss become fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.061" offset="7595656">Well this case involves inventories somewhat technical in nature, the same principle applies, because inventories really are simply a device of computing the cost of goods sold that is basis and thereby measuring a given year's income within the annual accounting system which is central to our tax system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.341" offset="7688756">The Court recognized this much in the Catto decision, in Volume 384 U.S., where it said, the general and long-standing rule for all taxpayers, whether they used the cash or accrual method of accounting, is that costs incurred in the acquisition of inventory may not be currently deducted, but must be deferred until the year of sale, when the accumulated costs may be set off against the proceeds of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.153" offset="7791992">In that particular case a portion of the regulations at issue here were under scrutiny, that is 1.471-6 as they applied to livestock raisers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.489" offset="7841311">Here, we are principally concerned with -2 and -4 of 1.71 and I think that with the Court's indulgence, the best way to explain the Commissioner's position is to look at the details of these regulations because these regulations have been around since 1922.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.366" offset="7960848">They were promulgated pursuant to an express statutory command of Section 471, which is essentially the same now as it was back in the Revenue Act of 1918, and they are essentially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.985" offset="8019362">If you read the old cases and you look at the footnotes, Article 1582 is virtually the same as these regulations set out in our appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.081" offset="8055724">Now the new management of Thor Power came in in 1964 and made three large scale reductions to its closing 1964 inventory, and by doing that, it increased its cost of goods sold and thereby decreased its taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.218" offset="8128240">There was a $2,750,000 write-down of closing inventory to reflect items that were scrapped as obsolete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.979" offset="8159274">There was also a $245,000 write-down to reflect some spare parts stock of unsuccessful products, and shortly thereafter, these parts were sold at reduced prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.728" offset="8206294">The Commissioner did not question these two write-downs and they are not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.912" offset="8226983">Why because in our view, there was an identifiable event that established a closed and completed transaction, that is the scrapping or the reduction of the price of the spare parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.929" offset="8283094">Now here, we have a $926,000 write-down which is essentially an amalgam of three other write-downs, but I don't think we have to go into the nature of those three other write-downs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.103" offset="8323741">We essentially have $926,000 deduction which in our view is qualitatively different from those other two write-downs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.456" offset="8353207">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.619" offset="8357804">This write-down was based on the fact that the taxpayer had estimates that this inventory was in excess of a year's demand of its customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.962" offset="8411199">Now I think the important thing to point out at the very beginning is why this was the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.775" offset="8434500">This taxpayer like all manufacturers, manufactured machinery, and had a stock of spare parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.992" offset="8459368">Now economically, it doesn't make sense and the counsel, I think, agreed and the testimonies to this effect as well, it doesn't make sense to manufacture a machine and then destroy the dyes or the tools and then when your customers who have this machine needs spare parts five years down the road to retool for those spare parts, so all the spare parts are made at once, and they are made pursuant to some estimate of what you think how long machine will be in circulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.618" offset="8581831">Now this is described as excess inventory, but I want to stress the fact it's not excess in the sense of farmer having a warehouse of oranges that are going to rot, or it's kind of glut on the market, it's a storehouse of goods which is in a excess of what you think you can sale for one year.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="3220.005" offset="12983359">Well what one does is look at the regulations which provide for a way of fixing the proper amount of the write down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.729" offset="13022333">The regulations provide -- let me give two examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.325" offset="13040724">If you look at page 85-86, there is a provision for a write down for damaged or imperfect goods, goods that have been shopworn etcetera, and the regulations provide that they should be valued at bona fide selling prices less direct cost of disposition whether you are on the cost or lower cost to the market method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.230" offset="13152319">And the regulations go on to say little further down, I suppose two-thirds the way down on page 86, “bona fide selling price means actual offering of goods during a period ending not later than 30 days after inventory day.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.098" offset="13211773">And if I may drop down a few more, “actually the burden of proof will rest upon the taxpayer to show that such exceptional goods as are valued upon such selling prices come within the classification above and he shall maintain such records of the disposition of his goods, as will enable a verification.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.538" offset="13285543">The regulations, the hallmark of the regulations,the touchstone, is independent means of verification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.191" offset="13312188">Now going on to page 87, if I may, the lower of cost or market and this sort of in a way I would like the clear up what I think is a fundamental sort of misconception advanced by the counsel and that is, that somehow market means net realizable value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.828" offset="13378644">Market and the lower cost of market doesn't mean net realizable value, it means replacement value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.006" offset="13411349">And the reason it means replacement value simply is because as I said earlier the whole process of inventories is to determine basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.425" offset="13449070">In another words, if you buys something for $100 and then two years down the road you find out that you can buy it for $50, well if the Commissioner will then say if you are on the lower of cost or market then if you went out and bought one today you would only pay $50 for it, we will allow you a $50 write down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.575" offset="13525661">But again it has to be on the basis of independent verifiable data.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.612" offset="13545827">If I may ask the Court to look at one more of these detailed provisions on page 88 sub paragraph C on the lower of cost or market it says “where the inventory is valued on the basis of cost or market whichever is lower, the market value of each article on hand that the inventory date shall be compared.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.542" offset="13621582">In another words, the Commissioner's regulation – I mean I think it's -- I don't think that it's incomprehensible to infer that there is tremendous amount of abuse in the keeping of inventories and the way the Commissioner has tried to set up these requirements for almost 60 years is to provide for independent verifiable evidence of inventory reduction.</text>
