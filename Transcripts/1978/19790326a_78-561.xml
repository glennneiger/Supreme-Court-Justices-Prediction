            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="55.817" offset="326614">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.488" offset="341347">This case is here on the Government's petition for certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.253" offset="372381">The Eighth Circuit set aside the District Court's judgment which had convicted the respondent on eight counts of securities fraud under Section 17 (a) (1) of the Securities Act of 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.390" offset="424939">The question presented in this case is whether Section 17 (a) (1) prohibits frauds practiced by customers on their brokers during the course of offering or selling securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.526" offset="473527">We contend that Section 17 (a) (1) applies to all frauds occurring during the process of offering or selling, including those frauds that injure brokerage houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.907" offset="518980">The facts of this case can be summarized rather briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.530" offset="537475">In July and August 1969, the respondent placed sell orders with five different brokerage houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.627" offset="565896">Those orders in each case were for large blocks of either 500 or 1,000 shares of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.239" offset="592332">The respondent had cash accounts with each of these firms and was not permitted to make short sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.199" offset="616155">In each of the sales, he either stated affirmatively that his position was long or he used words or phrases which would indicate that his position was long.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.744" offset="654399">In fact, however, respondent did not own any of the stock that he sold. His position was short rather than long, contrary to his representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.207" offset="696195">He planned to buy the stock at some later point in time in the declining market and to make a delayed delivery to the brokerage house.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.973" offset="727228">His profit would be the difference between the price at which he originally sold and the price at which he later covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.883" offset="754918">But contrary to his expectations, the price of all of these securities went up substantially and he was unable to make covering purchases and for that reason he never delivered any of the stock that he sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.978" offset="807267">Under the SEC's rules the brokers were required to cover for respondent's sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.950" offset="831195">At first when they were still expecting him to make delivery, they forwarded the borrowed securities on his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.584" offset="857736">When he later confessed to the details of this scheme, the brokers were required to buy in the stock at their own expense, resulting in substantial losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.368" offset="900890">Due to respondent's deception, the risk inherent in the short selling scheme was shifted from himself to the brokers.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.547" offset="929520">Because they believed he was selling long, none of them obtained a margin deposit that would have protected them against the failure to make delivery on his part.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.084" offset="967659">The District Court found that respondent's misrepresentations violated Section 17 (a) (1) of the statute and convicted him on all eight counts of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.659" offset="1009977">The Court of Appeals agreed that the respondent had committed fraud and had injured the brokerage houses, but it concluded that Section 17 (a) (1) is not violated by the species of fraud which was practiced against brokers rather than purchasers of securities and on that theory the court reversed respondent's conviction on all of the counts of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.979" offset="1099316">We contend that Section 17 (a) (1) applies to the species of fraud used here and we rely on the text of the statute in making that contention.</text>

            <text syncTime="265.519" offset="1165458">It might well have been filed under Section 10 (b) of the 1934 Act because there was fraud used in connection with the sale.</text>

          <turn speaker="stephen_m_shapiro" startTime="279.130" stopTime="403.111">
            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="279.130" offset="1219897">We don't feel that it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.322" offset="1224704">We think the most logical choice for this prosecution was 17 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="285.110" offset="1243826">A -- a fraud was used in an offer and in a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.897" offset="1258977">And as the Blue Chips Stamps opinion points out, Section 10 (b) does not explicitly extend to frauds in an offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.594" offset="1289697">The indictment here charged fraud in both the offer and the sale process and for that reason Section 17 (a) was the logical choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.548" offset="1325537">17 (a) is the traditional criminal law provision used in prosecutions based on fraudulent selling schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.237" offset="1356361">It's used in by far the larger part of the cases raising frauds in this particular context.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.326" offset="1388648">Now, respondent admittedly committed fraud by making statements of the following kind: sell long 1,000 shares at market.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.833" offset="1422712">When he made that statement, he was short rather than long and we say that this misrepresentation occurred in a sale because it was made by the seller at the very time that he placed the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.239" offset="1468374">The seller told a lie in the very same communication that triggered the contract of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.535" offset="1493556">The definitions in the statute make that conclusion emphatic.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.477" offset="1509230">The statute says that a sale includes every disposition of a security for value, and the dictionary definition of disposition is simply the action of getting rid of something or parting with something.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.069" offset="1559698">Now, giving these words their ordinary meaning, the respondent committed fraud in the disposition of securities when he placed fraudulent orders to sell those securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.415" offset="1601076">The definition of offer contained in the statute is even more expansive than the definition of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.573" offset="1629706">An offer includes every attempt to dispose of a security for value.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.545" offset="1649560">Now, when respondent called his brokers and ordered them to sell at market, he was obviously attempting to dispose of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.591" offset="1681742">And since this fraud occurred while he made that attempt to sell, we say that the fraud occurred in his offer and a violation of the statute resulted.</text>

            <text syncTime="413.544" offset="1757497">It was strictly a question of the scope of Section 17 (a) (1).</text>

            <text syncTime="419.626" offset="1781844">Yes, Your Honor, Judge Larson.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.970" offset="1791248">A few more thoughts about the literal text of the statute may be helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.102" offset="1807757">Section 17 (a) (1) nowhere limits the class of victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.290" offset="1824580">It extends to any scheme to defraud, like the mail fraud statute, which is the basis for Section 17 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="437.852" offset="1854777">The victim can be anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.679" offset="1862092">Indeed, the case law makes it clear that there doesn't have to be any victim at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.905" offset="1879019">The scheme to defraud is itself illegal if it is practiced in the protected medium, that is the process of offering or selling a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.298" offset="1912560">And the statute does not say that the fraud must occur in a particular phase of the sale or in a particular phase of the offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.168" offset="1944012">The sale transaction, of course, consists of a series of events.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.773" offset="1958431">There is the order to sell, there is the execution, there is the confirmation, and in the ordinary course there is the delivery of securities and the payment of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.084" offset="1991659">But the statute does not say that the fraud must occur at a particular point in this process, and it certainly does not say that it must extend all the way from the seller through the anonymous exchange process to the purchaser on the other side of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.954" offset="2055189">The common sense of our position is illustrated, I think, by a single example.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.941" offset="2079117">If a broker acting merely as an agent committed a fraud on a customer in the process of selling, no one would doubt that that was a fraud in a sale within the prohibition of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.657" offset="2126033">And we say that it makes no difference if you turn the case around and have a case of the customer defrauding the broker.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.948" offset="2155186">The locus of the fraud is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.024" offset="2163440">It still occurs in the sale process, and we submit that there is no basis for the conclusion that brokerage firms participating as intermediaries in the sale process are not subject to the protections as well as the prohibitions of Section 17 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="532.509" offset="2233448">The Court of Appeals, nonetheless believe that it was proper to narrowly construe Section 17 (a) (1) because of its view of legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.643" offset="2273991">The court thought that Congress' sole purpose in enacting this statute was to protect investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.141" offset="2299904">We submit that that ignores numerous statements of legislative intent to the contrary and it ignores the economic problem that Congress was attempting to grapple with in 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.614" offset="2349850">This statute was passed in the depths of the depression as a means to revitalize the economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.595" offset="2373778">The market crash of 1929 had left many investors penniless and had practically wrecked many American business firms, in the words of the Congressmen who debated this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.535" offset="2417560">Securities fraud contributed to these conditions and Congress --</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="602.016" offset="2511391">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.591" offset="2513690">The Court of Appeals felt that the legislative history pointed the other way and we would like to point out it is supportive of our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.931" offset="2543052">Congress intended to eliminate securities fraud in order to remedy the economic conditions that it pointed to in the debates on this measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.182" offset="2576071">The beneficiaries of that prohibition were explicitly identified as follows, and I quote from the Senate Report, “The purpose of this bill is to protect the investing public and honest business.”</text>
            <text syncTime="631.431" offset="2629047">The House Report stated that business injury was equally as significant as the loss suffered by investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.572" offset="2657677">In short, Congress was trying to protect the national economy overall, including both public investors and the business firms that participated in our nation's economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.613" offset="2701876">There is not a hint in any of the debates or the reports that Congress intended to protect investors only or that it was unconcerned with injuries suffered by business firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.475" offset="2753285">Respondent's citation of legislative history showing that Congress intended to protect investors is quite beside the point, we respectfully submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.588" offset="2789752">We would be the first to affirm that Congress intended to protect investors, but we deny that that was the only purpose and respondent cites nothing that suggests that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.778" offset="2834474">In recent securities cases, such as Hochfelder and Blue Chip Stamps against Manor Drug Stores, this Court has contrasted the statutory provision under consideration with other neighboring provisions to get a clear view on its coverage or its scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.798" offset="2910542">That technique is helpful here.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.029" offset="2919528">Section 17 (a) contains three separate subdivisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.974" offset="2935306">They are each expressed in the disjunctive and each is a prohibition against fraudulent conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.535" offset="2961533">Section 17(a) (1) is the broadest provision, forbidding any fraud in an offer or in a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.851" offset="2990791">Section 17(a) (3), in contrast, is a more limited provision, dealing narrowly with fraud practiced on purchasers of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.010" offset="3027362">This difference shows that when Congress intended to cover purchaser fraud, it knew how to do so explicitly and it did do so explicitly.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.445" offset="3065187">This Court's decision in the case of United States against Gilliland, which we have cited in our opening and reply briefs, demonstrates the proper analysis of this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.241" offset="3108342">In that case, the Court considered a provision in the Criminal Code which prohibited the filing of any false report with a government agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.980" offset="3139271">In the same sentence, and stated in the disjunctive, was a prohibition against filing any false claim or bill or voucher demanding money from the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.116" offset="3179813">The defendant there made the same argument that the defendant makes here, that the general prohibition should be circumscribed by the narrower prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.538" offset="3213563">This Court rejected that argument in words that are directly applicable here, and I quote: “The rule of ejusdem generis is a familiar and useful one.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.954" offset="3255150">But it gives no warrant for narrowing alternative provisions which the legislature has adopted with the purpose of affording added safeguards.”</text>
            <text syncTime="797.534" offset="3293497">That principle, we submit, is directly applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.874" offset="3306872">Section 17 (a) (1) and 17 (a) (3) are alternative prohibitions which taken together provide comprehensive protection against fraud, and there is no justification for contracting these complementary provisions into a single narrow prohibition dealing only with fraud on purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.846" offset="3390777">Respondent is perfectly candid in the position that he takes about the fraud in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.636" offset="3417945">He doesn't deny that he committed fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.087" offset="3427767">He doesn't deny that he injured the brokerage houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.927" offset="3439052">And he doesn't even deny that he violated the federal securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.000" offset="3455352">He contends, however, that the prosecutor made a mistake, that the prosecutor was duty-bound to pursue him under Section 10 of the 1934 Act, rather than Section 17 of the 1933 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.564" offset="3505612">But as I mentioned previously to Mr. Justice Blackmun, 17 (a) (1) was not only an allowable choice, it was the most logical choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.815" offset="3538631">It deals squarely with the thing charged in the indictment, fraud in an offer and fraud in a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.968" offset="3563290">I don't mean to suggest by this analysis that respondent did not transgress various different provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.408" offset="3588995">I assume that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.943" offset="3595160">I think he violated Section 10 (b) when he used fraud in connection with a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.758" offset="3614386">I think he violated Section 10 (a) when he caused a short sale to be effected in a declining market, contrary to the SEC's rules, and I think he probably violated the mail fraud statute because he used a fraudulent scheme and caused the mails to be used in conjunction with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.468" offset="3681259">But it is quite commonplace for a complex criminal scheme to run afoul of different statutory provisions, and when it does this Court's decisions teach that the discretion rests with the prosecutor to select the appropriate charge and that is a broad discretion according to the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.348" offset="3760776">Respondent has also argued that the decision below must be affirmed because criminal laws should be construed with lenity, but the rule of lenity applies to statutes that contain serious ambiguities which do not afford fair notice to the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.437" offset="3833083">This statute clearly conveys the congressional purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.092" offset="3847711">This statute speaks in sweeping terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.467" offset="3857220">It prohibits any device, any scheme or any artifice of fraud used directly or indirectly in an offer or in a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.364" offset="3888880">No person reading that statute could think that he was free to pick up the telephone and call his broker and deceive his broker in the process of selling a security, and there is no question here but that the deceit that was practiced was willful and knowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.684" offset="3950111">The District Court found that and the Court of Appeals did not disagree about the clarity of the evidence showing fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.726" offset="3982294">Under these circumstances, we submit that the rule of lenity simply has no application.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.653" offset="4009984">For these reasons and those that we have expressed in our opening and reply briefs, we respectfully request that the decision of the court below be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.347" offset="4048750">And Mr. Chief Justice, I would ask your leave to reserve the balance of my time for reply.</text>

            <text syncTime="1005.118" offset="4123878">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.504" offset="4153344">When this case first came before this Court, the Government stated in its petition for certiorari that the decision of the Court of Appeals seriously impairs the ability of the United States and the Securities and Exchange Commission to enforce the securities laws in cases involving fraud practiced on the largest participants in the national securities markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.835" offset="4270686">They also stated at page 12 of their petition for certiorari that because 17 (a) (1) authorizes not only criminal prosecutions but also civil remedies, the effect of the decision here is to abolish one of the Government's most effective weapons against the most serious forms of securities fraud practiced on members of the brokerage industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.405" offset="4376952">And by the time we got through briefing this matter, on page 8 of the reply brief the Government says that the fact that respondent's conduct may have violated other provisions of the federal securities laws in addition to 17 (a) (1) is not material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.309" offset="4456573">And counsel stands up today and says that the conduct of this respondent violates 10 (a), violates 10 (b), violates the mail fraud statute, and I might say today violates Section 7 of the 1934 Exchange Act in connection with 7 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.473" offset="4561272">Now, having gotten into this Court --</text>

            <text syncTime="1124.133" offset="4599933">I think it makes this difference, Your Honor, as to whether or not this case would be before this Court here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.407" offset="4625011">This is the first time in over 45 years of the administration of the Securities Act of 1933 that anyone has ever been indicted in connection with what's called a short selling scheme, and we maintain that there are plenty of laws available in order to corral this kind of activity and that this respondent was not properly charged.</text>

            <text syncTime="1163.555" offset="4757608">Well, the only issue before us is whether he is properly charged under 17 (a) (1).</text>

            <text syncTime="1170.689" offset="4786134">Now that we are here, that is the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.547" offset="4801599">And I think in determining that issue we should remember that the Court of Appeals said that this respondent was not guilty of a violation of 17 (a) (1) because of the species of fraud practiced by the respondent, and I think that's a very important observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.117" offset="4899819">What is the species of fraud practiced by the respondent?</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.509" offset="4925419">They say it is short sell, and they say it is defrauding the broker in that the respondent lied to him and misrepresented that he had stock to sell that he didn't then own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.056" offset="4979545">But the species of fraud really is the obtaining of illegal credit which when you're dealing with securities on the national securities exchanges is regulated by Section 7 of the Exchange Act of 1934.</text>

            <text syncTime="1238.935" offset="5059062">Well, Mr. Walters, why does it make any difference which “species of fraud,” as you put it, he engaged in when 17 (a) (1) makes criminal the employment of any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud?</text>

            <text syncTime="1254.791" offset="5122487">It is our contention that the 1933 Act was directed towards the purchaser of securities, that it dealt with the offer or the sale of securities to the purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.317" offset="5188629">It dealt with the distribution of securities in the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.944" offset="5219140">Whereas, the 1934 Securities Act dealt with the transactional situations in the marketplace, what was happening on the stock exchanges?</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.967" offset="5275251">And as some of the debate in the legislative history of the 1933 Act indicates, there was some disappointment on the part of some of the members of the House of Representatives that the 1933 Act did not outlaw transactional things such as short selling, selling against the box, washed sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.280" offset="5380472">But they stated that they realized you couldn't do it all in one act, therefore the 1934 Act took care of transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.517" offset="5417462">Now, what did the 1934 Act do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.661" offset="5426030">It did not outlaw short selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.280" offset="5444524">As one of the witnesses testified in this case, short selling is a common practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.198" offset="5488201">Often the exchange, in dealing with the third market securities, the same securities that are traded on the exchange, if they are traded off of the exchange short selling is commonly done, it is a part of business.</text>

            <text syncTime="1424.928" offset="5803133">And I direct this Court's attention to the fact that we are dealing with a transaction that involves the exchange mechanism, that involves the very thing that the 1934 Act was passed to regulate, whereas the 1933 Act provisions were there for the purposes of regulating the distribution of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.611" offset="5921834">Now, the -- as the facts indicate, not one investor in any way was injured as a result of the transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.751" offset="5970422">The illegal extension of credit was in effect what the court found to be the specie of fraud, as they stated that the respondent took a free ride on the broker's money or credit and in so doing violated the 1934 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.979" offset="6047326">So consequently, in dealing with the particular problem that we have here, I believe that the Court of Appeals correctly analyzed what species of fraud was that's involved in this particular case, and in addition in looking at the 1933 Act on the one hand and the 1934 Act on the other, recognized the charge that should have been placed against this respondent did not fall under 17 (a) but rather fell under the 1934 Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.018" offset="6583463">I maintain that under the 1933 Act that the deceit on the purchaser should be read into subdivision (1) and subdivision (2) and subdivision (3) and I point out that if you look at Section 12 and you look at Section 11 of the 1933 Act, you will find it is only the purchaser that has standing to bring a cause of action for fraud, deception or anything in violation of the 1993 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.059" offset="6715643">And I believe that that is an indicator that that should be carried forth in 17 (a) provision, that it is really the fraud on the purchaser in connection with a sale that is governed by this particular section, and we have argued that in our brief, that you should re-read into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.709" offset="6782203">Now, counsel has made the observation that the basis for the 17 -- Section 17 (a) was the mail fraud statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.241" offset="6824312">According to the research we have done, it was a combination of the mail fraud statute and the Martin Act of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.859" offset="6862764">The Martin Act was the blue sky act that New York State had adopted and the interpretations of the Martin Act by its Supreme Court limited violations to purchasers only, and when the 1933 Act was written and finally adopted, it was a combination of mail fraud and the Martin Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.023" offset="6971434">And I still say that is in keeping, that 17 (a) is still limited to frauds and violations insofar as they direct its conduct towards the purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.616" offset="7029844">And the conduct that the respondent here was involved in was not directed to the purchaser at all, it was directed in fact to the broker by way of obtaining illegal credit in violation of law, and that law was the 1934 Act and so if there was a violation that is where this man should have been charged.</text>

            <text syncTime="1789.304" offset="7260557">Now, before closing I would like to point out to the Court a statement made by the Government in its reply brief as an effort to overcome the fact that there was an offer made which the court found to be in violation of the law, and I refer the Court to page 3 of the Government's reply brief in its footnote number 3, in which the Government does not agree with the statement that we made on page 18, footnote 31 of our brief, in which we made the observation that the District Court found only fraud in the sale of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.892" offset="7514990">The Court of Appeals found fraud in neither offer nor sale, and offer and sale, of course, are distinct acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.254" offset="7548426">Then the Government in its reply brief comes back and says that we are mistaken because of the fact that the District Court specifically found that as to each count of the indictment the defendant acted as charged, and what I want to point out is that the findings of the trial court which appear on page 28 of the petition for writ of certiorari, says, as to each count of the indictment, the court finds that the defendant acted as charged in the count willfully and knowingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.712" offset="7742255">And I say that that is not a correct characterization by the Government, the court didn't find that the respondent was found guilty of everything as charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.455" offset="7789171">What the trial court said was that insofar as the indictment said that what he did was willful and knowingly, I find that to be correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.850" offset="7834728">And I think that is a far statement from saying that this respondent was found guilty of anything at all in connection with the offering of securities by the trial court, and, of course, we are here on the facts of this particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1976.789" offset="8010480">The statutory definition of an offer is simply an attempt to dispose of a security for value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.019" offset="8035453">The evidence here showed that there was an attempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.523" offset="8045484">That was the only purpose of calling the broker and telling him to sell the shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.238" offset="8064293">We think that this finding of the District Court is sufficient to establish that there was fraud used in an offer as well as a sale.</text>
