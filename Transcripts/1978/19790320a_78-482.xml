            <label>Mr. Cletus B. Hanley</label>
            <text syncTime="12.110" offset="152827">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.368" offset="173829">This is a case in which on February 9, 1978, a shooting occurred in the City of St. Albans, West Virginia, that’s about 12 miles from Charleston, the capital city and it’s in a metropolitan area there at West Virginia, (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="34.882" offset="243942">It was about 250,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.110" offset="256794">And a 14-year-old boy was apprehended and taken into custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.691" offset="291171">Later on that day, a juvenile hearing was held and he was declared a delinquent under our West Virginia law.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.657" offset="327011">It’s against the statute of West Virginia for a newspaper to print the name of a juvenile who was under arrest or pending a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.367" offset="385839">On the next day, on February 10th, the Charleston Gazette, a statewide newspaper in West Virginia published the name of the juvenile on the front page along with a picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.453" offset="450205">And also, an editorial made comment that they were deliberately doing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.940" offset="488135">They were the Gazette, wait a minute, then the Daily Mail, an afternoon newspaper, published the name that afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.383" offset="529930">These -- both of these newspapers along with the editors and reporters were indicted by a Kanawha County Grand Jury later on in the month.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.515" offset="578414">Before trial could be held, the newspapers sought provision in the Supreme Court of West Virginia and a rule was issued on both newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.459" offset="626270">Separate rules were issued on both newspapers putting the case before our Supreme Court for argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.828" offset="659707">The cases were then consolidated for arguments and I want to point out to the Court mainly today that these cases, the fact situations are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.574" offset="718744">In the Gazette case, they alleged in their petition that it was already common knowledge when they printed this juvenile’s name.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.435" offset="778094">In the answer of the state, it was denied that this was.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.567" offset="818636">The Gazette newspaper then demurred to the answer so for all practical purposes, they were then saying for the purpose of this case, it was not common knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.638" offset="866910">And the information was not obtained from any other source from hearing or from assistant prosecuting attorney which I noted in the brief, it now says that it’s in prosecuting attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.457" offset="930231">So the bare issue then is whether a newspaper may print the name of a juvenile when they sought the information and obtained it on their own.</text>

            <text syncTime="228.123" offset="1016853">However, the -- I want to point that out because of the past case law of this Court indicating where the information is obtained by court records as in the Cox case where the information is obtained at a public hearing the Nebraska case or when the information is obtained in a closed hearing where the court allowed the press in.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.995" offset="1140360">That one makes a big distinction so what I’m saying to the Court, this is a case now of first impression and it’s not a case of a fitting in with the Cox or Nebraska or the Oklahoma case.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.416" offset="1202009">If the case fits in for anything, it fits in with the Virgin Island case.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.791" offset="1231579">Of course that’s our contention this is the reasoning in the (Inaudible) case should be adopted by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.893" offset="1359997">We are saying, what I was trying to say is that the information was not obtained in a court hearing or court record as in the Cox, Nebraska, or Oklahoma cases.</text>
