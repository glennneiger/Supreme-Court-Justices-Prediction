            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="7.777" offset="31033">This case is here on appeal for the New York Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.626" offset="46498">At issue is the constitutionality of New York adoption statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.733" offset="66873">Under this statute, a child may be adopted only if both of its parents consent with the adoption.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.034" offset="96131">An exemption is made, however, with respect to children voluntarily whereby only the consent of the mother is required when an illegitimate child is up for adoption.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.564" offset="142211">Regardless of the circumstances, is that the father has no comparable rights under New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.297" offset="169169">Thus, a categorical distinction is made in this respect between fathers and mothers of illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.327" offset="205218">The parties in this case, the appellant, Caban, and appellee, Mohammed, are the parents of two children born while they were living together for several years.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.068" offset="252238">Over those years, they lived together as a family and appellant contributed to the support of the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.474" offset="281809">After the couple separated, the children continued to see their father regularly although they live with their mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.249" offset="312947">The mother married another man.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.906" offset="323605">She and her new husband then sought to adopt the two illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.440" offset="345757">The natural father's objection to the adoption was rejected by the New York courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.918" offset="367595">His claim that the statute deprived him of Equal Protection of the laws also was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.422" offset="393613">In an opinion filed today with the clerk, we hold that the New York statute is in invalid under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.165" offset="432588">At this with respect to children as old as appellants and where an established relationship exists, the New York statute bears no substantial relation to any important state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.118" offset="492460">Accordingly we reversed the Court of Appeals of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.997" offset="507925">Mr. Justice Stewart has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.240" offset="520882">Mr. Justice Stevens also has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Rehnquist have joined.</text>
