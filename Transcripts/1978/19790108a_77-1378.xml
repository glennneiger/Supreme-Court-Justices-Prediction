            <text syncTime="15.699" offset="166118">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.968" offset="179284">The precise issue to be decided in this case is whether the existence of situs through the fiction of an assumed average presence, can be relied upon by appellees so as to tax foreign containers which are used exclusively in foreign commerce, are continuously in transit, and which the trial court found had their home port in Japan, so as to justify a conclusion of continuous presence within appellee's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.469" offset="317210">Such presence is necessary in order to permit the subjection of containers to an apportioned ad valorem California property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.075" offset="351692">Such tax, it is noted, would be in addition to full ad valorem property taxes, which have been levied upon the containers at their home port in Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.791" offset="390562">Unless the decision of the California Supreme Court is reversed, this case undoubtedly will have profound and adverse impacts upon the foreign trade relations of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.400" offset="436955">Indeed the Court in requesting the Solicitor General to express his views on the case has recognized the important foreign policy and foreign relations questions triggered by California’s unilateral rejection of the home port doctrine in the case of foreign owned instrumentalities used exclusively in foreign commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="115.626" offset="565896">I believe that the Customs Convention is another indication of the federal interest in this area and that the home port doctrine was a means enunciated by this Court more than a 130 years ago in order to deal with the treatment of the taxation of foreign-owned instrumentalities that the Customs Convention is one of numerous areas of federal expression of its concern in this area.</text>

            <text syncTime="166.863" offset="770800">What we are arguing is that there are long established customs among the trading nations of the world which have been recognized by this Court in its adoption of the Hays versus Pacific Mail Shipping Company case, this was a basic Commerce Clause rule and that there are reliance interests of foreign governments on this long accepted policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.484" offset="889292">They have based their trade relations with the United States in connection with the international carriage of goods and passengers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1914.359" offset="7760854">Concern has been expressed so far on the question whether this Court has ever applied the home port doctrine in the international context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.428" offset="7797112">Of course every time the Court has distinguished Hays it is done so with express recognition that the rule may be different for international transport and in the first case that distinguished Hays, the Pullman Palace Car Company case, the Court expressly stated that the rule with regard to instruments for intercommunication with other nations may require national treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.039" offset="7891571">But at least since this Court's decision in Hays and until the imposition of the tax by appellees in this case, the consistent domestic practice of the United States has been to exempt foreign-owned and domiciled instruments of foreign commerce from local property taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.954" offset="7959176">Our domestic practice in this regard is confirmed to the international custom that affords an immunity from local property taxation to other nations' instruments of world commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="2114.269" offset="8560410">Then immunity conferred by the international custom is not simply a commercial favor granted by nations to foreign co-operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.966" offset="8591235">Instead it is based on a recognition of the special interest that each nation posses in the development and utilization of its instruments for world trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.447" offset="8629164">And is in this sense an expression of difference and mutual accommodation among commercial nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.911" offset="8654973">The tax imposed by appellees in this case in the similar tax on foreign aircraft that the state has proposed to asses is a direct departure from the excepted international practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.952" offset="8699173">Appellees claim that because the tax is an apportion tax it does not unconstitutionally burden commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.191" offset="8728116">But this argument we submit is made with an parochial and unrealistic framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.785" offset="8750477">It is true that is recently as the Washington Stevedoring case, this Court has stated that when a tax on commerce within the United States is apportioned among the states, multiple burdens on such commerce “logically cannot occur.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.284" offset="8808469">But the logic of that conclusion depends on the fact that in cases involving domestic or interstate commerce such as the Standard Oil and the Braniff cases, this Court can require the state of domicile as well as the non-domiciliary state to apportion the tax with the result that the property in aggregate is subject to only one tax on its full value.</text>

            <text syncTime="2245.935" offset="9087143">The international custom that exempts these instruments from local property taxation also recognizes as this Court recognized in Hays that the nation of domicile may impose a full tax on the value of its instruments of foreign trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.450" offset="9145135">The practical, logical consequence of appellees' unilateral imposition of its tax in conflict with the international practice is to inflict a multiple tax burden on foreign domiciled instruments of commerce and specially disadvantage this commerce because of its origin.</text>

            <text syncTime="3269.668" offset="13181994">But Mr. Chief justice when we arrive at the particular point in question I think we have all of those benefits and protections which we have logically cited in our brief and it is that the appellant's burden to dispute that and to reject the fact that the services to which the tax is put does not apply to them and I think we have logically shown that they do apply to them that fire and police protection applies to them, that the flood control applies to them, that all of the other services which aid the appellants in coming into our taxing jurisdiction as an enterprise and earning profit should be recouped by the local government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.349" offset="13332773">Once you get beyond that point and we look into the treaties itself to determine whether or not the federal government has indeed enacted a particular point in order to disturb that relationship, I think it is wise to look at the federal, the friendship commerce and navigation treaties, and the start of that inquiry of course is Article 22 paragraph 4 where a national treatment is defined differently for states and territories than it is for the United States itself and by treaty national treatment does not say no less than treatment you will give other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.353" offset="13476760">It says that national treatment equals the same treatment you give enterprises from other states and relating that national treatment to the articles which are key in this particular case we run up against the import export provision in Article 14, paragraph 5 which says you will give national treatment in all respects to import and export.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.333" offset="13592743">In Article 19, paragraph 3 you will give national treatment and equal treatment to vessels coming into your territory and in Article 16, paragraph 1 you will give national treatment with regard to internal taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.081" offset="13659721">I believe that the friendship commerce and navigation treaties thereby show that the states that the federal government even if we admit the federal power to exist to exempt from the state taxation without taking the responsibility for the services provided even if we say that power exists in the federal government we have problem with regard to the FCN treaties and one would believe that in light of the apportionment statements in the FCN treaties, in light of the particular statements with regard to the import export and vessels and internal taxes that some demonstrable showing with regard to the container convention would be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.538" offset="13833488">If the container convention is cited as apparent overruling, the FCN treaties that some positive showing and as a matter of fact the Secretary's authority under 19 U.S.C. 1322 (a) sheds even additional light beyond that and that is that the secretary has the authority with regard to all the instrumentalities of commerce which come from foreign countries to say that they will be exempt from the ordinary customs laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.241" offset="13972355">Now, if we say that this non-discriminatory uniform property tax is indeed a customs law then I think we say that practically every general tax in the country is a customs law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.589" offset="14025749">I find no illusion to property taxes in 19 U.S.C. whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.085" offset="14039751">I find no illusion to property taxes in the Customs Convention or the Container Convention, which I believe ought to be present, if we are going to have such an impact which was acknowledged in the FCN treaties to be the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.432" offset="14097115">We would have something explicit in the Container Convention and to simply say that property is taxed by reason of importation, simply because it comes into the taxing jurisdiction, is to say that every tax on very piece of foreign property is immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.766" offset="14166392">Now, the idea is that in essence what the appellants are really -- the logic of the appellant's position is that because there is a danger of multiple taxation we should not tax this property, which has exactly the same kind of benefits and burden relationship as any other property continuously existing in the taxing jurisdiction that is not shown to be wrong by the appellants of the United States or anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.403" offset="14272972">The United States relies on a custom of international law and they prove half of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.813" offset="14294601">They say that some countries do not tax our property going into their jurisdiction, but they do not prove the other half.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.582" offset="14321664">They do not say that they have personal property tax structure in their country and therefore they made some kind of exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.026" offset="14347473">They do not say that they do not recoup these matters by other kinds of fees or taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.769" offset="14374431">They simply say that when it gets down to personal property taxes, most of the countries don't impose them and then they fight a few exceptions and that is the 30-day rule, the 90-day rule in Afghanistan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.704" offset="14426154">One would therefore that since we have a 30-day rule on the customs laws of other countries that therefore California could tax as the containers were here over 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.724" offset="14474219">Now, we do have a question mark in the factual stipulation, the average is 3 weeks no less than 6 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.198" offset="14500133">It is quite possible that many of those containers over here over 30 days, we don't know, but the very idea is that if they are then California would be going along reciprocity with those nations who imposed -- which impose a 30-day rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="4572.329" offset="18392691">When the container comes in here, the fee in the port is imposed on the vessel whether it has containers or not.</text>
