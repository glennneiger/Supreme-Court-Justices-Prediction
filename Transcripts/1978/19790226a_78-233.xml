            <text syncTime="75.466" offset="406215">My name is Thomas R. Kiley.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.227" offset="413320">I’m the first Assistant Attorney General at the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.219" offset="429307">With me at counsel table A is Attorney General Francis X. Bellotti.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.805" offset="447592">We appear today in defense of the Commonwealth’s veterans preference statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.937" offset="464102">The statute which was quantified when challenged is Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 31, Section 23 and which is set forth in the form which it existed at that time at page 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.049" offset="516556">In the essence, it is a positional veteran’s preference statute, which places veterans who qualify for civil service jobs by passing examinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.637" offset="554904">At the top of civil service lists of those eligible for appointment to jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.071" offset="580712">This positional preference statute is challenged by Helen B. Feeney, a non-veteran female who alleges that the application of the statute denies her and people of gender, equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.423" offset="638077">The thrust of her complaint is that few women are veterans and that application of the veteran’s preference naturally excludes women from civil service jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.187" offset="685098">The case comes to this court on appeal from a divided three judge panel in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.685" offset="719161">That court first decided this case in March of 1976 invalidating the state statute largely on the basis of its impact on women.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.583" offset="758763">On our original appeal, you remanded the cause to the District Court for reconsideration in light of Washington and Davis.</text>

            <text syncTime="203.388" offset="917901">The three judge panel reconsidered this case on the original record and adhered to its original ruling, essentially agreeing with Mrs. Feeney’s basic contention that the veterans preference statute is applied in Massachusetts invidiously discriminates against women in violation of Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.943" offset="992193">We obliviously disagree with that conclusion, but we do not disagree with everything that the District Court had to say in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.009" offset="1020406">In the areas of agreement are important to emphasis of the outset of the argument because they serve to narrow our focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.376" offset="1049872">First, nobody seems to contend that the concept of a civil service hiring preference for veterans is itself unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.016" offset="1084458">Each of the judges who considered this case, the parties before this court and amicus curii, all seem to staff from the premise the veteran’s hiring preferences are constitutional and that they are further important societal objectives.</text>

            <text syncTime="312.426" offset="1354146">I think, I frankly Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think I have to take both of their opinions in both of the cases because of the way this particular case is, happens to come before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.153" offset="1405032">To the extent that the disagreement on the form of the particular statute maybe appropriately framed in the judicial as opposed to legislative form, its resolution before this court may well turn on the operation of the Massachusetts Civil Service System and the facts of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.897" offset="1479952">If I accomplish nothing else today I hope to focus the court’s attention on the operation of the statute and on the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.338" offset="1513702">The second statement of the District Court’s opinions with which we wholeheartedly concur, is the conclusion of the Massachusetts Veterans Preference was not enacted for the purpose of disqualifying women from receiving civil service position and it’s concession that the State’s prime objective of aiding those who served our country in time of war is rational and legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.170" offset="1609101">The third point on which we agree with the lower court is that this case is not a vehicle for an evaluation of the constitutionality of Federal investment policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.833" offset="1651733">Policies which the plaintiff Mrs. Feeney’s presumes amount to a (Inaudible) this system of sex discrimination in Federal military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.378" offset="1689872">If the plaintiff or a class of women want to challenge the Federal investment policies, let them do so directly and not collaterally and let the Federal Government have the opportunity to defend its own statutes and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.511" offset="1750476">We consent to you today not with the Federal policies themselves, it’s solely with the question of the validity of the Massachusetts Veterans Preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.194" offset="1785166">And the application and the answer to the question turns lastly according to the plaintiffs on the application, operational effects of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.361" offset="1825813">Before any analysis of this case must begin with an understanding of the Massachusetts Civil Service System.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.192" offset="1857160">To begin with all State jobs are not covered by that system, 40% of the jobs many of them upper level, higher paying policy making positions, the kind of positions this Court discussed in Elrod v. Burns are not covered by the Civil Service System at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.552" offset="1926646">60% of the jobs are and they fall entirely into two categories of jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.584" offset="1950783">They are classified labor service and classified official service and Mrs. Feeney’s challenge in this case close goes only to or at least her evidence in this case was only to the official classified service, one of the two components.</text>

            <text syncTime="703.261" offset="2917418">My reference, I think Mr. Chief Justice is to the age of individuals now and the preference as it operates now, the class of non-eligibles for the veterans preference includes approximately a million males.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.927" offset="2984082">The class of preference eligibles includes about 800,000 males and about 16,000 females.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.951" offset="3024206">After passing an examination, one waits for a requisition to come from a particular appointing authority and while there are various methods of certification that the personnel administrator uses, they all share one prime characteristic and that is -- that he certifies more names than there are positions to be filled.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.161" offset="3116993">Moreover, at this stage of the process at least now in Massachusetts, the personnel administrator may certify a number of minority or women equal to the number of individuals who would be certified under the normal process if he first makes a determination that there has been discrimination against those people on the basis of race, sex, or national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.600" offset="3218766">The final step in the appointment process is the actual hiring and is made by an appointing authority not by the personnel administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.645" offset="3250949">It’s important to emphasize that the appointing authority need not appoint those who appear at the top of the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.819" offset="3279684">Certification guarantee is consideration, but not appointment, and an appointing authority is free to reach past the individual who appears at the top of the list and hire somebody who appears beneath him or her.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.015" offset="3332451">Thus a veteran, who is looking at the Civil Service System from the outside faces two significant barriers to appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.863" offset="3363798">First, he has to pass the Civil Service Examination and then even if he gets to the top of the list he may not be hired by particular appointing authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.962" offset="3404236">It’s that system that Helen Feeney challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.122" offset="3416879">As I stated earlier she is not a veteran and she never made application to serve in the military although in World War II she was in age when her peers -- her contemporaries in terms of age were of an age when they were either volunteering a faced conscription.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.279" offset="3485529">In fact, Helen Feeney’s affidavit tells us the reason that she did not enter the service although she inquired as to admission practices is that her mother didn’t think that the reputation of women seek in the military at the time was good.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.017" offset="3544461">Helen Feeney turned 21 in 1943, she chose not to apply for the military thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.788" offset="3571524">Helen Feeney has an expansive employment record, spending 28 years from 1948 to 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.837" offset="3603707">The early years of that service were all private sector jobs until 1963 she went exclusively in the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.530" offset="3642472">In 1962, she took and passed her first open competitive Civil Service Examination, it’s for a clerical position.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.695" offset="3675178">And in 1963, she was appointed to the clerical position in the Massachusetts Civil Defense Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.452" offset="3702241">She held that clerical position for approximately four years at which time she took and passed an open promotional examination and became the agency’s Federal Funds and Personnel Coordinator.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.741" offset="3755321">She remained in that position for approximately eight years until a point within 53 days of the date she passed, she filed at this particular action, on that date the civil defense agency was effectively abolished in Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.655" offset="3830972">In addition to the two open competitive examinations, which she took regarding the Civil Defense Agency, Helen Feeney took and passed approximately seven open examinations in the civil service system in the ten years that preceded this compliant.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.777" offset="3899517">For one reason or another, she was never appointed to any of the positions for which she applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.490" offset="3922401">But she premises her case, she predicates the compliant largely on two particular positions which she applied for and did not obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.032" offset="3960539">Those two positions are the Head Administrative Assistant at the Solomon Mental Health Centre, exhibit two of the appendix pertains to that slot and to the positions of Administrative Assistant in the mental health system generally, in exhibit 6 in the appendix pertains to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.191" offset="4033160">I will return to these two positions later in my argument and will demonstrate that in each instance, any injury that Helen Feeney suffered by virtue of the application of veterans preference was some -- an inquiry that she shared in common with male non-veterans and that she would have suffered the same kind of injury whatever the form of veterans preference had been applied by that I mean it for 5 and 10 point preference model on the Federal system had been in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.211" offset="4145277">But for this court the plaintiff has recast the issue if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.350" offset="4165757">If you now ask the question whether a preference, which excludes women from competitive civil service positions by granting them an absolute preference violates the 14th amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.623" offset="4214868">Her argument makes it clear that she uses the word competitive in this context an essence that is was used to apply to upper level, higher paying positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.105" offset="4252797">There are two other statements in this formulation of the issue which I want to bring to the attention of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.354" offset="4273800">The first is the assertion that the preference afforded to veterans is absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.473" offset="4294280">As the earlier discussion of the Massachusetts system shows the preference is not absolutely in any sense of the word, veterans’ first have to pass qualifying examinations in order to benefit from the preference, and then maybe passed over for people ranking overall examination on the eligible lists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.944" offset="4372125">The second major statement which courses throughout the argument is that somehow Helen Feeney and women had been excluded; excluded from the Federal Military by the restrictive policies or excluded from the Massachusetts civil service system by application of veterans’ preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.102" offset="4440775">We submit the record in this case just as not support those broad conclusary statements, but the exclusory effects of this statute and of the restrictive Federal policies are more fiction than fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.898" offset="4500020">While veterans’ preference does benefit a class comprised more significantly of men than females, this adverse incidental impact is not enough to invalidate the statute in an equal protection challenge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1164.268" offset="4761454">Any methodology of equal protection analysis begins with a focus on the classification’s facial neutrality or the nature of the particular classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.081" offset="4800742">I do not intend to spend much time on the nature of this particular classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.238" offset="4821326">The statute in question clearly draws lines but it draws lines not on the basis of one’s gender but on a basis of objectively identifiable standards shared by individuals of both sexes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.853" offset="4875766">It restores competitive advantages on individuals regardless of their sex, who performed military service for the nation in time of war or who lost their husband and wife or son or daughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.469" offset="4926234">Those preferences eligible are objectively identifiable and they are objectively identifiable on the basis of characteristics which have nothing to do with gender.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.871" offset="4963850">The pool of eligibles and the pool of ineligibles are both comprised of significant numbers of people of both sexes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.128" offset="4992899">Under any categorization, this statute is facially neutral in terms of gender.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.944" offset="5020170">Now however uneven the application of the statute maybe, you never that obviate that facial neutrality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.754" offset="5051413">In Washington and Davis this Court articulated the principle that fits such facially neutral acts will not be invalidated solely on the basics of discriminatory impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.154" offset="5096970">In Arlington Heights you amplified on that holding and suggested a number of evidentiary factors which can illuminate the search for discriminatory intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.201" offset="5137199">One might have thought that the search in this particular case would have been very simple, after all the District Court, the first time around in this case stated that the Massachusetts Veterans’ Preference Statute was not enacted for the purpose of disqualifying women from receiving civil service appointments, but that the statute’s laudable purpose was not enough to insulate it from judicial invalidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.670" offset="5231031">This was because in the view of the District Court in the context of the Fourteenth Amendment it was the result and not the intent of the Act which mattered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.182" offset="5269170">In spite of the obvious differences between that holding and this court’s holdings and Washington and Davis and Arlington Heights, in this case the District Court did make a finding on remand of discriminatory intent, and I submit that the methodology that the Court used in doing so, cannot be condoned by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2009.909" offset="8143997">I’m Richard Ward and I represent the appellee Helen B. Feeney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.223" offset="8165313">Before turning to the difficult legal questions presented by this case, whether the adverse and disastrous impact upon women is in fact a deliberate discrimination sufficient so that this court should pay perhaps somewhat less deference to legislative judgments and then applying that standard to the question of whether or not the profit objectives are in fact substantially well served by Massachusetts choice of an absolute and permanent form of preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.750" offset="8275446">In light of the Commonwealth argument, it is important to understand exactly how this absolute preference system works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.141" offset="8304912">And to understand the significant systematic adverse impact on women and I don’t believe that the Commonwealth has carefully enough demonstrated or indeed admitted what that impact is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.681" offset="8355171">Most of brother Kiley’s argument rests on the fact that 42% of the persons over a 10-year period who obtain jobs were female.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.090" offset="8388712">That entirely misses the thrust of this action, the thrust of Helen Feeney’s case and indeed the basis of the court’s decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.547" offset="8422567">It also misses the admission of one of the prime defendants in the case the Director of Civil Service who in himself stating for the court exactly how the system worked especially in light of more recent changes in the Civil Service System whereby now they have what are called banded examinations for large numbers of positions, which large number of persons apply including large numbers of veterans who are principally male and large numbers of non-veterans for upper level or positions of significance who are principally female.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.987" offset="8568330">The Director of Civil Service in his testimony to the court below in the form of affidavit said that the system would work as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.867" offset="8599886">Women will continue to be employed primarily in the relatively low paying entry level clerical positions for which men traditionally do not apply, because It goes on to say however for the relatively high paying civil service positions such as programmers, planners, physiologists, administrative assistants, head administrative assistants et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.941" offset="8696121">The continued use of the Veterans Preference Statute will result in few if any female eligibles being considered and appointed to such positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.970" offset="8736246">That it is not a true demonstration of the effect upon women simply to point to the fact that 42% of all the persons hired were female, they are principally being hired as secretaries in the stereotypic jobs for which Massachusetts for 75 years has allowed women to obtain and allowed women to obtain in a more rigorous explicit sex distinctions in terms of the practice for 75 years of recruiting on the basis of sex for female jobs and male jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.965" offset="8860275">This is the thrust of the action and one must understand exactly how this veterans Preference system works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.356" offset="8885770">Although referred to below is an absolute preference and indeed this court is faced with the most extreme form of preference.</text>

            <text syncTime="3421.649" offset="13791044">No Your Honor, but the group is asserting, Mrs. Feeney happens to be member of a class of women and that’s the one that’s before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.683" offset="13819152">The handicap may well have an equally compelling argument under the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.419" offset="13842035">We deal here in fact with a case of a woman and we are looking at the standards applied by this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.702" offset="13867217">So to summarize basically we would feel that the wholesale incorporation of the military’s discrimination against women into the Public Employment System combined with the inevitability of the exclusionary effect virtually total.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.298" offset="13929597">Judge Campbell below said it constitutes a near blanket exclusion of women from the whole segment, a major segment of employment and it goes a long way towards making upper level Public Employment Massachusetts a male preserve, based on those two objective factors and the legislative history, we think clearly that this is at least a deliberate and purposeful discrimination against women and when we turn now to the question of what appropriate standard and we look to the standard that has been applied by this court in cases involving discrimination against women, we see that the court asked whether or not the classification serves an important governmental objective and whether or not the means chosen to substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.992" offset="14104409">And the one question that commonwealth could not answer when asked below and the one question that the commonwealth does not address itself to here is why have such an extreme form of preference and absolute and permanent one, one that lasts throughout a veteran’s lifetime and gives women virtually no chance, no matter how much ability is shown by an individual woman, does not give any of those women a chance for any of these upper level jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.928" offset="14220079">And that’s the question that we have to ask ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.697" offset="14227184">This is not a case of any preference simply a head start, but we are challenging this form, this extreme form of preference in which only a handful of states have a similar type of preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.650" offset="14266995">Most states of course having the more modest point preference and when you look at the profit goals offered by the state, we see that this particular form of preference does not well serve those goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.762" offset="14315478">First, we hear from the Attorney General from the Commonwealth in their brief, a lot of solicitude about readjustment back to civilian life, a lot of solicitude for the recently discharged veteran.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.094" offset="14360722">When we look at absolute and permanent form of preference and we ask what does it do for the recently discharged veteran?</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.528" offset="14386531">And again if we look at Exhibit seven the Administrative Assistance list, we see that it does very little for the discharged veterans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.020" offset="14420490">In fact of the 96 veterans on the two major lists, Exhibits seven and nine, the Administrative Assistants list and the other longer list, the counsel list, we find that 40 of the veterans were discharged in the 1940s, 20 in the 1950s, and 15 in the 1960s.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.073" offset="14484647">Only three of the top 25 on the eligible list for administrative assistance had been discharged within five years of service because it’s such an extreme preference, so broad, a permanent preference, it tends in fact to reward or to give benefit to the persons who are longest out of the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.447" offset="14558208">It also gives them additional benefit in terms if their rank relatively higher within that preference category than their most recently discharged veteran, and that the scores are also a function of how much training and experience you have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.683" offset="14615155">So the longer you're out of the service the higher score you’ll have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.631" offset="14630933">On the (Inaudible) list the average year of discharge was 1956, a full 19 years before the establishment of list.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.509" offset="14662384">So when we look at this extreme form of preference we see that it does not really well serve the veteran most in need of some readjustment assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.996" offset="14700419">And as the Commonwealth has pointed out it’s also the fact that a lot of veterans can’t pass the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.373" offset="14737930">These are the persons logically are most in need of some readjustments.</text>

            <text syncTime="3693.226" offset="14877320">There is certainly no evidence whatsoever that the profit goal of encouraging enlistment if that’s particularly important interest to a state as served at all, no factual rationale.</text>

            <text syncTime="3716.371" offset="14969898">For example the state couldn’t really say that only veterans could practice law in this Commonwealth of Massachusetts or only the children are veterans, there has to be some limit and we look --</text>
