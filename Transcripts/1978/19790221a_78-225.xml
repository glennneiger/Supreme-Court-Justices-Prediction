            <text syncTime="52.846" offset="211383">This is an appeal from a judgment of three-judge District Court, holding unconstitutional in its entirety, Arizona’s Agricultural Employment Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.327" offset="257254">The invalidated statute is patterned after the National Labor Relations Act, that is it guarantees employee organizational rights, provides for collective bargaining, secret ballot, election process.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.466" offset="309812">It prohibits 20 separate unfair labor practices, establishes an agriculture labor relations board, gives that board authority to adopt rules and regulations and generally to enforce and implement the policies of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.311" offset="369162">At the time that this case went to trial, the parties stipulated to 20 cases in which the Act had been applied in some way.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.000" offset="407928">Eight of those involved secondary boycotts.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.888" offset="423497">Six were election proceeding and six were proceeding against employers because of unfair labor practices, employer unfair labor practices as defined by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.336" offset="469264">The focus at the trial was not on these instances of enforcement for reasons that I'll develop in just about two minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.047" offset="504163">Rather the great bulk of the evidence at the trial concentrated on expert opinion concerning how the Act would probably be interpreted and how it would probably operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.639" offset="558498">The principle issue at the trial was how the election provisions would be applied and how long it will take to hold an election under the Act in the view of the --</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="165.766" offset="662988">Precisely Mr. Chief Justice it was built on two hypothesize, one was factual and one was legal, neither of which we contend was within the preview of District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.949" offset="707709">Armed with that kind of a record, the court specifically found constitutionally defective, five specific provisions of the Act, parts of four sections out of some 16 of the Act consists of, including one out of 20 unfair labor practices and from this determination that five provisions were unconstitutional, the District Court invalidated, struck down the entire statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.831" offset="815229">The points of disagreement between the parties are in this case are far more numerous than this Court is accustomed to dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.243" offset="848875">Indeed, there isn't even an agreement between the parties as to what the number of questions presented before this Court is, but careful analysis of those briefs reveals that there are at least six propositions advanced by the appellants concerning which the appellees have either not joined issue at all or the joinder if attempted hasn't really meshed, so that the point is effectively undisputed and fortunately those six propositions undisputed and undisputable are dispositive of the case before this Court, as a consequence I believe that the most helpful way that I can use my scarce oral argument time of this afternoon is – yes?</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>

            <text syncTime="265.698" offset="1062766">Well, I know that Mr. Justice White and I realize no constitutional obligation, take all my time, I appreciate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.205" offset="1088784">But when you are dealing somewhere between seven and ten questions presented and each of the ten raises many sub issues, there is some problem of allocation, no matter how one attempts to be prompt, which I assure you I will do.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.018" offset="1144059">So I'd like concentrate on these six propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.004" offset="1155971">The first two concern whether this dispute really amounts to a case or controversy at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.242" offset="1188885">The appellees lay great stress on the enforcement stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.328" offset="1205290">There are 20 instances in which the Act has been enforced, but the fact that is not disputed is that of the five provisions held unconstitutional by the District Court, namely the sections dealing with elections, untruthful publicity, binding arbitration, free access to employer facilities, and the provisions making violations of misdemeanor, not one, not a single one has ever been applied to any of these plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.845" offset="1319288">There is, indeed the only section that's ever been applied to anyone of those five is the election provision and that's not to these plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.421" offset="1349590">Now there is an attempt by the appellees as to one of these provisions, sub section 8 of the Unfair Labor Practices, the one that prohibits untruthful publicity to join issue but they don't really do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.730" offset="1406851">The fact of the matter is that in one case only, case number two, the Safeway case, there was an allegation in the complaint of a violation of sub section 8, but the Superior Court, the Trial Court made a preliminary determination, a threshold determination that the union's conduct in that case was a sufficient compliance with sub section 8 and as a consequence it has never been applied and we are left with this fact that of all of those 20 instances not one has ever been applied to these plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.832" offset="1531298">The second point of no real dispute is this and it concerns the law dealing with this kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.820" offset="1571213">I know of no case and in the six years of this litigation our opponents have not been able to suggest any in which this Court has approved the consideration in its entirety of a comprehensive regulatory statute whose provisions raise a variety of separate constitutional questions in advance of and in the absence of the application to those provisions to particular individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.508" offset="1697959">Supposing the election procedure is so cumbersome and the timing is so bad that they can never have an election, could they ever challenge it?</text>
            <text syncTime="434.539" offset="1738083">Because the whole hypothesis on which their argument is built is that they can never get an election in any event and I think your argument is as well that's just too bad, we got an unconstitutional statute here that can never be challenged?</text>

            <text syncTime="452.809" offset="1811226">But even so I would feel much more comfortable if at least they had tried to hold an election and there had been some demonstration some facts on the record that in fact it takes too long to hold an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.667" offset="1858664">Here there is simply an assumption that it takes too long, an assumption that is entirely unfounded.</text>

            <text syncTime="469.206" offset="1876741">That goes to the merits of whether they are right or not, but for purposes of standing in case or controversy, don't we have to assume that there is merit to their argument?</text>

            <text syncTime="476.528" offset="1906103">Yes, we certainly do, but my point I think is nevertheless valid, that at the very least with regard to case or controversy as it applies to elections, that you have to at least have tried and at least to have shown that in fact there is some -- on the merits the election issue depends on delay.</text>

            <text syncTime="505.988" offset="2023863">Of course not and the only -- in the final analysis we point out in brief the only thing that they are saying is that whereas before Arizona had no election, now it has an election process, but what they are really complaining about is it Arizona did not go far enough and provide enough protection for associational interests as perceived by the appellees and there is this case from the Eastern District of Virginia that says very clearly, that there is no obligation on any state to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="626.177" offset="2504620">Each of them consists of organizational guarantees, collective bargaining guarantees, prohibition of unfair labor practices, the establishment of an administrative agency with power to implement the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="641.880" offset="2567419">It is unthinkable that this Court would have permitted any court, Federal or State to start at the beginning of the National Labor Relations Act, wade through all of its probations, declare five parts unconstitutional when none of them had been enforced as to any of the plaintiffs and then based on that kind of determination, hold the whole statute unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.200" offset="2664699">Now there are statements coming out of this Court condemning that kind of practice, reaching all the way back from Justice Holmes day to the opinion says February 20th, but I was cautioned by the Chief Justice that it really should say February 21st.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.774" offset="2727079">Mr. Justice Powell's opinion for the Court this morning in Friedman versus Rogers, it was the same problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.413" offset="2753620">These people who were the commercial optometrists said we fear that we can't get a fair hearing before a body that is composed substantially of the non-commercial optometrists and Justice Powell acknowledged that they were entitled under the Gibson and Wall cases to a fair hearing, but then the opinion goes on to say in both Gibson and Wall however disciplinary proceedings had been instituted against the plaintiff's and the courts were able to examine in a particular context the possibility that the members of the regulatory board might have personal interest that precluded a fair and impartial hearing of the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.988" offset="2903876">In contrast, Rogers challenged to the fairness of the board, does not arise from any disciplinary proceeding against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.119" offset="2932402">In a word, election cases -- the constitutionality of the election probations ought to be decided in election case.</text>

            <text syncTime="836.371" offset="3345450">This is another of those instances in which there is a very close relationship between the merits and case or controversy, but I do think that you need that, do more than just make the formal application.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.058" offset="3388186">I think you'd need to show that the factual predicate of the constitutional issue that you are raising is in fact there otherwise you are bringing the Federal machinery into play when it may not make a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.545" offset="3434162">That of course is also closely relates to the abstention question.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.461" offset="3445760">I'd like to turn now to a closely related issue which is the severability question and here the dispositive reality is that that have not been disputed are two.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.704" offset="3486720">The first is that the test for severability as it has been announced in this Court is the Champlin test that is cited in page 77 of our brief unless it is evident that the legislature would not have enacted those provisions wherein its power independently that which is not, the invalid part maybe dropped if what is left is fully operative as a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.872" offset="3587448">As I read the modern cases dealing with severability, including most importantly Tilton and Jackson that is the leading statement of the law of severability coming from this Court at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.847" offset="3635304">That case is not acknowledged.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.710" offset="3642828">It's not even cited by our opponents and I submit that the reason is a recognition that, that test cannot be satisfied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.628" offset="3686504">Applying that test it is nothing short of absurd to say that Arizona's judgments for example that there should be collective bargaining for Arizona, for agricultural labor or that the union should not be permitted to picket the homes of agricultural workers or find one of its members because it gives testimony before the board or that an employer should not be permitted to dominate a union or contribute financial support or discriminate against an employee because of union activities and many others in any way depend on whether there's been an election or whether compulsory arbitration is constitutional or whether there is access to employer facilities. Regardless of how you come out on those five issues, the Arizona legislature has concluded that Arizona needs an Agricultural Labor Relations Board and that that board needs the authority to prohibit 19 out of 20 un-invalidated, unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.521" offset="3941982">The magnitude of the district court's error is illustrated by the fact that Arizona is now prevented from controlling unfair labor practices that non even Appellees contended were unconstitutional including irony of all ironies, employer unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.875" offset="4015438">Look at the enforcement stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.096" offset="4024320">Just about a third of those cases were cases in which the employer had discriminated against his employees because of their union activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.147" offset="4072490">My client, the State of Arizona has a legitimate interest in preventing that kind of employer conduct and in those instances where there has been employer retaliation in bringing into play on the employee side of the conflict the way to the state to prevent that kind of employer conduct and the same in the event that the union has taken improper action against its own members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.788" offset="4203102">We come now to the most important subject of question and that is the constitutionality of Section 1389 dealing with elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.401" offset="4237584">The district court made it very clear that this was its pivotal holding, the most important subject of holding and this is one of the provisions that was invalidated on the basis of the “evidence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.555" offset="4282201">But the evidence that the court found relevant was not evidence developed on in any actual case or controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.424" offset="4309682">As the Chief Justice pointed out it was based on a twin hypothesis how the Act would work and how it would be interpreted and it was that hypothetical, not any of the such election cases that have actually been held, it was that hypothetical that was held unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.453" offset="4377809">Now even aside from the obvious case or controversy problems, with that kind of approach what substantively was wrong with this election procedure and the thing that was wrong with it is that in some instances it might be impossible, the district court hypothesized, to hold an election during the employment peak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.019" offset="4467984">Now there is no dispute that the problem of how you solve elections during an employment peak is an important one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.664" offset="4502570">It is also one whose optimum solution is not readily apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.294" offset="4529110">The National Labor Relations Board has adopted one solution to that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.387" offset="4549486">The California Agriculture Labor Act has adopted another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.793" offset="4563069">NLRB solution is to hold the election during the next employment peak and the California procedure or the California solution is to hold the election rather quickly to decide only the question of representation and then once that's decided to defer all other issues until after the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.748" offset="4638929">There is absolutely no authority except the opinion which we ask this Court to reverse that has ever held that the selection of either these solutions raises significant constitutional problems, none.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.512" offset="4702041">In that respect alone the district court's decision is surprising enough, but the absolutely incredible feature of the district court's holding is that it has invalided an election scheme that permits and indeed anticipates the adoption of either alternative according to the needs of the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.644" offset="4786573">That has never been -- it has never been disputed and even if you assume that one of those or the other could be held unconstitutional, even as a matter of abstract theory, the position cannot be taken that a procedure which permits the adoption of either according to the needs of the particular case is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.912" offset="4879569">There is a statement in the motion to affirm to this effect that the Act must be nullified in all its provisions and returned to the legislature to strike a new balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.598" offset="4926380">I find that statement absolutely intriguing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.704" offset="4938815">What new balance is to be struck?</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.637" offset="4954488">As I read the District Court's opinion and the Appellee's briefs, the only constitutionally acceptable alternative is the California Act and yet Arizona law, it says not been disputed by our opponents permits the adoption of the Californian procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.512" offset="5037976">Now, pursuant to Justice White's urging, let me simply take about 30 seconds, Mr. Chief Justice and just observe this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.636" offset="5074442">First, with regard to the truthful publicity I think the Friedman versus Rogers is a valuable additional case that bears on the question of the extent of Arizona's authority to prohibit untruthful speech and I'm referring particularly to the comments on page 8 of that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.721" offset="5154795">With regard to compulsory arbitration under the Seventh Amendment and substantive due process our opponents are virtually thrown in the towel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.328" offset="5189277">They have an additional argument, I'll deal with that in response, if it needs to be dealt with, I'm not sure what position they take.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.475" offset="5217802">And finally, with regard to access to employer facilities, as we point out in our brief that depends on three assumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.232" offset="5248836">They have not disputed the fact that it depends on three assumptions and they've really only attacked one of the three, and for these and many reasons, we submit that the Federal District Court should never been involved been in this case in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.142" offset="5296483">It committed numerous errors and most egregious of which was its deciding a dispute that it's not a case or controversy and we submit those judgments.</text>

            <text syncTime="4154.560" offset="16618162">May I simple point out that most of my friend Mr. Cohen's argument has been directed to portions of the statute as to which there is no record or not presented in the either the questions presented in the jurisdictional statement nor in the motion to affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="4177.804" offset="16711158">There are no findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.031" offset="16720039">There have been no even determination by the district court and as a consequence those issues come before this Court at this time for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4189.832" offset="16759327">And that aside from everything else whether that amounts to case or controversy or simple good judicial procedure does not make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4197.885" offset="16791510">Most of Mr. Cohen's argument has been directed toward the TRO procedure, B7, B10, and B12. Let me turn however, very briefly to those and give my response though I say that a fortiori this is not being a case or controversy as to those issues that the district court did decide, it's certainly is not a case or controversy as to those issues that the district court did not decide and that were not included as part of the questions presented in the jurisdictional papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.473" offset="16909793">First, with the regard to TROs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4229.646" offset="16918570">This has been the principal procedure objection that has been raised all along, but let me isolate the issue very precisely.</text>
            <text syncTime="4237.288" offset="16949081">I agree with Mr. Cohen that Rule 65 of the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure is made a part of everyone of those TRO proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4245.512" offset="16981995">Rule 65 of the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure is identical to the federal rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.339" offset="17001326">There are only two differences, one has a comma where the other one doesn't, and one says ‘and' where the other one says ‘or.'</text>
            <text syncTime="4257.041" offset="17028075">Carroll did not say, Carroll did not say that under no circumstances, can there be temporary restraining orders without notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4265.612" offset="17062348">The rule in Carroll is identical to the Federal Rule 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="4271.730" offset="17086903">So that what my opponents are in effect asking this Court at this time is to hold Rule 65 unconstitutional, including the Federal Rule and they are also asking that Carroll be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="4284.352" offset="17137371">Now, with regard to the B7 arguments, that case, as this Court will recognize, simply reverses for Arizona purposes (Inaudible) case that came down in 1964 and makes it alright to or makes it a secondary boycott in effect to induce, encourage and so forth management employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4305.354" offset="17221381">Now there was -- I look at (Inaudible) recently this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.510" offset="17234024">There is no hint of a constitutional basis for (Inaudible) holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4313.158" offset="17252624">Mr. Cohen is very creative and I'll grant you that if you take his interpretation of that statute that when you say those oranges have been treated with dangerous pesticides, don't buy them, but that raises serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="4327.272" offset="17309048">First Amendment questions, I couldn't agree more.</text>
            <text syncTime="4329.825" offset="17319288">But I vigorously disagree that that's what that statute means and I think that for the first time in this Court, when it has never been considered by the lower court when there is no record on it and when there is nothing anywhere in that enforcement stipulation, that has even a hint of that kind of an enforcement of B7 that this is the time to be applying it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4349.112" offset="17396402">Now with regard to B12 and this prohibition of organizational activities after an election has been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4359.856" offset="17439347">The real fear there -- B12 is simply a counterpart of the federal rule that says where you had an election or where a petition has been filed within 12 months, then further picketing and organizational activity is prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="4374.784" offset="17499115">The fear is that that will be used for an improper purpose and I can see fully the possibility of its being used for an improper purpose, just the same as in Friedman versus Rogers there was a possibility of an improper hearing being held.</text>
            <text syncTime="4387.216" offset="17548852">But if, it were used for that purpose then it is very clear that under a combination of 1383 and 1385 A1, it's an unfair labor practice, and there would be a defense to it for that reason and that reason alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="4402.980" offset="17611860">As a consequence this conjures of defects all of which combine to exercise and effect on associational interest that is management rights, boycott, talking to manager of the store, talking about pesticides are illusory in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4418.289" offset="17673091">They depend again on hypothesis, on speculation and they are hypotheses and speculation with which we vigorously disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="4425.984" offset="17703915">Now in that regard, look at Tree Fruits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4429.505" offset="17717917">There is no question that in Tree Fruits just as the amicus says this Court went to great lengths to construe that statute in such a way as to – as to save it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4440.075" offset="17760235">And it did so, in fact, in reading out that language except picketing that is contained in the 8B42B proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="4449.013" offset="17795971">It did so because of its First Amendment concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="4451.840" offset="17807360">Now, a decent respect we submit for a comity within a federal system and for the respect of one judicial system for another judicial system indicates that the same approach ought to be or the same difference ought to be accorded to the Arizona courts.</text>
