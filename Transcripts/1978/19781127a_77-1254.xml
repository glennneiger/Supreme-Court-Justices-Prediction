            <text syncTime="18.485" offset="178322">This appeal presents the question, whether Section 632 of the Foreign Service Act of 1946, which requires that persons covered by the Foreign Service retirement system to retire at age 60, violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment to United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.433" offset="278110">Appellees are six former and four current Foreign Service employees in the Department of State or the International Communications Agency, formerly the United States Information Service and an organization representing such employees, filed this action to challenge the validity of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.881" offset="371942">They made statutory as well as constitutional claims and sought a declaration of invalidity, injunctive relief, back pay and reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.551" offset="422619">The District Court dismissed the primary non-constitutional claims, including the age discrimination and employment claim and appellees abandoned the remaining non-constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.909" offset="488030">A three-judge court was then convened to consider the constitutional contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.034" offset="516556">Appellants contended that the constitutional issue was a question of law and moved for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.528" offset="546544">Appellees argue that the resolution of the constitutional issue required the presentation of evidence to show that there was no rational basis for distinguishing between Foreign Service employees, who must retire at age 60 and civil service employees who at that time could continue to work until age 70.</text>

            <text syncTime="190.987" offset="868373">Male officers, I believe had to move up or out after nine years in grade and female officers, 13 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.005" offset="904422">And this Court found that there was a sufficient difference in their circumstances because of the different nature of assignments so that the female officer had fewer chances for promotion and therefore she might be given 13 years in grade instead of nine and of course that impinges upon the issue here as we will argue subsequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.891" offset="999926">At the time this action was brought, Civil Service employees were required to retire at age 70, but on April 6, 1978, Congress enacted the Age Discrimination in Employment Act Amendments of 1978, repealing the statute requiring most civil servants to retire at age 70 and currently effective September 30, 1978, there is no compulsory retirement age for most civil servants.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.876" offset="1575873">I believe, I believe, I recall that, but it would seem logically to me that as Mr. Justice Rehnquist has suggested that we couldn't pull age 70 out of the air and impose it.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.258" offset="1641388">On the basis of affidavits from both sides and submissions in response to the court's request for supplementation of the record the Court treated the case as if it had been submitted on cross-motions for summary judgment and declared the mandatory retirement provision unconstitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.494" offset="1722368">We submit that the court correctly recognized that neither fundamental rights nor suspect classes are involved in the distinction between Foreign Service employees and civil service employees and that therefore the rational basis test is the appropriate one and that the statute therefore is presumptively valid and the challengers have a heavy burden of proving invalidity.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.030" offset="1844517">Nevertheless, although it applied as we suggest the proper standard, the court held.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.841" offset="1875759">“On the record established in this case, the early mandatory retirement cannot survive even this minimal scrutiny.”</text>
            <text syncTime="453.574" offset="1918704">The court in considering the proffered justifications, first that the special stresses and unique burdens of employment in the Foreign Service is a result of frequent and extensive changes in environment, often accompanied by exposure to unfamiliar and unfavorable living conditions and second the implementation that it afforded to the personal management program for foreign service officers did not discuss the legislative history at all of these two purposes, but made its own assessment of the employment conditions of foreign service and civil service employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.926" offset="2088082">And in doing so it concluded that less that 10% of the American civilians who work overseas for the government are forced to retire at age 60 as many of the overseas personnel -- personnel not subject to mandatory retirement have jobs similar to those of the foreign service personnel and may be stationed also in hardship posts.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.229" offset="2185362">Accordingly, it held upon this determination that a system under which some federal employees working abroad are singled out for early retirement is “patently arbitrary and irrational and it invalidated the legislation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="539.328" offset="2261744">We contend that the District Court erred in not considering the legislative history, and in substituting its judgment for the decision of the Congress to create a separate foreign service with its own combination of benefits and obligations.</text>

            <text syncTime="603.255" offset="2517431">This Court held in Usery versus Turner Elkhorn Mining that the constitutionality of an act of Congress maybe sustained by looking solely to concerns expressed in the congressional hearings and debates because in that case the three-judge court refused to accept evidence and this court satisfied itself of the rational relationship by merely looking at the congressional history.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.326" offset="2641669">This Court also in Whalen versus Roe in 1977, considered a challenge to a New York drug prescription computer scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.552" offset="2698616">That was a scheme under which a physician dispensing certain Schedule II drugs, which were opium derivatives and cocaine was required to prepare in triplicate a report indicating the name of the physician who prescribed the drug, the name and address of the patient and the quantity of the drug prescribed and then to turn this over to the state government, which then would place it into a computer bank and the intention was to determine whether there was a recurrence of prescription by certain physicians or the filling of prescriptions unduly by certain pharmacists or the acquisition of narcotics by certain patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.519" offset="2926508">This was challenged and the Court said this that the state's interest in control of narcotic drugs is valid and the scheme is reasonably related and the fact that the District Court held that the state had failed to demonstrate that it was working -- was not invalidating.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.964" offset="3024206">It said it was enough to see that there was a rational relationship between the scheme and the objective which was a control of the narcotics trade or traffic.</text>

            <text syncTime="744.123" offset="3080840">It was not an equal protection case, but it's illustrative we submit here in showing that the failure of proof to show that a scheme works, it doesn't destroy a determination that it's rational and doesn't therefore require the court to invalidate it and that seems to be what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.902" offset="3183971">The District Court entertained evidence and determined that large numbers of civil servants were living abroad under circumstances, which it found indistinguishable, at least legally indistinguishable from those of the foreign service people who are under the mandatory retirement and for that reason determine that there was no rationality to the program and we suggest that if the rationality is demonstrated, evidence that it doesn't include everyone or that it might be done in another way or that it just doesn't work, doesn't invalidate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.857" offset="3379785">As a matter of fact in Whalen versus Roe, the Court quotes from Mr. Justice Brandeis, who suggests that the states must be given latitude to experiment in methods of solving the problems with which it's confronted.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.574" offset="3454704">And if the program is rationally related, the state should be given an opportunity to see whether it works and it shouldn't be invalidated just because it cannot demonstrate on a challenge that it is working.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.076" offset="3520742">Another quotation from that if I may, the New York statute challenged in this case presents a considered attempt to deal with such a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.855" offset="3563792">It is manifestly the product of an orderly and rational legislative decision and we submit that the language that is manifestly, the product means that this Court will apply its experience and its general knowledge to determine rationality and it doesn't require evidentiary proof of a relationship, but that is exactly what the Court below did in substituting its judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1741.078" offset="7068693">I want to make it very clear that all that is involved in this case is a question of whether this particular group of white collar office workers are unable to perform the particular jobs that they are assigned in the Foreign Service between the ages of 60 and 70 or are less able to perform than are employees under the age of 60.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.945" offset="7168167">This, to affirm the Court's decision below will not require this Court to upset its decision in Murgia nor will it require this Court to hold that mandatory retirement can never be applied to people such as the uniformed policemen in Murgia, who have physical jobs and for whom an earlier mandatory retirement age can be said to have a rational basis to the particular jobs that they have to perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.238" offset="7285300">And certainly in the armed forces we all know that our military men and women must be in combat readiness and must be either fighting war, or prepare to fight wars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.592" offset="7326783">My point now however that in the defense department all of the civilian employees, large numbers of whom travel throughout the world and in fact spend 15, 20 and 25 years in service overseas are not subject to early mandatory retirement but in fact are treated as civil service employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.747" offset="7407344">Mr. Justice Rehnquist who referred to the point you raised with Mr. Solicitor General, this case will raise only the issue of whether employees in the Foreign Service between the ages of 60 and 70 were able to perform the work of the Foreign Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.999" offset="7492399">The court below asked us on several occasions, whether we were claiming that mandatory retirement within the age is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.746" offset="7527403">And, we made it very clear that we were not making that claim and the evidence that we submitted went primarily to show that employees between the ages of 60 and 70 are able to perform their particular jobs of the Foreign Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.580" offset="7586753">We've really did not try to introduce the evidence or to make the argument that employees over the age of 70 can also perform that work.</text>

            <text syncTime="2910.977" offset="11748268">Moreover the colloquy omits the context in which it occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.543" offset="11774600">If you will look at our brief, I believe on page 29 to 30 of our brief, you will see the full colloquy set forth and you will see that in 1924, there was no retirement system whatsoever for consular and diplomatic officers and purport of that Rogers Act was to give to certain place a retirement system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.836" offset="11875746">It was to give an opportunity for Foreign Service officers to retire and to receive a pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.387" offset="11893927">There was no consideration of whether or not Foreign Service employees had to retire at age 65 because they were no longer able to perform the work overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.996" offset="11944396">In 1946, when this provision came into effect, the legislative history is silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.145" offset="11968951">There was no discussion of the age 60 provision.In fact, it is curious that as world health standards have improved and life expectancy has increased over the years, the retirement age in the Foreign Service has gotten lower and lower.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.906" offset="12027988">Before 1924 there was no retirement age, in 1924 when life expectancy was 58, the retirement age was 65 and now from 1945 to the present time the age is lowered to 60 when the life expectancy is now 73 or 74 and we all know that world conditions have improved since 1924 and 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.092" offset="12124745">We now for example have jet transportation and modern medical facilities at virtually every Foreign Service post.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.453" offset="12162257">Moreover, the Solicitor General noted that ambassadors or noted that Foreign Service employees are subject to terrorist attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.576" offset="12206665">However, there is no evidence that the terrorist attack is age related.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.779" offset="12227563">Foreign Service employees moreover are not armed, are not expected to resist or counter terrorist attack or other violence and in fact we send our ambassadors who are not subject to mandatory retirement age to some of the most violent prone posts in the world as we all know Elizabeth Bunker served in Vietnam, at the heart of the Vietnam War at the age of 80.</text>

            <text syncTime="3066.325" offset="12369669">Now let's look at the facts underlying the government's argument that mandatory retirement is a necessary management tool, which the government needs to make room for younger officers thereby ensuring components of the ambassadorial or other high levels of the officer core.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.248" offset="12429437">At the outset, let's keep in mind that 3,000 of these employees or one-third of the 10,000 workforce are not even officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.840" offset="12459739">There are librarians and school teachers and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.338" offset="12469770">And mandatory retirement of these employees hardly ensures confidence at the ambassadorial or other high levels of the officer core.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.567" offset="12502685">Secondly, we are talking about a a de minimus number of employees who are likely even to want to continue to work past the age of 60.</text>

            <text syncTime="3133.910" offset="12639984">Well that's the point I was just beginning to make Mr. Justice Burger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.945" offset="12656180">We are talking about the fact that only 50 employees, 44 officers are still on the employment rolls at the age of 59.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.569" offset="12694632">The overwhelmingly most common age for retirement among social retirees today is age 62.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.398" offset="12718038">Only 5,000 of 1% of Federal Civil Service employees, Civil Service employees even stay under the civil service rolls until age 70.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.760" offset="12763387">There was such a de minimis number of officers at age 60, who are likely to want to continue to work past 60 that it simply is not creditable that they are going to clog up the upper levels of the foreign service or that they are going to in fact have an appreciable effect on morale or recruitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.888" offset="12839978">Moreover keep in mind that in the Foreign Service, unlike the civil service an employee is not hired to perform a particular job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.381" offset="12869966">A Foreign Service employee must accept assignment to any post in the world and must perform any job given him whether or not it is of nature ordinarily performed by someone at that rank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.186" offset="12917091">In fact, it is quite common in the Foreign Service for employees to perform work that does not commensurate with their grade level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.080" offset="12944677">The Foreign Service also has broad administrative authority to assign its employees to other government agencies, to state and local governments, to non-profit organizations and to universities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.068" offset="12988667">Thus the Foreign Service has a variety of mechanisms to ensure that there is turnover both at the top level jobs and in every other jobs to provide employees with new job assignments and new challenges and to bring to any positions in the Foreign Service employees who have not previously served in them and who may have new ideas and let's look at the kind of employee that is likely to be in this scoop of 50 employees still on the employment rolls at the Foreign Service at the age of 60.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.247" offset="13105382">Every year, 11,000 applicants apply for the Foreign Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.003" offset="13120428">Only 100 to 200 are taken in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.609" offset="13138819">However, they enter they are rank ordered every year, the bottom portions of the classes are selected out, those who are not promoted are selected out, those who fail by any or medical examinations are selected out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.150" offset="13188974">There are voluntary retirements at age 50, beginning at age 50 with age 55 being the most common age of voluntary retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.280" offset="13221470">People resign shortly after they enter the foreign service when they find that foreign service life is not to their liking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.138" offset="13244980">And thus of the 44 officers who remain in the service at age 59, they are presumably by the department's own criteria the cream of the crop.</text>
