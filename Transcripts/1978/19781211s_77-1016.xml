            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="15.322" offset="61231">The United California Bank case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.375" offset="97489">We agree to take and review the case because the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit had arrived at a different answer to the issue involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.327" offset="141270">That issue is how a decedent's estate part of the residue of which is reserved for charity is to calculate his income tax for years in which it has substantial long term capital gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.670" offset="194664">Because in the light of recent amendments to the tax laws, this case very likely has no prospective significance and because in any event, it would not measurably advance the law to attempt orally to explain the intricacies of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.506" offset="254015">I shall simply say that we agree with the result reached by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and with the taxpayer in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.876" offset="283481">For those interested enough, our reasons are set out in an opinion on file with the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.453" offset="305737">The Court of Appeals' judgment is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.253" offset="320993">Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stewart and Rehnquist have joined.</text>
