            <label>Mr. Patrick B. Kimberlin III</label>
            <text syncTime="37.725" offset="254307">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.033" offset="267473">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.205" offset="280221">I am Patrick Kimberlin, Assistant Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Kentucky and it is the Commonwealth of Kentucky which is the petitioner in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.673" offset="314075">The facts of this case stated briefly are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.853" offset="326823">On May the 16th 1976, in the evening hours in suburbs of Louisville, Kentucky the respondent, Harold Whorton entered a fast food restaurant armed with a pistol and a knife, and robbed that restaurant, the employees, and he took money from the cash register.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.354" offset="396831">And while he was there, he took the knife and cut the telephone lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.946" offset="407176">He then left the restaurant, fled the scene in a 1967 blue Oldsmobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.997" offset="431313">Seven days later on the 23rd of May, he committed yet another robbery again in the evening hours, again in the suburbs of Louisville, again a fast food restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.508" offset="469452">Again armed with a knife and a pistol and he robbed that restaurant taking money from the cash register and fled the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.616" offset="493798">Finally, again seven days later on June the 1st 1976 he robbed the last fast food again in the suburbs of Louisville, Kentucky in the evening hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.413" offset="537057">Again he pulled the -- this time he pulled the telephone from the wall, fired a shot into the ceiling and robbed a number of patrons of the restaurant as well as the employees, and again took money from the cash register.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.901" offset="582928">However, during the course of this final robbery, one of the patrons managed to slip away and advised the police of what was happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.375" offset="612916">Just as Harold Whorton was fleeing the scene, the police arrived and gave chase.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.448" offset="633187">In a short while, they forced Whorton off the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.562" offset="649592">The car he was in was a blue ‘67 Oldsmobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.052" offset="663594">He got out off the car, flourished a weapon but dropped it at the command of the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.817" offset="686686">The police seized him, the weapon and some money from the automobile and returned him immediately to the scene at that last robbery where 10 individuals who had been at that fast food restaurant positively identified him as the man who just victimized them.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.476" offset="741230">Thereafter, in the Jefferson County grand jury returned three separate indictments one for each of these three robberies.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.853" offset="766830">These indictments were joined for trial and the trial was held in the Jefferson Circuit Court in Jefferson County, Kentucky in September 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.022" offset="803506">During the course of that trial, the Commonwealth of Kentucky introduced an abundance of evidence establishing the guilt of Harold Whorton on the charges that were brought against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.109" offset="839764">At the -- the evidence presented by Whorton was only that of his sister and his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.875" offset="866826">Those two ladies testified that on the evening of one of the three robberies, he was with them, thus attempting to establish an alibi.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.056" offset="899636">Harold Whorton did not take the stand to testify in his own defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.167" offset="916041">The conclusion of all the evidence, Harold Whorton requested an instruction on presumption of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.416" offset="941014">The trial court refused the requested instruction as per the law in the Commonwealth of Kentucky at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.527" offset="973511">The jury returned verdicts finding Harold Whorton guilty on 10 counts of first-degree robbery, two counts of attempt to commit first-degree robbery, and two counts of wanton endangerment.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.079" offset="1019695">Whorton, thereafter, pursued an appeal to the Kentucky Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.079" offset="1039653">While that appeal was spinning in the Kentucky Supreme Court, this Court rendered its decision on May 30, 1978 in the case of Taylor versus Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.317" offset="1084688">Seven days later, argument was heard in the Kentucky Supreme Court on the case at bar, Whorton versus Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.637" offset="1125961">The Taylor case was before the Kentucky Supreme Court at the time of the oral argument and they considered that course at great length in the body of their opinion which was rendered on -- I believe on June 25th of 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.085" offset="1191685">The opinion of the Kentucky Supreme Court resulted in the reversal of all 14 charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.341" offset="1212688">Two of the charges, the wanton endangerment charges were reversed upon double jeopardy grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.637" offset="1233899">However, all the 10 first-degree robbery charges as well as the two attempted first-degree robbery charges were reversed upon the ground of the interpretation given by the Kentucky Supreme Court to this Court's opinion in Taylor versus Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.209" offset="1288234">The Kentucky Supreme Court interpreted Taylor versus Kentucky to mean that a newly declared constitutional requirement had been created by this Court in Taylor, and at that newly declared constitutional requirement was at the presumption of innocence when an instruction is requested on the presumption of innocence, it must be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.191" offset="1380185">If the request is rejected by the trial court, it's a violation of due process of law and reversal must be had.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.372" offset="1412890">At the conclusion of the majority opinion in the Kentucky Supreme Court, it would appear that an open invitation was given for review if that interpretation that the Kentucky Supreme Court gave to Taylor meant anything other than what the Kentucky Supreme Court saw it to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.248" offset="1476315">As a consequence of this interpretation, we feel that there has been a serious hindrance of the criminal -- Effective Administration of Criminal Justice in Kentucky because as of this time we now have 50 cases which will be automatically reversed as a consequence of the decision in Whorton, and the interpretation it gave to the Taylor case.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.511" offset="1557400">All these cases, many of them are already reversed or in stages of will be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.004" offset="1575372">The majority of them have been reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.802" offset="1582582">In addition to this case which the petition for certiorari was granted here on January the 8th, we have four other cases pending right now on petition for certiorari that have already reached this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.432" offset="1629080">Our argument is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.809" offset="1638588">The first is that it is our belief that the opinion of this Court in Taylor versus Kentucky means that the Taylor decision is limited to its own facts and is of narrow application and does not create a per se constitutional rule requiring automatic reversal on due process grounds under the Fourteenth Amendment if a presumption of innocence instruction was requested and then refused by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.257" offset="1740361">We feel that the interpretation that should be given to the Taylor case is that constitutional error may occur on an ad hoc basis and the true constitutional principle involved in Taylor is not the giving or not giving in a mandatory sense of a presumption of innocence instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.781" offset="1814444">But the principle that is constitutionally protected then in accusing a criminal can be tried only on the basis of probative evidence actually adduced at trial and beyond the reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.161" offset="1868048">It is this principle which the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was invoked by this Court we believe in the Taylor case in order to ensure in effect a fair and reasonable trial in the Taylor case, and as we know of course what happened in the Taylor case was during the course of that trial, many numerous extraneous negative circumstances arouse, extraneous from the evidence that had nothing at all to do from the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.385" offset="1968880">Comments made by the prosecutor in his opening statement with respect to inferences to be drawn from an indictment which was read to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.566" offset="2001586">Comments made by the prosecutor in his summation with respect to equating the status of a defendant with that of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.772" offset="2038471">And then all the defendants who are brought to the bar are guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.096" offset="2051741">These -- there are numerous comments to this effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.437" offset="2069086">Given the circumstances of the Taylor case, the petitioner who was Taylor in that case, urged that under these particular circumstances in Taylor, the presumption of innocence instruction which was requested should've been given in order to protect the principle that a man is to be tried only upon the basis of the evidence adduced at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.314" offset="2148603">And of course this Court noted in the Taylor case that the purpose of the presumption of innocence instruction is to protect the principle that a man is only to be -- that a man is to be found guilty only on the basis of the proof adduced at trial in no extraneous matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.249" offset="2220387">As I think also if we go to the case of Estelle versus Williams where this Court noted in that case that a presumption of innocence serves the purpose of -- its purpose is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.630" offset="2273886">One is to show that -- remind the jury that the burden of persuasion is with the Government and it must carry its burden of persuasion beyond the reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.497" offset="2313383">And secondly, that it has a purging effect to -- it can forestall the consideration by the jury of extraneous matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.423" offset="2353089">It was the purging effect which this Court I believe felt that was so important in the Taylor case.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.019" offset="2371480">It was necessary to purge some of the -- or all of the extraneous matters which arose during the course of that trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.794" offset="2402513">We submit that if there are no extraneous matters occurring during the course of the trial upon which the jury could improperly base or assume the guilt of the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.235" offset="2452355">And if their verdict is based solely upon the overwhelming evidence of guilt, properly is presented at trial, the no constitutional error occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.886" offset="2490911">That given certain circumstances as in Taylor, given the degree of negative circumstances as in Taylor, an accumulative effect of those negative circumstances they can pyramid one on top of the other until there can be a violation of due process of law in the absence of an instruction on presumption of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.081" offset="2567711">However, we respectfully submit that in the absence of the negative circumstances, there is no constitutional mandate that the presumption of innocence instruction as a per se rule is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.740" offset="2622360">Thus, we submit that in this case there was no violation of any constitutional standard simply because we do not have in comparison of the facts of this case to those in the Taylor case the type of improper comments made by the prosecutor throughout the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.406" offset="2692995">We do not have a situation where we have a mere swearing contest between two witnesses as in Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.567" offset="2717654">The victim there testified was the only person who testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.559" offset="2733641">The defendant testified was the only person who testified for the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.687" offset="2746075">Here, we have 15 different witnesses who positively identified the accused as the man who victimized them on these three separate occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.407" offset="2780975">We have the testimony of police officers who gave chase and apprehended him first from the scene.</text>

            <text syncTime="1503.625" offset="6117857">The common sense of the matter to me is that there are three branches to Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.229" offset="6136247">First of all, this Court recognized the vital function of the presumption of innocence as a tool for the jury and therefore imposed an affirmative duty on trial judges to give life to the presumption for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.264" offset="6192462">However, at the same time the Court exalted substance over form and wisely refrained from a legislating form instruction containing magic words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.667" offset="6234049">To me the operative due process principle in Taylor is not that an instruction containing the magic words presumption of innocence must be conveyed to the jury in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.892" offset="6278980">But rather in some manner, the trial judge must reliably convey to the jury the substance of the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.400" offset="6308968">And on the particular facts before the Court in Taylor, this Court appears to me to have held that only an instruction would have conveyed the substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.536" offset="6345540">I submit that the Kentucky court in Whorton correctly discerned the principle which I have enunciated and said in effect as applied to Kentucky cases, this means that it will have to be given in every case because we pride ourselves on bare-bones instructions which keep the trial court from reliably importing the substance of the presumption to the jury in any other way.</text>
