            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">We'll hear arguments next in Payton against New York and Riddick against New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.610" offset="291882">Mr. Hellerstein, I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_e_hellerstein" startTime="49.790" stopTime="170.870">
            <label>Mr. William E. Hellerstein</label>
            <text syncTime="49.790" offset="304630">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.394" offset="314974">These cases are before the Court on appeal from the New York Court of Appeals, which by a vote of four-to-three sustained the former and present New York arrest statutes which allow arrest entries even in the absence of non-exigent circumstances into the home and permit nonconsensual and forcible entries for the purpose of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.172" offset="414135">Two cases before the Court present the statutes in two virtually kind of apprehensive applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.879" offset="444959">In the Payton case, you have the forcible, and I would say extremely forcible entry without a warrant, namely the breaking down of Mr. Payton's door with crowbars.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.675" offset="488114">In the Riddick case, you have a nonconsensual but an entry with less force and I would say not exactly force, namely the knocking on a door, the opening of a door by a three year old boy, the entry to arrest and the placing of the defendant, who was in bed, under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.683" offset="564182">The facts leading up to both of these cases, in the Payton case, a homicide in the cause of robbery had been committed on January 12, 1970 in the service station in Manhattan's Upper East Side.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.122" offset="621861">Investigation at the scene led to the discussion of investigating officers with witnesses to two days later, the officer learning the name of Mr. Payton.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.691" offset="676195">One of the informants or people who spoke with the officer took the police on January 14, two days after the crime, sometime in the afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.196" offset="714230">Took the officer to Payton's building in the Bronx and pointed out his apartment to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.980" offset="737322">That detective, Detective Malfer, the investigating detective made no effort at that time to arrest the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.913" offset="769087">Instead he came back and the following morning and a company --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="170.870" offset="788940">Would it make a difference to your position if he had made the arrest with these steps right then and there?</text>

            <label>Mr. William E. Hellerstein</label>
            <text syncTime="177.279" offset="814540">I think it would be a tougher case for us Mr. Chief Justice, I think it would -- because then in the course of that ongoing situation, it might be argued by the prosecution that the circumstances were exigent in the sense that at the very first moment that Detective Malfer learned where a suspected felon for which he had probable cause lived, he might then have possibly consummated the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.834" offset="928747">But that's not what happened and I think that's --</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="207.245" offset="934390">Judge Walker felt that way in the Court of Appeals.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_e_hellerstein" startTime="209.529" stopTime="438.567">
            <label>Mr. William E. Hellerstein</label>
            <text syncTime="209.529" offset="943585">Judge Walker was the only judge Mr. Chief -- Mr. Justice Rehnquist, who felt that way, who felt that this -- and it was a continuous pursuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.562" offset="979634">I would submit that the concept continuous pursuit is still not exactly an exigent pursuit, a pursuit in exigent circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.057" offset="1017668">But I don't think you don't even have to agree with Judge Walker.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.012" offset="1033446">I think that the concept of continuous pursuit, in the Chief Justice' question, if that were the case would make it a tougher case.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.672" offset="1064061">I would not necessarily concede to the circumstances was still exigent, but that's not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.668" offset="1084123">The fact of the Payton case is that not having done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.264" offset="1102514">The officers -- the officer chose to wait until the following morning, some 12, 14 hours later.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.308" offset="1130621">When accompanied by other officers, attempted to enter Payton's apartment and not being able to do so still took additional time to call for assistance by a call to the emergency services division of the police department who came with crowbars and broke the apartment open, the door of the apartment open.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.878" offset="1216930">And Mr. Payton was not there, and even though Mr. Payton was not there, the officers ransacked the apartment, searched in cupboards, drawers, closets, under the mattress knowing he was not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.767" offset="1264473">Everything that was found was suppressed on consent by the district attorney because it was of course illegally seized in an unlawful search.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.927" offset="1309090">The one item of evidence that was not suppressed was a .30 caliber shell casing that was found ostensibly in plain view by Detective Malfer and was matched shell casings found in the scene of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.593" offset="1371784">The trial court and ultimately the Court of Appeals by a four-to-three vote sustained the admissibility of that shell casing on the ground that the officers were lawfully on the premises to consummate an arrest under New York's then Code of Criminal Procedure, Sections 177 and 178, they could break and enter without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.598" offset="1455794">The Riddick case somewhat different in the sense that the officers had probable cause to believe Mr. Riddick had committed a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.170" offset="1498112">In 1971, they had probable cause at least two months before they went to his apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.361" offset="1534892">Or I should say they learned his address two months before they went to his apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.717" offset="1548267">They had probable cause around earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.091" offset="1561746">The arrest in Riddick was extremely typical.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.044" offset="1573554">No great hurry, despite what the prosecution would call a violent crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.724" offset="1596332">They knew where Mr. Riddick was and waited two months.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.805" offset="1608662">Prosecution concedes that there was nothing at all negligent about the Riddick case.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.525" offset="1635516">That brings before the Court the issue of the constitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.703" offset="1656205">The Court of Appeals by a majority vote, I think placed its emphasis on three concepts or items.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.036" offset="1693612">The first that an arrest entry is a much more substantial intrusion than an entry for the purpose of a search for which this Court has required warrants and that the history of a common law with respect to arrest entries was extremely well settled and clear and supported the Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.545" offset="1783578">The Court also placed an emphasis on the existence of statutes similar to New York's and many states and upon the proposal of the American Law Institute not recommending a warrant be obtained in these particular circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.953" offset="1845227">It is our submission that the Court erred on all three respects.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="438.567" offset="1859647">Mr. Hellerstein, you said of the three factors, you said one of them was that the court's view that an arrest entry was more intrusive or less intrusive?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_e_hellerstein" startTime="447.747" stopTime="448.947">
            <label>Mr. William E. Hellerstein</label>
            <text syncTime="447.747" offset="1896427">Less intrusive.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="448.947" stopTime="449.617">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="448.947" offset="1901234">That's what I thought.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_e_hellerstein" startTime="449.617" stopTime="481.889">
            <label>Mr. William E. Hellerstein</label>
            <text syncTime="449.617" offset="1903846">Yes, I'm sorry if I'm mistaken, it was less intrusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.337" offset="1926729">I think the logical starting point for our argument must be the plurality opinion of this Court in Coolidge where at that time four members of the Court expressed a view that a warrantless entry into a person's home to arrest was at odds with the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment, the per se requirement for searches.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="481.889" stopTime="509.173">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="481.889" offset="2032995">When you use the term entry, Mr. Hellerstein, supposing that in the Riddick case for example the police had come up the steps onto a porch and the door had been open and hadn't been or it was shut and then opened by a three year old, and simply on the steps they had seen Riddick in the house, in the room and in bed as he was, would that be an entry?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_e_hellerstein" startTime="509.173" stopTime="643.785">
            <label>Mr. William E. Hellerstein</label>
            <text syncTime="509.173" offset="2142083">Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.065" offset="2145635">I believe it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.049" offset="2153576">It might be the most peaceable entry, but it would definitely be an entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.383" offset="2170922">I think they would have had to obtain permission to cross the threshold and come into Mr. Riddick's room.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.028" offset="2209583">I think the views expressed in Coolidge hopefully will be able to support the conclusion of our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.791" offset="2240616">I think that there is one interest that has predominated this Court's decisions both in holding and in dicta as I read them.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.872" offset="2268933">It is that the expectation of privacy within the home is the highest of its kind that there is nothing more sanctified, in our constitutional system both historically and juridically, and that the privacy of the home is paramount.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.663" offset="2352107">It is a place where people repair, to enjoy in their utmost, their thoughts, their personal feelings, their family life and although in Katz the Court spoke of the Fourth Amendment of protecting people not places.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.042" offset="2421593">I believe that was supplemental to the notion that the home is a place where the privacy interest is at its highest.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.333" offset="2454716">Without his background and I'm not so sure that the prosecution if -- even disagrees with what I've said to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.283" offset="2486585">The Court of Appeals I think erred grievously in about seven different respects in concluding that an arrest entry was less substantial than one for purposes of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.103" offset="2533815">When police enter private premises, that entry first of all affects everybody in the premises, there's family, children.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.918" offset="2585119">The manner of the entry is not designed to ensure the privacy of the people within or to minimize the intrusion on their privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.003" offset="2625452">I think we've pointed out in our briefs that actual manuals by recognized experts, police conduct and practice point out the nature of the way that entry should be made.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="643.785" stopTime="663.496">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="643.785" offset="2680519">But -- but what again if you have the door open and the people simply doing whatever they're doing in the front room with obviously no intent to conceal it.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.759" offset="2728479">The windows are open, the door is open anyone walking on the sidewalk can see it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_e_hellerstein" startTime="663.496" stopTime="784.101">
            <label>Mr. William E. Hellerstein</label>
            <text syncTime="663.496" offset="2759408">I don't know how common that would be Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.145" offset="2778008">If the problem is that people who open the door expose what is within to the -- open eye, they are responsible for minimizing their privacy, but that might be impossible with respect to a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.650" offset="2844045">But to arrest, the entry is the key.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.677" offset="2856166">It is the crossing of the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.715" offset="2864316">Now there may not be the kind of intrusion in that particular situation that would be the most minimal, but there is nonetheless the intrusion, also the police may still enter in the same way they would've if they had to go to the door and knock it or break it down in the force of four or five perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.725" offset="2940280">Both Riddick and Payton exemplary cases of more than one officer going, they might still enter even though the door will open, fan out, conduct the protective sweep which is recommended by the authorities and which I think is rather a common place, and that is a substantial intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.703" offset="3012274">It's a substantial intrusion because in conducting a fan out or a protective sweep, there is immediately open to view of the police whatever items, supposedly personal items the occupants of the premises have, and I would say that even conducting a search incident to that arrest is nonetheless a search of a good deal of intensity.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.558" offset="3111643">The search of a person, in your hypothetical Mr. Justice Rehnquist, if the suspect is not in the room that's open to view and even though the entry is across a threshold without the breaking of a door, but the suspect say is in a backroom or in the Warden case where -- Warden versus Hayden, where the court saw a search for a person that covered a multi-room house.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.049" offset="3217596">That can be also an extensive search for a person.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="784.101" offset="3241838">Including a washing machine in that case, wasn't it?</text>

            <label>Mr. William E. Hellerstein</label>
            <text syncTime="786.670" offset="3252078">I believe it was Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.893" offset="3269005">So as a general proposition, I think the intrusion for purposes of arrest are not minimal and they are not less than a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.309" offset="3306621">In fact I would submit that there are occasions when an entry for search can be far more -- far less intrusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.562" offset="3347686">In the two cases before the Court, I don't think you can conclude that there was a minimal intrusion of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.134" offset="3381959">For these types of intrusions, we submit that a warrant should be required, that there is nothing in the interest of law enforcements to preclude or to cut against requiring a warrant in these two situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.469" offset="3455310">The last decision of this Court dealt with the subject of warrants for arrest of course was the Watson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.640" offset="3488016">And this Court predicated its decision, as I read it, for dispensing with a warrant on several factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.173" offset="3522079">The publicness of the arrest to -- with the liberty interest was not so substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.150" offset="3549978">I think the Court of Appeals below in majority pointed to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.510" offset="3567428">But in this case or these cases you have what is the privacy interest as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.926" offset="3593132">But it was a case in which Mr. Justice Powell said that there were times that logic must refer to history and experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.169" offset="3622076">And because the history and experience of the common law with respect to public arrests was what it was in Watson, the Court felt that warrant should not be required for non-exigent public -- for any public arrests.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.615" offset="3683830">So we respectfully submit and I think we've try to in great length in our brief to establish that the common law with respect to entries into the home to arrest without a warrant was a bird of a different color.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.824" offset="3736701">In fact I believe the Court, opinion by Mr. Justice Brennan in Miller versus United States pointed first citing with approval Judge Prettyman's decision in Accarino versus United States which held that you would had to have a warrant to enter but as a minimal proposition pointed out to the disarray among the common law sources with respect to entries without a warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="934.782" offset="3844535">The Miller case was under 3109 of Title 18, Mr. Chief Justice, and it did involve the issue of knocking, announcing that -- but in the course of the Court's analysis as to the knock and announce statute, the common law sources with respect to the general proposition of entry without warrants was examined and pointed out to be insubstantial disarray.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.493" offset="3943382">In that disarray, we believe it does not afford the Court the freedom nor should it to conclude that the Watson line of analysis would be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.179" offset="4006181">The disarray continued beyond the common law into the 19th century.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.093" offset="4037841">And of course a number of stat -- states passed statutes similar to ours not requiring warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.635" offset="4072009">Interestingly, once Courts begun to look at these statutes and these practices under Fourth Amendment principles, the predominant overwhelming weight of lower court judicial authority, state and federal, has been to require warrants in non-error -- non-exigent circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.690" offset="4148182">The Second Circuit in United States against Reed in a recent decision which the Court of Appeals just did not feel it should follow so held, and the Courts of Appeals have predominated on that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.769" offset="4212548">The warrant requirement in the context of entries for home arrest will not impose any substantial legitimate burden of law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.839" offset="4256747">If the circumstances are non-exigent there is no reason for law officials -- law enforcement officials not to obtain a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.624" offset="4295931">The basic concern of the prosecution is that in such a circumstance the requirement to obtain a warrant will preclude catching dangerous criminals quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.853" offset="4340861">I believe Mr. Justice White in the Channel opinion, you also expressed that concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.373" offset="4366879">The fact of the matter is as I believe a test clause report which is cited on our brief of -- with respect to the President's commission on law enforcement initiation of justice, establishes that 50% of the arrest that are made throughout the country are made within two hours of the crime, 45% of the arrests, the remaining 45 are made a day after the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.923" offset="4477116">That conclusion led the Government in its brief in Santana for example to say it could easily live with a requirement of two hours plus for a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.644" offset="4524032">And in the Government's brief in the Watson case itself, it pointed out that the FBI as a practice obtains arrest warrants whenever practicable because it is in the interest of the Government to secure a warrant, that the scrutiny as to probable cause that the dangers of losing evidence because of suppression are minimized by obtaining a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.154" offset="4622043">We submit that the arguments presented by the prosecution that this nonetheless will be a burden on law enforcement are not -- do not meet the actual test.</text>

            <text syncTime="1328.912" offset="5421077">We're talking about here is not simply gathering evidence but bringing the defendant to Court so that the civilizing processes of law can even be brought to bear on that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1364.151" offset="5562034">And that is why the judgment has been made throughout history that it is better not to impose a lawyerized process before the arrest and that's regardless of where the arrest takes place, but rather that it is better first to obtain custody of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.095" offset="5649805">And then to construct a system whereby the defendant is given all the processes he is due.</text>

            <text syncTime="3464.685" offset="13964163">The notion of this burden of time, at least in urban areas, it is not correct that it takes six hours to get a warrant in New York County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.910" offset="14001048">We've cited in our reply brief, one case where it was two hours for a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.817" offset="14020692">Of course there's nothing in the record on the time, but I simply submit that six hours is not an accurate statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.025" offset="14045560">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, with respect to rural areas, I also submit that perhaps the time in obtaining a warrant might be relevant to an assessment as to whether the warrant was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.490" offset="14083385">But I think that would have to depend upon the situation in that rural county.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.492" offset="14099372">I also don't know that this Court would hold a magistrate, pure magistrate need issue the warrant under Shadow and the City of Tampa, it might find something less, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.623" offset="14155901">Now, third fact that Mr. Zimroth tells you was that once a warrant would be obtained, the police officer would have no alternative even though he now knew the fellow was innocent but to execute that warrant.</text>
