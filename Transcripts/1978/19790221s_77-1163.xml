            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="10.422" offset="41587">This case is here on appeal and cross-appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.823" offset="71262">The District Court invalidated a section of the Texas Optometry Act that prohibited the practice of optometry under a trade name.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.748" offset="110968">It held that the restriction violated First Amendment rights of commercial speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.265" offset="136986">The court rejected however a due process attack on another section of the Act requiring that three of the five members of the Texas Optometry Board be drawn for membership of a particular professional organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.209" offset="204800">In recent decisions, this Court has recognized that commercial speech enjoys a measure of First Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.362" offset="241371">But the Court also has emphasized that the distinctive characteristics of commercial speech make it permissible for a state to regulate such speech in a manner that would not be appropriate for other forms of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.484" offset="305842">We think that the Texas prohibition of the practice of optometry under a trade name is an example of permissible regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.305" offset="345130">The prohibition, the possibilities for abuse and deception attended upon issues of trade names where viewed as serious by the Texas legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.076" offset="392255">The record in this case includes a number of examples of such abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.665" offset="414616">The Texas restriction is addressed primarily to the problems of false and misleading information and has only a most limited effect on information that can be conveyed to consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.966" offset="471771">Since we conclude that the Texas law is a legitimate exercise of state authority, we reverse the decision of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.247" offset="512940">The Texas legislature also acted lawfully in requiring that a majority of the state's regulatory board be drawn from members of a professional organization, an organization that had standards consistent with the rules committed by the legislature to the board to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.731" offset="598831">We therefore affirm the Court's decision sustaining that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.450" offset="621714">Mr. Justice Blackmun with whom Mr. Justice Marshall joined has filed a separate opinion concurring in the judgment with respect to the membership requirement but dissenting from the decision with respect to the trade name.</text>
