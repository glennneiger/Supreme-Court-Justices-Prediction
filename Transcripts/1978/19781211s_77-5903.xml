            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">The other case I have to announce is McArthur Corbitt against the State of New Jersey, Number 77-5903.1</text>
            <text syncTime="9.933" offset="39706">This case involves a New Jersey conviction for first-degree murder, which the petitioner in this case, McArthur Corbitt asserts it is invalid because of the peculiar punishment pattern imposed by the New Jersey statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.934" offset="95713">In New Jersey, the mandatory punishment for a defendant found guilty by a jury of first-degree murder is life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.494" offset="129881">Second-degree murder is punishable by a prison term of up to 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.767" offset="150988">Those charged with murder however are permitted to tender a plea of non vult which is somewhat like a plea of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.914" offset="183589">If the plea is accepted, judgment of conviction follows and the defendant is subject to a sentence of either life imprisonment or a prison term up to 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.054" offset="228206">Because life imprisonment is mandatory if a defendant goes to trial and has found guilty of first-degree murder as Corbitt was whereas there is the possibility of a much lesser sentence if it plea is offered and accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.357" offset="285362">Corbitt claims that the statutory pattern is designed to encourage guilty pleas and that is sentence of life imprisonment is nothing more than an impermissible punishment for his refusal to plead non vult and for his insistence on a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.335" offset="357251">All in violation he says of his rights under the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.846" offset="387344">The New Jersey Supreme Court rejected these claims and for the reasons stated in an opinion we have filed today, we agree with the New Jersey court.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.508" offset="421930">New Jersey has not reserved the sentence of life imprisonment for those who go to trial in murder cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.711" offset="446798">That sentence may also be imposed by a judge who accepts a plea of non vult.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.904" offset="467592">And under our cases particularly those involving plea bargaining, a State does not violate the constitutional rights of a well counseled defendant as Corbitt was simply because it holds out the possibility or probability of a lesser punishment if the defendant pleads guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.700" offset="546795">And the judgment of the New Jersey Supreme Court is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.964" offset="559856">Mr. Justice Stewart has filed a separate opinion concurring in the judgment only.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.276" offset="577097">Mr. Justice Stevens has dissented and he is joined by Justices Brennan and Marshall.</text>
