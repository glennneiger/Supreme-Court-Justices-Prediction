            <text syncTime="29.513" offset="223441">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, reversing a discovery order of the District Court and establishing an absolute privilege of non disclosure of the editorial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.696" offset="288225">This is a Sullivan defamation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.082" offset="301704">It arises from a CBS 60 minutes program, produced by Barry Lando and Mike Wallace.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.888" offset="332946">In that program, the plaintiff Colonel Herbert, was portrayed as a liar, as one capable of committing acts of brutality in Vietnam, as an opportunist who had used the war crimes charge to cover up his own relief from command and is a perpetrator of a hoax on the American public.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.201" offset="434197">Plaintiff after the broadcast, brought the libel action which is now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.064" offset="457707">During the course of pre-trial, plaintiff sought to discover what the defendants had done and learned in the course of their investigation preparing for the program, and what the defendant's state of mind was on the matters which they had investigated and learned about during that investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.229" offset="546314">Questions were posed within that context to Mr. Lando and Mr. Wallace, as to what their state of mind was, as to matters actually presented on the program, as well as matters not presented on the program, and contradictory to the matters presented on the program.</text>

            <text syncTime="140.130" offset="665955">The issue -- the legal issue we were directed to was the issue of the subjective state of mind of the defendant's, whether there in fact they entertained that serious doubts as to the truth of matters presented on the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.880" offset="720917">Specifically it evolves in various contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.440" offset="735232">For example, during the deposition of Mr. Lando, we ascertained that he had interviewed, in one example, a group of five different soldiers and who had served with Colonel Herbert in Vietnam.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.059" offset="793642">Four of those soldiers told him certain things about Colonel Herbert's treatment in regard for the Vietnamese population.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.789" offset="824571">A fifth soldier told him a contrary story.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.227" offset="842334">Mr. Lando presented on the program only the statement of the fifth soldier, and failed to include on the program any reference to the statements of the four other soldiers which indicated the care and concern that Colonel Herbert had shown while he served in Vietnam.</text>

            <text syncTime="1730.346" offset="7026772">I would like to start if I may my outlining briefly what we considered at the time and still consider the vice of the District Court opinion and then to proceed to the opinion of the Court of Appeals and some of the questions which members of this Court have addressed, to Mr. Lubell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.239" offset="7098347">The crux of the District Court opinion, Mr. Lubell to the contrary was not that the questions asked went to the core of the case, and it was not that the questions asked provided information which could only be obtained from the journalists involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.574" offset="7159683">Those were not findings of the District Court and indeed as I read the District Court opinion they are inconsistent with the findings of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.355" offset="7190821">The District Court concluded as a matter of law that the concept of editorial process which we urged upon him, stemming from cases of this Court such as of the Miami Herald case, had nothing to do with the question of the scope of pretrial discovery in the Sullivan case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1793.940" offset="7281204">Our argument Mr. Chief Justice is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.831" offset="7292698">We think that what the court establish in the Tornillo case was, that it's now it was of course of the right of reply statute was unconstitutional, but broader than that, we think it established a First Amendment proposition, that at least to close inquiry into the editorial process of a newspaper or in this case a broadcaster, is itself barred or at least presumptively barred under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.663" offset="7388097">If it I can give you a hypothetical; if Florida had respondent to this courts ruling in the Tornillo case, by passing a new statute requiring that a newspaper which did not print an answer have to disclose why it didn't print an answer.</text>

            <label>Mr. Floyd Abrams</label>
            <text syncTime="1841.388" offset="7470958">I am without question or going beyond that case, what I am saying is that it does seem to us that the underlying theory of that case ought not to be limited to right of reply statutes any more than you would limit I think, Mills versus Alabama to limitations on what occurs on election day, and what can be printed by a newspaper on election day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.163" offset="7550056">We think what the court should do, but it has not yet done, and this was the first case since Tornillo in which this is raised, excuse me and what we think the Second Circuit concluded as well as that the underlying basis of Tornillo is not alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.278" offset="7618497">That right of reply statutes are unconstitutional, but that the choice of material by editors to go in newspapers are on broadcast, the treatment of material to go and the nature of content, as at least presumptively protect to just as I think it would be, if in the Florida case, the Florida legislature, again in the hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.270" offset="7698536">If the Florida legislature, after your ruling has subpoena to the editor of the editor of the Miami Herald and asked him the very questions, the very questions asked of Barry Lando in this case, in affect why did you print this and not that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.183" offset="7750154">What was the nature of your editorial decision making?</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.993" offset="7761439">I do not suggest that this is what the Court held in Tornillo, of course it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.864" offset="7776904">But we do think that it is consistent with Tornillo and that the kind of dedication to the notion of editorial process protection which is embodied in Tornillo itself, ought to be embodied here as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.616" offset="7827895">I think I can best illustrate it by reference to Mr. Lubell's answer to Mr. Justice Stevens earlier in which he was asked what's the best example that you've got.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.575" offset="7859764">What is that you are really loosing?</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.968" offset="7865302">What kind of questions aren't being answered here and Mr. Lubell gave an example which I think is a fair example, of a situation in which a particular individual was interviewed on the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.063" offset="7921622">On the page reference, if the Court wishes to see it later, is at 53(a) of the appendix and this person who had served with Colonel Herbert in the army, Bruce Potter by name, said on the program, that he was in a helicopter with Colonel Herbert and that in the helicopter next to Colonel Herbert, Colonel Herbert had suggested by thrusting a prisoner of war towards the open door of the helicopter, that he might throw him out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.106" offset="8045861">And the Colonel Herbert had as well thrown Sand bags out to suggest to people on the ground, a prisoner on the ground that, there were people being thrown out of planes and that therefore they should talk, and that's what Bruce Potter said.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jonathan W. Lubell</label>
            <text syncTime="3926.133" offset="15809975">Very briefly, in regard to reference to the Sullivan decision itself, the reference to the looking at the files, the issue that gets raised now by the Second Circuit decision is suppose an editor at the time that the work product was being worked up, the editorial process was going on, went to the files and looked at the files during that editorial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3952.233" offset="15914360">The question is, could we ask a question about what was done during the editorial process?</text>
            <text syncTime="3957.117" offset="15933900">I think that question is a serious question in light of the decision of the Second Circuit which appears to say that we can't inquire as to what was done during that process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3968.427" offset="15979144">In addition, in the Sullivan case itself, in reference to whether the media are the only groups of people that are protected under the Sullivan principles, I'm sure, needless to say, the Court is aware that individuals were as well, petitioners before this Court in Sullivan, the ministers themselves, and they were afforded the protection of the Sullivan principles as well as the New York Times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.507" offset="16075483">So I think from Sullivan on, there has been at least an implied recognition that the Sullivan principles protect anyone who exercises his First Amendment rights, first in regard to public officials, and subsequently in the decisions of this Court in regard to public figures.</text>

            <text syncTime="4012.057" offset="16153642">At the end of Judge Oakes' opinion, his last sentence, it refers to that he concurs in the general answer of Chief Judge Kaufman to the certified question.</text>

            <text syncTime="4076.658" offset="16412045">Well, at the very beginning, the Court of Appeal's opinion says, appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1292(b)?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jonathan_w_lubell" startTime="4081.923" stopTime="4227.888">
            <label>Mr. Jonathan W. Lubell</label>
            <text syncTime="4081.923" offset="16433152">Yes, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.721" offset="16440257">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.330" offset="16442765">It came up on a certified -- on a certification procedure and the certified question involved the same question that Judge Haight said was a question of first impression, which had to do with the state of mind, or whether there was a privilege for the editorial process of the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="4109.206" offset="16542239">Further, in regard to the question that the Chief Justice posed to Mr. Abrams as to criminal cases where defendant does take the stand, or any civil case where defendant does take the stand, and the issue of state of mind is an issue, whether it would be because malice or intent required.</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.916" offset="16613083">Obviously, the defendant must answer those questions unless a testimonial privilege against self-incrimination or one of the recognized testimonial privileges is asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4136.621" offset="16651954">In this case, in fact, the defendant, in a pre-trial sense, took the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="4141.548" offset="16671598">He submitted himself to a deposition and questions were asked to him about his state of mind within concrete, factual contexts only because by the decisions of this Court, the subjective state of mind has become the critical Sullivan issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.611" offset="16747875">In regard to the -- again, back to the question of what questions appeared to be allowable, or would not appear to be allowable, I would note that the defendants have objected at the deposition stage, and have contended throughout the appeals here, that questions as to the defendants' view of the credibility and veracity of persons who appeared on the program, as well as persons who did not appear on the program, were not proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="4191.432" offset="16871173">So, that it's not limited to somebody who did not appear on the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="4196.698" offset="16892176">I see both my lights are on and in conclusion, we contend that by precluding a plaintiff from obtaining any direct evidence of state of mind in a Sullivan case, or obtaining any evidence of what happened in the editorial process, whichever way you interpret the two aspects of the Court of Appeals' decision completely unbalances the accommodation struck by this Court in Sullivan and its progeny.</text>
